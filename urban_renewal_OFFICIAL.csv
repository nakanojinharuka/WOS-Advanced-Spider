Although previous theories have explained the factors affecting urban renewal, such studies have failed to identify the differences among the drivers of multifunctional types of urban renewal, leading generalized urban renewal policies to fail. To extend the urban renewal theory from a typological perspective, this paper presents a study that identified the similarities and differences in the mechanisms of the multifunctional types of urban renewal projects implemented in Shenzhen, China. Multisource data, such as planning permits, were used to identify the urban renewal projects implemented in Shenzhen, China, between 2010 and 2020 as well as the prerenewal and postrenewal functions of these projects. The results indicate that 1) the regression model accuracy is 60.3 % for urban renewal as a whole. The classification of urban renewal projects improves the goodness of fit of the regression model by 0.16. 2) Land location, land prices, and policies were found to exert a greater influence on urban renewal than other factors, indicating that public demand plays a weaker role in driving urban renewal projects than the government or developers do. 3) The major types of urban renewal can be categorized into three typical driving modes: government-oriented urban renewal, which includes new industrial and public service projects; production-oriented urban renewal, which includes the conversion of industrial land into commercial or residential functions; and consumption-oriented urban renewal, including new residential projects implemented to accommodate the housing needs of an increasing population. Urban planners and policymakers can apply the results to classify urban renewal projects and adopt appropriate strategies for each type to achieve reasonable resource allocation and sustainable development.",Urban renewal,Spatial governance,Driving forces,Planning permit,The Rent Gap Theory,LAND-USE CHANGE,NEW-YORK-CITY,RENT-GAP,INDUSTRIAL LAND,TOURISM GENTRIFICATION,DECISION-MAKING,REDEVELOPMENT,REGENERATION,EXPERIENCES,POLICIES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the impact of urban renewal on housing prices remains inconclusive, closely tied to the characteristics of the study area, the sources of research data, and so on. To address this, we employ the difference-in-difference method and a mixed panel dataset of housing transactions from 2010 to 2021 to analyze in detail the effects of different urban renewal types (Industrial Renewal, Residential Renewal, and Commercial Renewal) on surrounding housing prices in Bao'an District at different renewal phases (announcement, start, and completion). We found that In-dustrial Renewal exerts the most significant impact on housing prices at the beginning and completion of renewal, followed by Residential Renewal and Commercial Renewal. Moreover, Urban renewal generates both positive and negative externalities on housing prices, especially in the case of numerous small-scale renewal projects. The findings suggest that urban renewal should be supported by systematic research on renewal types, the establishment of scale entry threshold, and the monitoring of the entire process.",Urban renewal types,Housing prices,Stages,Scale,Shenzhen,SCHOOL-DISTRICT,QUALITY,PROJECT,GROWTH,AREA,CITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The research categorizes renewal projects based on changes in buildings, underlying surfaces, and functions. Using the Spearman correlation coefficient and LOWESS method, the study analyzes the relationships between cooling effects and impact factors. The results reveal that transforming industrial areas into commercial or residential zones and transitioning from compact mid-rise to open high-rise structures have significant cooling effects. However, the renewal implementation of the latter transformation can exacerbate the local UHI, suggesting the need for optimizing the timeline of such projects. Increasing vegetation cover plays a crucial role in mitigating the UHI, while higher floor area ratios and building volumes do not necessarily intensify the UHI. To improve the urban ecosystem, urban renewal planning should prioritize the creation of blue and green spaces, incorporation of natural infrastructure, and reduction of impervious surfaces.

Despite the high-value capture capacity of urban renewal projects, value capture cannot be achieved in all urban renewal areas depending on differences in the projects. The aim of this study is to examine public value capture capacity in a renewal project area centrally located, offering high housing demand and supply, and enabling high development rights. The study is based on a scenario work in the Fikirtepe Urban Renewal Project in Istanbul (Turkey). In this study, public value capture capacity is examined by taking into consideration each stage in the urban renewal process. In the process, 'land contribution' from the land of property owners, and 'the infrastructure participation fee' are taken according to plan notes and these can be evaluated within the scope of public value capture. However, these are limited to only 1.8% of the total real estate value.

A multi-scale study",SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY,MAR 2024,7,"Increasing residential segregation is emerging as a hindrance to urban sustainability. Urban renewal projects that claim alignment with sustainable development goals still lack comprehensive studies of their impact on social segregation, as evidenced by the ongoing scholarly debate over whether urban renewal has a positive or negative effect on social segregation. This paper explores the dynamics of urban spatial segregation, analyzes the role of urban renewal on segregation, and bridges the gap in existing research by considering dynamic changes, multiple spatial scales, and diverse renewal types. Using multi -source data - house price data, planning permit data and points of interest -stepwise regression models are combined with t -test methods to examine the impact of multiple types of urban renewal on local and regional residential segregation in Shenzhen. Our findings are as follows: 1) Income -based segregation in Shenzhen increased from 0.77 to 0.81 across neighborhoods, from 0.62 to 0.73 across sub -districts, and from 0.58 to 0.67 across districts between 2000 and 2020, therefore increasing at all scales but with more pronounced growth of segregation observed between units at larger scales; 2) Urban renewal can lead to greater income similarity amongst residents of a sub -district, by attracting more high -income people to move in, but this can lead to increased residential segregation of high- and low-income people at the macro -scale. 3) When assessing the impact of urban renewal on segregation, it is recommended to consider the variations in outcomes resulting from temporal changes, spatial scales, the types of renewal, the types of segregation, and the stages of urbanization.

Such a task is particularly important in an older built environment in many early developed cities, where large-scale urban renewal has been difficult to implement. Consequently, wind corridors are unlikely to be created to transfer heat away from cities, as suggested by previous studies. This study used computer simulations to assess the extent to which changes in building forms could drive wind flow through small-scale renewal sites. The removal of small, fragmented buildings during the renewal process was found to be of great significance for improving local ventilation, which can be regulated through urban design strategies with a low building coverage ratio. Moreover, adjusting the floor area ratio could help create open spaces that benefit on-site and off-site wind environments. This study highlighted small-scale urban renewal projects and their contribution to improving ventilation and mitigating urban heat island effects. These projects can be applied in urban renewal and regeneration through urban design guidelines for the regulation of the spatial distribution of buildings. Of note, wind factors must be integrated into site planning and architectural design processes. In conclusion, the incorporation of wind factors into planning and design processes will help combat urban heat island effects in cities.",Urban design,Urban heat island,Ventilation corridor,Urban renewal,Least cost path (LCP),Computational fluid dynamics (CFD),COMPUTATIONAL FLUID-DYNAMICS,THERMAL COMFORT,LAND-USE,GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE,VENTILATION,IMPACT,CITY,PARK,URBANIZATION,MICROCLIMATE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In another way, achieving sustainable urban development requires more improvements. Equity, sustainability, and universality are core principles of sustainable development and should be integrated into urban renewal strategies. For instance, urban renewal in old town areas presents multiple challenges, including balancing public investment needs, social justice considerations, and environmental impacts. Studies have shown that inequalities often arise during implementation, disproportionately affecting low-income residents in old town areas. While energy justice is a key concept for reducing these inequalities during renewal process, however existing frameworks lack a multi-dimensional approach. This study proposes a comprehensive evaluation framework that combines sustainable development with energy justice principles during the renewal of old town areas. This framework aims to achieve equitable and sustainable development outcomes in renewal of old urban areas by systematically examining the unequal impacts on lowincome groups and proposing equitable energy services and inclusive policies. The proposed equity evaluation framework includes two key components: 1) Main factors in existing renewal strategies, which include equitable access to energy resources, sustainable energy systems, affordability, and public participation. 2) Criteria for refining energy justice evaluation framework, which include accessibility, energy efficiency, community participation, and policy coordination. The research emphasizes the importance of fairness in providing affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy opportunities within urban renewal initiatives. This focus can provide rational perspective and reference for decision makers, thereby empowering vulnerable groups, giving equitable energy access and contributing to achieve sustainable urban development.",Sustainable development,Energy justice,Urban renewal,Low-income groups,INDICATOR SYSTEM,VULNERABILITY,TRANSITIONS,PERSPECTIVE,FRAMEWORK,POVERTY,AREAS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, few studies consider the built environment when assessing urban renewal potential because it is difficult to measure. Street view images can show the physical setting of a place for humans to perceive the built environment. Hence, we separately extracted emotional and visual perceptions from street view images to construct a new comprehensive indicator set to assess multi-class urban renewal potentials. To establish the assessment model, we applied a backpropagation neural network based on the presence and background learning (PBL-BPNN). The renewal potential assessment based on the proposed indi-cator set can reach the highest accuracy. Emotional perceptions contribute more to assessing renewal potential than visual perceptions because they are more consistent in portraying the blighted built environment. Emotionally, the ratings of safety, boring, depression, and lively are stable in the blighted built environment. Visually, greenness and imageability often remain at lower values, highlighting the importance of greenspace and urban furniture in determining urban renewal. Furthermore, multi-class renewal potentials can be used for scenario analysis by assuming different renewal intentions.

However, people often seek unilateral economic benefits and ignore the coupling and coordination degree of economy-social ecological and environmental benefits. This paper attempts to evaluate the success and sustainability of urban renewal projects based on the coupling coordination degree (CCD) of economic-social-ecological benefits. Firstly, this study relies on a literature review and structural interviews to build a coupling indicator system of economic-social-ecological benefits of urban renewal projects and calculates the weight of evaluation indicators based on the entropy method. Taking 15 urban renewal projects in Guangzhou as objects, this research measures their CCD and explores the coupling relationship. The research results show that (1) among the 60 comprehensive benefit evaluation indicator elements of urban renewal projects, the indicator element with a larger weight is ""Education support facilities,"" the economic benefit indicator element with greater weight is ""Regional housing price of renewal areas,"" and the ecological benefit indicator element with a large weight is ""Vitality, and health of the urban landscape, and the characteristics of meeting the needs of residents of all ages."" (2) From the project dimension, the evaluation value of the social, economic, and ecological environment benefits of different reconstruction projects have certain differences. From the perspective of the regional dimension, the CCD of comprehensive benefits of urban renewal projects has obvious regional differences. The projects with a high CCD are mostly distributed in the most economically developed regions. The economic and social benefits of the renewal projects located in the economic core of the city center are usually higher, but their eco-environmental benefits are not necessarily the highest.

During the rapid development, rural villages have been absorbed and transformed into urban villages. Urban villages influence residents' lives and the housing market. However, studies on such interaction are not comprehensive. Although renewal plans have been executed in many Chinese cities, little empirical evidence on the effect of renewal was raised. Most studies obtained an average effect while neglected the varying influences of urban villages on people from different social classes. Thus, the real mechanism of the effect of urban villages and the renewal remains unclear. Therefore, this study uses the hedonic price model, the difference-in-difference model, and the quantile regression model to explore the impact of urban villages and the renewal. The empirical results show that: (1) from the overall perspective, urban villages show negative externalities on the surrounding housing price - housing price drops by 0.005% with every 1% closer to urban villages and decreases by 0.023% with every 1% increase in the scale of urban village; (2) from the social perspective, the effect of urban villages presents significant social heterogeneity - residents of higher-priced housing are more negatively affected by urban village accessibility and scale; and (3) urban village renewal positively affects surrounding housing price and compensates the negative externalities of urban village accessibility and scale. In addition, such compensating effect is significantly higher on higher-priced housing than that on lower-priced housing. The implications of this study help the government to carry out renewal plans orderly, help developers to make targeted investment strategies, and help homebuyers to make suitable purchase decisions, contributing to the sustainable development of cities.",Urban village,Renewal,Externality,Housing price,Hedonic price,Social heterogeneity,HEDONIC ANALYSIS,REDEVELOPMENT,CHENGZHONGCUN,LANDSCAPE,SHENZHEN,INSIGHTS,VALUES,MARKET,LAND,,,,"Ren, Hongfan","Xiong, Taorong",,,,,,,,,

The development intensity of urban renewal (URDI) is an important index to reflect land use efficiency in urban renewal activities, and can serve to control development in a sustainable way. However, research related to URDI and its influencing factors remains scarce in the current literature. Therefore, following a bottom-up paradigm, in this research, the URDI was studied with project data to reveal spatiotemporal distribution characteristics and influencing factors from a microscopic perspective. Specifically, in this study, spatial autocorrelation analysis and a standard deviational ellipse were used to explore spatiotemporal heterogeneity of 483 urban renewal units for 2011-2021 in Shenzhen, one of the major cities implementing urban renewal in China, and influencing factors of the URDI were explored using a panel regression model. The findings reveal that: (1) the URDI is on the rise, presenting a developing trend from core districts to node districts; (2) there was local space mismatch in Shenzhen, with overcrowded or underutilized space in various regions; and (3) the variations in URDI in different regions can be attributed to such factors as investment activity and fiscal revenue.

However, in the ex-ante evaluation of urban renewal projects, TOD and AUD have ambiguous indicators, imprecise weights, and undetermined evaluation methodologies. To fill these gaps, this work combines GIS, fuzzy theory, and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) to build an ex-ante evaluation model for evaluating the sustainability potential of urban renewal projects. Three areas in Guangzhou that are undergoing reconstruction and development are used as empirical instances in this study. This study provides a hierarchical structure of the evaluation framework which contains three dimensions, five criteria, and twenty-seven indicators, and also obtains the influential relationships among five criteria.

In contrast, the existing urban renewal development plan does not adequately utilize the potential of the Shiqiao (SQ) area. This study, therefore, proposes that to increase land-use efficiency and subsequently economic development, the SQ area should either start from the current conditions or adapt its current strategy to renewal.

In designated renewal areas, residents/landowners are often subject to several episodes of waiting: waiting for the public authority for information on redevelopment visions; waiting for the plans and projects to become public; waiting for the court ruling if they appeal the plans; waiting for demolition upon plan approvals; and, finally, waiting for the constructions to be completed. Given the complexity of actors and institutions involved in the waiting, it becomes a conflictual political process. This prolonged waiting leads to an ongoing temporariness and precarious spaces of urban renewal. The course of waiting affects the reorganization of the city space ""now"" and in the future. We analyze two protracted urban renewal projects from Turkey, Fikirtepe in Istanbul and Karabaglar in Izmir, to explore how residents' decade-long waiting for urban change are shaped and how these diverse waiting experiences lead to different outcomes for the progression of the state-imposed urban renewal agendas. While Karabaglar residents have unified around active bottom-up resistance from the beginning to challenge the project-based plans the central government imposed, Fikirtepe residents pursued individual-level negotiations with developers to maximize private returns following the zoning incentives the public authority gave. Despite the socio-spatial similarities between these designated urban renewal project sites, variances in residents' collective waiting strategies have led to different urban politics around project-based urban change.",Waiting,urban renewal,temporal politics,large-scale redevelopment,Turkey,SPACES,STATE,SUBJECTIVITY,TEMPORALITY,ECONOMY,CITIES,SCALE,POWER,TIME,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Urban Renewal is the process of revitalizing these neglected and decayed areas within a city to improve the physical environment and quality of life for residents. Effective urban renewal efforts can transform these environments, enhancing their appeal and livability. However, current research lacks simulation tools that can quantitatively assess and visualize the impacts of renewal efforts, often relying on subjective judgments. Such tools are crucial for planning and implementing effective strategies by providing a clear visualization of potential changes and their impacts. This paper presents a novel framework addressing this gap by using human perception feedback to simulate street environment enhancement. We develop a prompt tuning approach that integrates text-driven Stable Diffusion with human perception feedback, iteratively editing local areas of street view images to better align with perceptions of beauty, liveliness, and safety. Our experiments show that this framework significantly improves perceptions of urban environments, with increases of 17.60% in safety, 31.15% in beauty, and 28.82% in liveliness. In contrast, advanced methods like DiffEdit achieve only 2.31%, 11.87%, and 15.84% improvements, respectively.

Third, housing prices in neighborhoods farther away from scenic spots, which were generally lower, even dropped after the renewal.

Moreover, the lower the property rents, the more intense the impact of HFB and the more likely it was to gentrify. It confirms our concern that green urban renewal would probably result in the displacement of the poor and that green initiatives aimed at common human well-being are more beneficial to the wealthy.

Due to the discontinuity and the existence of dead end roads in the recreational path network in old towns, the comfort of residents' recreational activities is restricted. The self-organization of recreational path network means that the top-down planning and design mode is difficult to match the needs of citizens. How to deduce the spatial vitality of recreation planning in a bottom-up mode and then identify potential land plots is an important issue to improve the quality of urban recreational path network. By taking the old town in Guangzhou as an example, this paper constructs the indicators of break degree and spatial vibrancy based on the complex network theory. Then, by using GPS trajectory data to identify the breaks in the existing recreational path network, the identification of discontinuous breaks based on citizen recreation behavior and the activation effect of urban renewal projects are quantitatively discussed, and the potential impacts brought by the implementation of renewal projects are simulated. The discontinuity analysis shows that the break degree of the recreational path network in the old town in Guangzhou is generally low, and the connection degree is good, but there are still some obvious breaks due to the street location and historical problems. Moreover, the results of spatial vibrancy deduction show that urban renewal projects have a positive impact on the self-organized recreational path network, and that the implementation plan and schedule of urban recreation quality improvement projects can be determined according to the deduction analysis results. This study makes a beneficial exploration of urban self-organizing characteristics from the perspectives of planning and transportation, and makes up for the deficiency of top-down planning in considering urban self-organized recreational path network.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Shi, H.",,,,,,,,,,

This is also an example of the city government's active promotion of urban renewal plans to improve the city's appearance. Based on this case study and in order to help develop appropriate urban renewal plans, the authors of this paper present the following four conclusions: (1) Taipei has shear-band displaced landform features and the shear banding effect keeps the onsite low-plastic silt alluvium in a soft state; (2) the static and seismic ultimate bearing capacities of building foundations are seriously overestimated due to improper assumptions made in the derivation of the relevant formulas; (3) the old four-floor building would have remained safe during a tectonic earthquake; however, the new twenty-story building does not remain safe during a tectonic earthquake; and (4) landlords will benefit greatly from urban renewal but only if their buildings remain safe after reconstruction. In this case study, the new twenty-story building was found to be unsafe during a tectonic earthquake, and the landlord could therefore risk heavy losses. Therefore, the authors suggest that before a large number of urban renewal plans are promoted in Taipei, the seismic design codes for buildings should be revised so that the static and seismic ultimate bearing capacities of the proposed building foundations can be correctly calculated. This is the only way to ensure that buildings complying with seismic design specifications remain safe during tectonic earthquakes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Tsai-fu chuang,,,,,,,,,,

The findings show that urban redevelopment practices have profoundly transformed industrial land use in the recent urban renewal process. Market actors implement industrial land redevelopment projects with policy guidance. These actors with diversified redevelopment goals have directly shaped the spatial outcomes of industrial land transformation. A small portion of industrial sites has been transformed into public facilities and open space as required by redevelopment policies. At the same time, the majority have been converted into residential and commercial spaces, as well as new industrial spaces for innovative industries under market orientation. Significant spatial differences in regeneration outcomes exist at the urban level. The regression results indicate that policy and planning regulations, and land ownership, are the critical factors affecting the transformation of urban industrial land into different types of land uses.

Urbanization that takes place without taking into account these legal and technical bases lead to the emergence of informal, risky and dysfunctional settlements. Over time, these settlements become increasingly vulnerable due to their failure to meet social and technical requirements, making their sustainability increasingly challenging, and inevitably becoming subjects of urban renewal activities. Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform's archive of satellite images provides temporal monitoring of urbanization on Earth for about 50 years and analysis of changes in the cloud environment. This study investigates whether the GEE platform can use to detect the impact of the areas where settlement activities are carried out without a development plan in the current urban transformation projects in Istanbul. Land use/cover maps classified with the Random Forest algorithm correlate urbanization activities in urban renewal areas with the entry into force date of the spatial plans that guide the settlement. The classification results evaluated in conjunction with statistical tests and spatial plan decisions demonstrate that unplanned urbanization is a serious obstacle to the sustainability of settlements. Additionally, the study results show the performance of the GEE platform in detecting the effects of factors in the urbanization period.

These regions, with their diverse architectural styles, have traditionally required extensive preliminary research, often leading to subjective results. However, the advent of machine learning models has opened up new avenues for generating building facade images. Despite this, creating high-quality images for historical district renovations remains challenging, due to the complexity and diversity inherent in such districts. In response to these challenges, our study introduces a new methodology for automatically generating images of historical arcade facades, utilizing Stable Diffusion models conditioned on textual descriptions. By classifying and tagging a variety of arcade styles, we have constructed several realistic arcade facade image datasets. We trained multiple low-rank adaptation (LoRA) models to control the stylistic aspects of the generated images, supplemented by ControlNet models for improved precision and authenticity. Our approach has demonstrated high levels of precision, authenticity, and diversity in the generated images, showing promising potential for real-world urban renewal projects. This new methodology offers a more efficient and accurate alternative to conventional design processes in urban renewal, bypassing issues of unconvincing image details, lack of precision, and limited stylistic variety. Future research could focus on integrating this two-dimensional image generation with three-dimensional modeling techniques, providing a more comprehensive solution for renovating architectural facades in historical districts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Li, Y.",,,,,,,,,,

This gap is significant, as many residents must vacate their homes for an average of 3-5 years during Shantytown redevelopment, which brings about challenges of renting houses and the associated negative impacts on their well-being before returning to their resettled homes. Therefore, this study focuses on examining the temporary residence arising during Shantytown redevelopment while awaiting resettlement. We selected Heze city as our case study area, which has been through China's most intensive redevelopment between 2016 and 2018 that affected about 1.2 million population. A structured community survey was conducted, and 1035 valid samples were collected. We then applied spatiotemporal analysis and the Random Forest model to examine stability, direction, and distance of temporary residence mobility, along with its influencing factors. Findings reveal that 92.4% of households move just once or twice during the temporary phase, indicating the preference for stable residence. Regarding moving direction, households seek life service centers rather than city centers, and prefer familiar community environments. Furthermore, 74.8% of households resettled within 2.5 km of their original residence, indicating a preference for nearby temporary housing. The built environment emerged as the most critical factor influencing the mobility, followed by family socioeconomic status, while housing costs, surprisingly, having the minimal impact.

Analyses linked historical structural racism, measured continuously at the census-tract level using archival data sources, to present-day residents' physical health measures drawn from publicly accessible records for Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Outcome measures included average life expectancy and the percentage of residents reporting hypertension, stroke, coronary heart disease, smoking, insufficient sleep, sedentary behavior, and no health insurance coverage. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine separate and additive associations between structural racism and physical health measures. Redlining, probable blockbusting, and urban renewal were associated with shorter life expectancy and a higher prevalence of cardiovascular conditions, risky health behaviors, and residents lacking health insurance coverage. Probable blockbusting and urban renewal had the most consistent correlations with all 8 health measures, while freeway displacement was not reliably associated with health. Additive models explained a greater proportion of variance in health than any individual structural racism measure alone. Moreover, probable blockbusting and urban renewal accounted for relatively more variance in health compared to redlining, suggesting that research should consider these other measures in addition to redlining.

This research addresses this gap by leveraging the lens of place value to examine NMIR's outcomes. Using Wuhan, China, as a case study, 10 Delphi consultations and 28 interviews were conducted among five stakeholder groups: local government, planning professionals, academics, community workers, and residents. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation (FCE) were combined to identify and rank potential indicators. A total of 6 primary and 22 secondary indicators were identified. The indicators were derived from four key policy areas-health, society, economy, and environment-highlighting the relationship among NMIR initiatives, their contribution to place quality, and alignment with policy goals.

Nevertheless, the analysis exposes varied satisfaction levels and divergences in the perceived relevance of indicators among the government, professionals, and the residents, particularly concerning social cohesion. These disparities underscore the layered impacts of NMIR. This research recommends integrating resident feedback with expert insights to enhance place quality in NMIR projects by balancing physical upgrades with social considerations. It also advocates for a continuous, adaptable post-occupancy evaluation system to monitor and support place value over time.

The individual and collective memories of city residents link their identity with place identity. Special features in the landscape and urban fabric help residents differentiate between, and connect with the city's identity. The use of collective memory to identify and retain urban identity during urban renewal projects, however, receives less attention than functional and economic investment considerations. This article investigates the importance of urban landscape identity during urban renewal. It postulates that a city's individual and collective memory is important in maintaining its uniqueness in terms of urban landscape identity, but requires economic investment to maintain basic physical comfort and access. A qualitative research approach with photo-elicitation interviews (PEI) was used to investigate the features that activated the memory of the participants and that were important in contributing to the image of Kisumu City, Kenya. There were ongoing and completed urban renewal projects within Kisumu City at the time of the study, which made it a good case study for postcolonial Africa. Twelve residents (as PEI participants), four officials from the County Government, and four professionals were interviewed as key informants. A field investigation was carried out through mapping and photography in addition to an archival review. The study reveals that the old railway station, the port, and the market featured strongly in collective memory as part of historical trade development. Despite the important role of civic and administrative buildings from the colonial era in the formation of memory, place, and identity, there was also a positive response from residents to the 'new look' of the city. The physical upgrade, decongestion and cleaning of the city, its streets and parks as public spaces resulted in greater safety and public use, which was well appreciated from an investment point of view.

As many LRAs are converted and renovated from underused properties, such as industrial buildings, they have become an integral part of the ongoing urban renewal yet remain insufficiently explored. Through the conceptual lens of spatio-temporal fix and state entrepreneurialism, and drawing on a field investigation in Beijing, this study presents three key findings. First, the renovation and conversion of diverse property stocks into LRAs exemplify a spatial fix strategy to defer the crisis resulting from excessive capital accumulation in the housing sales market over the past two decades. Second, financialization, as an effective political-economic instrument to promote LRA development, provides a temporary fix for the mounting capitalist crisis but may generate new crises if not properly regulated. Third, market practices of renovation and financialization are closely intertwined with and deeply influenced by state initiatives. This paper not only reveals a novel practice of urban renewal through the development of LRAs, but also advances the theoretical understanding of spatio-temporal fix under state entrepreneurialism.

We identified 5 types of typical mismatched areas in Shanghai. Areas with Low-NTL but High-density buildings mainly are old communities, resettlement communities and large industrial parks. Areas with High-NTL but Low-density buildings mainly are new urban development zones and sub-centers. We conclude that the degradation of quality of living environment in urban center areas hinders the promotion of local vitality where urban renewal is needed.

Design/methodology/approach The research design follows a sequential integrated methodology that combines the calculation algorithms of Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (Fuzzy-ANP) with Zero-One Goal Programming (ZOGP) to support decisions for the selection of PCBR projects. In the first phase, general criteria for assessing the sustainability performance of PCBR projects were collected from relevant literature. In the second phase, the Fuzzy-ANP was used to identify the priority weights of the candidate projects through clarifying the interdependent degree between the criteria and candidate projects. Finally, ZOGP method was selected as a predetermined number of PCBR projects among candidate projects. Findings The feasibility and effectiveness of this hybrid approach is then verified in a case study of Yuzhong District, Chongqing in China. The results of this study indicate that the integrated method is capable of directing the decision maker toward the best compromising solution of PCBR program that can achieve the maximization of sustainable benefits and allocate limited resources most efficiently. Originality/value The novelty of this paper consists in combining the algorithms of the Fuzzy-ANP method with those of the ZOGP model that serves as an effective analysis tool to address practical decision problems.

In the existing renewal decision-making, few strategies have been formulated with the goal of promoting the lowcarbon development. As a fundamental building block of a city, low-carbon construction in neighborhoods is already the basis for promoting sustainable cities. Therefore, this study develops a carbon accounting methodology and an efficiency assessment model that are applicable at the neighborhood level to measure the carbon emission characteristics and reduction potential. Then, a decision-making framework for sustainable neighborhood renewal is put forward from the perspective of carbon emission mitigation. Through a case study of fifteen communities in Yuzhong District, Chongqing in China, this study reveals the current situation of community CO2 emission and carbon emission efficiency, and formulates the sustainable renewal paths according to local conditions. Results show that 83.16% (1.68E+08 kg) of the CO2 in the study communities comes from energy consumption, and CO2 absorption is only 1.78% (3.62E+06 kg) of the total emission. Meanwhile, the carbon emission efficiency of the fifteen study communities has a significant heterogeneity, with a mean value of 0.7402, and 80% of these communities are ineffective. These communities are ineffective mainly because the resource investment cannot be fully utilized. For example, the average utilization efficiency values for energy, purchased resources, and natural resources are 0.7427, 0.8113, and 0.4384, respectively. Thus, adopting adaptive renewal strategies to integrate the use of resources can effectively promote the construction of low-carbon neighborhoods.

Small-property-rights housing (SPRH) refers to long-term, large-scale informal housing built on collectively owned land in China. Although Collectively Owned Land Price Assessment Guidance stipulates that SPRH cannot be demolished forcibly without compensation. However, Land Management Law states that compensation standards depend on local governments, resulting in unfair compensation. By integrating the first-difference model (FDM) and the boundary-fixed-effect model into the hedonic pricing model, this study proposes a model of demolition compensation of SPRH based on market value standard, which takes state-owned land compensation standard and residential land floor price into account. Using the case of Nanjing, this study estimates whether Xingdu Garden's demolition compensation deviates from a reasonable level. The results indicate that compensation is reasonable.

The redevelopment plan was formulated based on these evaluation results. To study the effect of the plan, a transition matrix of land use was assessed using satellite images and the cellular automata (CA)-Markov model; based on the analysis, we predicted the land use situation of the Wangping brownfield, with respect to natural development, for 2030.

The idea of a smart city has arisen as one of the potential solutions to this concern. In this study, we have demonstrated how citizen science helps immensely to the growth of a smart city by crowdsourcing data about urban decay. Tehran, the capital of Iran, which is home to the history of many people's social lives, has begun losing some of its vitality. Municipalities have plans for dealing with urban decline and revival, but we indicate that volunteered geographic information (VGI) would be more effective in turning such ideas into practice. According to our research, there are three different types of organizations active in urban renewal: municipalities, civil and urban planning agencies, and organizations that support tourism and cultural heritage. As a result, we provided a system design that outlines the duties that each institution has in relation to urban renewal. In addition, we suggested a service broker with the capacity to publish VGI in order to offer interoperability related to geographic data and services based on spatial data infrastructure (SDI). Beyond that, various types of urban decay, necessary management procedures, the sequence of information in system components, and the volunteer's behavior confronting the system were all specified in the form of an object-oriented design. A prototype system based on state-of-the-art in open-source technologies was developed to test our hypothesis. The VGI system enabled us to monitor urban decay events in real time using the management dashboard. We have shown that volunteers can distinguish between urban declines and typical instances like a binary classifier in the quality control method proposed in this study. Performance was 90% based on the findings of the quality control.

Yet, when it comes to understanding the role of the built environment, a disproportionate focus on redlining obscures other historical policies and practices such as blockbusting, freeway displacement, and urban renewal that may impact contemporary child development. We hypothesized that historical structural racism in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania's, built environment would be associated with fewer contemporary educational, socioeconomic, and health opportunities. We also hypothesized that these measures would explain more collective variance in children's opportunities than redlining alone.METHODS We used geospatial data from the US Census, Mapping Inequality Project, and other archival sources to construct historical measures of redlining, blockbusting, freeway displacement, and urban renewal in ArcGIS at the census tract level. These were linked with data from the Child Opportunity Index 2.0 to measure children's opportunities across domains of education, socioeconomic status, and health. We ran spatial regression analyses in Stata 18.0 to examine individual and collective associations between structural racism and children's opportunities.RESULTS Historical redlining, blockbusting, and urban renewal were largely associated with fewer contemporary educational, socioeconomic, and health opportunities, and explained up to 47.4% of the variance in children's opportunities. The measures collectively explained more variance in children's opportunities than redlining alone.CONCLUSIONS In support of our hypotheses, novel measures of structural racism were related to present-day differences in children's opportunities.

The preservation and transformation of these districts is currently the major component of the urban renewal of China. However, there are problems of excessive commercial development or isolated conservation in the existing renewal projects of Historical and Cultural Districts in China. In this context, the study took Nanshi Street, a typical Historical and Cultural District of Ganzhou City, Jiangxi Province, China, as the research object; analysed the current spatial status of the district through the typo-morphological approach; and proposed a renewal design concept through the creation of sharing communities to solve the existing problems of the district, which are the lack of popularity of public spaces, and the abandonment and inactivity of historical buildings. Analysis yields a spatial typology of the district that can be categorized into building, court yard, streets and alleys, and vacant space. Combining case studies, three study sharing methods are proposed, which are Sharing for All, Sharing by Transfer, and Group Sharing. Regenerating the four space typologies of the district by hierarchically using three sharing methods can effectively solve the problem and revitalize the district. The study provides design suggestions for the transformation of Historical and Cultural Districts in China, so that they can truly integrate into the contemporary urban environment, while at the same time connecting with the urban cultural context and expressing urban characteristics.>",Historical and Cultural Districts,preservation,transformation,sharing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our tensor-field modeling method provides users with a generalized way to encode contextual constraints such as waterfront edges, terrain, view-axis, existing streets, landmarks, and non-geometric design inputs such as network directionality, desired densities of streets, amenities, buildings, and people as forces that modelers can weigh. This allows users to generate many, diverse urban fabric configurations that resemble real-world cities with very few model inputs.

Many mature methods have been used to reduce the risk of flood. The optimal design of impervious surfaces (ODIS) is an adaptive solution to urban flooding from the perspective of urban renewal planning. However, existing ODIS models are limited because they do not consider the drainage systems. To address this issue, this study proposes an elastic and controllable optimization model based on assumptions about rainstorm and drainage capacity, nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II), multivariate linear programming (MLP) and soil conservation service curve number model (SCS-CN) in a case study of the old town of Guangzhou city, China. The model not only coupled the drainage systems, but also collaboratively optimized the impervious surfaces and the drainage systems. The results show that the proposed model achieved an optimized efficiency of 5.70 %, which is more than a tenfold improvement compared to existing ODIS models.

Therefore, this paper proposes the concept of community planning resilience based on resilience theory and explores a framework system for evaluating the planning resilience of renewal and transformation community by taking renewal and transformation future community planning of Zhejiang as the research object. At the same time, the technical path of realizing public participation in community planning is explored through the method, mechanism, and technical platform of fuzzy group decision-making. Finally, the feasibility of the aforementioned framework and approach is experimentally explored and verified based on a typical case of renewal and renovation of future community planning. In order to make community regeneration planning more planning resilient, this paper develops a community planning group decision-making study from the perspective of community planning resilience, which provides a new research perspective for the field of community resilience and provides a reference for community planning evaluation and the construction of resilient communities.In China's advancing urbanization, major cities are grappling with diverse risks, necessitating urban planning and governance with heightened resilience to face unforeseen black swan events and foreseeable gray rhinoceros challenges. This urgency is particularly pronounced in community renewal, prompting a vital shift from rigid to resilient planning methodologies. To address this shift, this paper advocates for resilient community construction to be a focal point in both policy and practical implementation of community regeneration. A novel approach utilizing the fuzzy decision-making method is proposed to establish a comprehensive resilient community renewal decision-making technology support system. This system employs a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, integrating an empowerment approach to simplify the complexities of a multicriteria index system. By mitigating the risks inherent in resilience planning, our approach enhances the scientific foundation and feasibility of decision-making in community renewal.

Residents, as the primary users of the community, have become a vital component of community micro-renewals. With the advent of participatory design, designers are no longer the dominant constructors of communities. Residents' participation is essential to current community micro-renewals, but the existing resident involvement still reflects a lack of initiative and an underutilization of potential. Instead, co-creation, in which residents can be deeply involved in the community micro-renewals, is becoming the mainstream. This paper categorizes co-creation models in community microrenewals into three types according to the degree of residents' participation: the co-creation model based on common ideation, the co-creation model for resident participation in the design process, and the co-creation model of resident-led community regeneration. Three corresponding cases in Shanghai, China are analyzed in relation to specific scenarios and typologies. Each case study provides a contextualized interpretation of the characteristics associated with different types of co-creation. Increased residents' participation in the process of co-creation has been found to positively impact residents' identification with community micro-renewals and their intrinsic commitment to sustain them. Furthermore, highly participatory co-creation empowers residents to assume a higher level of responsibility for the project and mitigates the risk of uniformity. The contribution of this paper is to provide a theoretical basis for subsequent practices.

The irrational decision of urban renewal led to serious economic waste and environmental unsustainability. In this regard, this study proposes and validates a method for regeneration diagnosis and optimal regeneration of RBs based on circular economy (CE) theory. A hybrid diagnostic tool of life cycle cost (LCC)-life cycle assessment (LCA) model to systematically evaluate the economic and environmental impact of RBs throughout the circular lifecycle was proposed. On this basis, with the minimum average annual economic and environmental impact as the objective function, the optimal dynamic regeneration cycle of RBs is obtained using a multi-objective optimization method. The results of the case study show that: (1) The discount rate and deterioration rate changes the development tendency of economic and environmental data, which brings a new regenerating time point, (2) the economic impact of RBs' regeneration tends to be more pronounced during the intermediate stages, while the environmental impact becomes more significant in the later stages, (3) the environmental benefits of regeneration outweigh the economic benefits, (4) the regeneration of all building elements at the local optimal level leads to enhanced comprehensive benefits compared to multiple regenerations of a single building element. The feasibility of the method employed in this study has been corroborated by practical case studies.

Thus, this study used a cross-case analysis to investigate the positive attributes of shrinkage as well as their utilization processes and associated benefits in three shrinking districts in Seoul. The results indicate that the following opportune circumstances could arise: collective actions prompted by people feeling despair after shrinkage; the initiation and spread of small-scale projects that replace a grand plan; the availability of less competitive land and built property for transformative uses; and the rediscovery of local industrial values and know-how. These attributes influence the growth of social capital and civic engagement in local planning and the revitalization of stagnant local economies.

First, to accommodate the multi-day behavioral variability and unobserved heterogeneity in individual characteristics ignored by traditional parking surveys, multi-day stated-preference(SP) and revealed-preference(RP) data collected in Xi'an were used to analyze people's parking choice behavioral characteristics. The questionnaires were designed by SPSS software with orthogonal design principles.

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, which focus on the estimation of indoor airflow are not conclusive about the impact of using Heat, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems on diseases' transmission risk while travelling with open windows has shown to be a good strategy to renew the indoor air. In order to estimate the COVID-2 airborne transmission by aerosols, a real urban bus was simulated by CFD. Twenty passengers (containing the driver) were included in the model with a typical inhalation-exhalation breathing cycle. The concentrations of air exhaled by ten of them were tracked during 30 min using Eulerian scalar tracer, and the concentrations inhaled by the twenty passengers were monitored. Then, the well-known Wells & Riley risk model was applied in order to estimate the cumulative inhaled viruses and the subsequent transmission risk.Four scenarios were considered: HVAC off with closed windows (Case 1), HVAC on with closed windows and 100% of air recirculation (Case 2), HVAC on with closed windows and 75% of air recirculation (Case 3), and HVAC off and the bus moving at 20 km/h with some windows opened (Case 4).

As a concept, cadastral renewal refers to digitising the cadastral plan and correcting errors because of cadastre in the legal land registry information, updating them in a format and structure to create infrastructure for spatial information systems, making them available for use. Before 1987, cadastral work was conducted following various production methods and laws of the period. As a result of rapid urbanisation, the transformation of rural areas into urban areas, and the increase in the value of parcels, the delay in land-related investment projects because cadastral data and technical documents do not meet the expectations of accuracy and completeness, has been discussed for a long time in the country. Cadastral renewal projects carried out in places of urgent need because of technical and legal problems have become state policies with the Land Registry and Cadastre Modernization Project (TKMP), initiated in 2007 using the resources provided by the World Bank. In this project, it was determined that 22.3 million of the existing 58.3 million cadastral parcels in Turkiye should be renewed. As of 2021, approximately 14 million parcels have been renewed by the participation of the private sector while the renewal of the rest has been ongoing. This study examined the adequacy of the existing land registry and cadastre data within the scope of rural cadastral renewal. In this framework, the cadastral technical file, land book, and land registry information in the Land Registry and Cadastre Information System (TAKBIS) were compared within the classification framework, and their differences were determined. In addition, the parcel areas calculated by initial cadastral surveys years ago to establish the cadastre were compared with the legal areas and new areas of the parcels calculated after the renewal. It was found that 90.37% of the parcel areas calculated based on the initial surveys were consistent with those calculated after the renewal, whereas 67.47% were consistent with the legal areas within the tolerance values. According to these results, supported by other findings, cost-effective and rapid cadastre renewal has been proposed.",Cadastre,Cadastre renewal,Legal parcel area,Land registry,The Turkish cadastre,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the spatial location and development intensity of the urban area need to be developed considering traffic capacity and demand. This enhances land value after development and promotes sustainable development and organic renewal. Application of Geographic Information System (GIS) coupling with the coordination pattern evaluation system was also required. For the evaluation of traffic supply and demand, the entropy weight method was used to measure three indexes: road network density, traffic accessibility, and traffic facility service level. Traffic capacity demand was measured by the amount of travel generated by different types of land uses. The coupling coordination model was used to evaluate the balance between the supply and demand of traffic capacity. According to the mixing degree and regulation law of land use, the optimal control of land use and the road was proposed to provide a basis for decision-making on the regeneration and construction of the ancient city.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Finally, the building update directions detected from multiple agents are collaborated in a crowd-sourcing manner to estimate the overall update probability of buildings. A simulation and a real experiment are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Thus, ensuring unimpeded passage for ambulances on streets is a key focus of urban renewal and street governance initiatives. However, the identification of bottlenecks for emergency vehicle passage on urban streets currently relies on labor-intensive and inefficient on-site manual audits. This study proposes a deep learning-based approach to achieve automatic identification of ambulance passage on urban streets. The Vision Transformer network is utilized to construct the classification model of Impassable Narrow Roads, Passable Narrow Roads, and Wide Roads based on street view images. To train and test the constructed models, a specialized dataset is established, consisting of street view images labeled by experienced ambulance drivers. Comparative experiments are conducted to confirm the optimal structure of the model and the necessity of semantic segmentation preprocessing for street view images. To confirm the superiority of the proposed approach, four commonly used deep learning methods, MobileNet, ShuffleNet, SuperViT and DualViT serve as the baseline tests. Experimental results reveal that the model with four-head and one sequential encoder achieves the highest evaluation accuracy at 75.65% among the proposed models on the original dataset, significantly outperforming benchmark models. Meanwhile, the segmentation of street view images improves accuracy to 77.42%, but it reduces computational efficiency from 0.01 to 3 seconds per image. Finally, the optimal model is applied to the area within the Second Ring Road of Beijing as an example to discuss how the deep learning-based approach proposed in this paper supports urban planning practice and emergency medical response. The proposed approach facilitates the rapid and large-scale identification of bottlenecks in urban streets for ambulances with very limited costs, making a significant contribution to the accurate identification of key areas for urban renewal and street governance efforts.

Multifractal analysis is a powerful tool to model multifractal structures. However, due to the use of statistical moments to delineate the multifractal spectrum for multifractal analysis, the great majority of existing studies cannot map urban multifractal structures to geographic space. Lack of geographic mapping makes it difficult to interpret the causes of the anomalous scaling characteristics of urban multifractal structures. For the few mappable multifractal structure modeling methods, they model multifractal structures from a global or local perspective that generates inadequate or redundant scaling characteristics. Here, a classification-based multifractal analysis method (CMFA) was proposed to overcome the shortcomings. It classifies the urban areas into zones according to the density of urban elements and builds up the multi-scaling relationships of urban elements for each zone. The corresponding multifractal structures can be mapped according to the spatial distribution of zones across scales. A case study was conducted to identify the multifractal structures of nighttime light in Beijing, China, to verify the CMFA method. In conclusion, when there are abnormal scaling characteristics reflected by the multifractal spectrum, the multifractal structure maps can diagnose the land use problems leading to disordered spatial organization patterns.

However, limited attention has been paid to detecting these mismatched commuting patterns and their associations with built environmental characteristics. To maximize the effectiveness of urban facility allocation and improve commuting efficiency, this paper developed a framework to identify anomalous commuting interaction patterns. A weighted bipartite network considering urban land attractiveness was first constructed to analyze the commuting flows between urban units. Then a modified Hungarian algorithm was proposed to obtain the optimal commuting interaction fluxes. By comparing real and optimal interaction fluxes, two types of commuting anomalies were detected. Finally, the machine learning model was used to explore the non-linear relationships between built environment and anomalous commuting patterns. Results show the spatial distribution of areas with significant anomalous interactions and the difference between overload- and underload- related anomalous commuting patterns. Potential urban sub-centers were identified to adjust the urban spatial layouts. Besides, the nonlinear and threshold effects of the built environment on the two anomalous commuting patterns were confirmed, which can provide references for urban spatial renewal and commuting flow allocation.",Anomalous commuting patterns,Bipartite network,Built environment,Machine learning model,Non-linear effects,BUILT ENVIRONMENT,BIG DATA,HUMAN MOBILITY,CHINA,MODEL,TRANSPORTATION,CHOICE,SPACE,SCALE,TIME,,,,"Liu, Yaolin","Chen, Huiting","Xu, Jiwei","Fu, Shihang",,,,,,,

Accurate flow prediction optimizes routes and resource allocation, benefiting residents, businesses, and the environment. However, few methods address the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of urban flows. Existing methods typically capture spatial features solely from urban flows, but spatial feature sensitivity becomes a bottleneck when dealing with small or noisy datasets. To address this issue, we propose a method for urban flow prediction via mutual reinforcement with multi-scale regional information (MR-UFP). Firstly, we employ spatial-temporal random masking and spatial-temporal contrastive learning pre-training to directly mine spatial-temporal heterogeneity from historical flow data. Secondly, we transform the task of spatial feature extraction and embedding for urban flow prediction into a mutual reinforcement task by multi-scale region classification auxiliary task. The adaptive environment fusion module and real-time graph processing dynamically correlate regional and environmental features during flow prediction. To balance the mutual reinforcement of the two tasks, we design a joint loss function to optimize feature embedding and feedback correction, ensuring robust and accurate urban flow prediction. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that MR-UFP outperforms baseline models, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness even with minimal data.",Mutual reinforcement,Urban flow prediction,Multi-scale region information,Spatial-temporal systems,Neural networks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wu, Xiaoming","Dong, Xiangjun","Guo, Ying","Zhao, Long","Zhang, Chengqi",,,,,,

First, smart city pilot policy in megacities has significant impact on urban greenness, primarily due to demographic and economic developments. Second, the impact is different between the megacity and national level, and different factors of urban greenness have different effects on smart city construction. Third, the effects are time-lagged and lasted for years, and regional heterogeneity divided by building climate zones is existed, where the effect is more obvious in city agglomeration.

An area-wide portfolio selection approach considering interaction effects and multiple objectives,ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW,NOV 2023,5,"Urban regeneration is a crucial approach in addressing urban decay and improving the urban living environment. However, the viability of urban regeneration projects (URP) is largely determined by their investment value. This makes it challenging to promote non- or low-profitable URP in many cases. Lacking sufficient market value, such projects tend to rely heavily on limited public resources, which can be a significant burden on society. To address this issue, it is necessary to establish an appropriate area-wide project portfolio selection approach to comprehensively plan and implement URP. Previous studies have focused on single project scales and failed to consider project interdependencies and the multiple objectives of URP. Therefore, this study develops a multi-objective optimization approach for URP portfolio selection that integrates project interdependencies and multiple objectives into a comprehensive mathematical model. The NSGA-II and the TOPSIS are used to obtain trade-off solutions from the Pareto-optimal set. The approach is utilized to a case of Chongqing, China, showcasing its effectiveness in guiding decision-makers towards an optimal URP portfolio that maximizes sustainable benefits. This approach provides new insights into the balance between functional adaptability, resource sustainability, and land utilization efficiency in urban built-up areas.",Urban regeneration project,Multi-objective optimization,Portfolio selection,Area-wide,DECISION-MAKING APPROACH,RENEWAL,OPTIMIZATION,METHODOLOGY,MANAGEMENT,INTERDEPENDENCY,SUSTAINABILITY,UNCERTAINTY,SUPPORT,SCALE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The following points were obtained: (1) We developed an evaluation model to identify vacant residential buildings in shrinking cities by removing the contribution of nighttime lights from roads and non-residential buildings; (2) The residential building vacancy rate in Fushun city significantly increased from 2013 to 2020, resulting in a significant high-value clustering effect. The impact of urban shrinkage on vacant residential buildings was higher than that on vacant non-residential buildings; (3) The WorldPop population data demonstrated consistent spatial distribution and trend of population change in Fushun with the residential building vacancy rate results, suggesting good reliability of the constructed evaluation model in this study.

Previous studies have analyzed the mechanisms of land redevelopment at the urban and neighborhood scales, but little attention has been paid to its spatial heterogeneity at national scales, making it impossible to measure the role of macro factors and the central government, and the differences in the driving factors across cities. Using a city-level database of 287 Chinese cities from 2012 to 2018, this paper quantitatively reveals the spatial heterogeneity of land redevelopment among different regions, administrative levels, and city sizes, and analyzes how government and market forces generate such geographic characteristics. The findings reveal that: 1) The national land redevelopment ratio increased from 26.44% in 2012 to 31.95% in 2018, with an average yearly rise of 1%. 2) Eastern cities have the largest land redevelopment scale, while Northeastern cities have the highest proportion of land redevelopment, accounting for about 40%. Despite having the highest amount of land redevelopment, high-level administrative cities and large cities do not have a higher proportion of land redevelopment than other cities. 3) Market mechanism is imperfect and unbalanced. Foreign direct investment affects land redevelopment in eastern cities with a coefficient of 0.19, while real estate development affects the western cities and small cities, with coefficients of 1.72 and 1.11, respectively.

However, this article challenges the perception that urban regeneration is primarily a policy driver that leads to the displacement of residents, and by proposing an investigation of how urban regeneration also constitutes an opportunity for homeowners to achieve 'In-Place Social Mobility' (IPSM) - that is, social mobility without leaving their homes and neighborhoods. At a time when the welfare and social service system is weakening, residential property values are increasing, and wages remain stagnant, individuals must turn their homes into investment assets in order to increase their social opportunities. Following the Planning Deal and the Regeneration Deal, the interpretative scheme of the 'Social Deal' incorporates two fields: the city as a growth machine, and the social mobility of the homeowners. Through the theoretical demonstration of the notion of IPSM through urban regeneration in Israel, we propose the Social Deal as a new way of understanding the rent gap discussion - i.e., not only as a result of the cultural preferences of consumers on the one hand, or of real estate developers and market supply on the other hand, but also as a means to the self-profit of the residents.",Displacement,homeownership,urban regeneration,house price inflation,rent gap,Israel,GENTRIFICATION,CITY,RENEWAL,POLICY,STATE,MODEL,NEOLIBERALISM,BACK,HOME,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The number of variables affecting the occurrence of vacant houses increased in regions with a high housing vacancy rate and differed according to regional characteristics. The predictive factors for the occurrence of vacant houses in Shizuoka Prefecture were greatly influenced by population, society, and industry. Shizuoka Prefecture needs social policies to stimulate the influx of young people to mitigate the occurrence of vacant houses. Meanwhile, the weather data on daylight hours, number of days with precipitation, and number of days with strong wind showed a correlation with the vacancy rate. Thus, weather data must be considered in urban planning.

Long established in many Western contexts, community gardens were not evident in China until a group of scholar-activists in Shanghai initiated the practice in 2016. Drawing on two flagship community garden cases in that city, we investigate the emergence and development of community gardens and discuss the ways in which they instantiate neither a radical nor a neoliberal political vision. Our observations show that a nonprofit organization-rather than the local citizenry or municipal government-proactively advanced the production of community gardens and the discursive construction of community participation over time. The rationale underlying this practice arises from organizers' framing of the community gardens as an ""experiment of governance innovation"" that dovetails with a broader reorientation of China's urban renewal agenda from demolition and reconstruction toward a people-centered incremental urban regeneration characterized by mass mobilization and social participation. We argue, therefore, that the community garden phenomenon reifies an alternative subjectivity-one that emphasizes the increasing visibility of social organizations as a state ""flanking mechanism"" to achieve extraeconomic objectives in urban governance. We also advance a pluralist understanding of China's urban governance beyond a growth-chasing logic to embrace the increasing complexity of the state ethos and societal instruments at play in and associated with this sphere.",China,community garden,interstitial space,regeneration,urban governance,PUBLIC GREEN SPACE,NEW-YORK,CIVIL-SOCIETY,CITIES,STATE,GOVERNANCE,CITY,ENTREPRENEURIALISM,AGRICULTURE,GEOGRAPHIES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the centralised dynamic context for China's urban regeneration, the institutional arrangements and practices of public participation and the evolution processes between them still remain ""black boxes"". This paper aims to clarify the institutionalisation process of public participation in China's urban regeneration. Using the historical institutionalism perspective, this research adapts the institutionalisation framework proposed by Burns and Scapens (2000) to the analysis of participatory governance in China's planning context. It analyses three phases of urban regeneration in Guangzhou and provides corresponding case studies for an in-depth analysis. The findings reveal that the success of public participation in urban regeneration varies across phases, mainly due to the degree of government power sharing and the inclusion of nongovernmental actors in decision-making through genuinely participative interactions. This research develops an institutionalisation analysis framework and notes that the proposed institutionalisation path only partially applies to public participation in China's urban regeneration. The institutionalisation of public participation from the institutional realm to the realm of action in China's regeneration practices departs from hysteresis, which is the opposite of synchronisation in historical institutionalism. The root cause of this inefficient institutionalisation and its separation from practice is the imbalance in the allocation of power resources.

Through a combination of online and offline questionnaires, the authors learned about the current situation of young consumer behavioral preferences for urban commercial revitalization projects. A theory of planned behavior model was then built to empirically analyze the factors influencing consumer behavioral preferences in these projects. Based on the results of our analysis, we propose goals and suggestions for the government, property developers, and citizens involved in revitalization projects to support urban commercial revitalization and promote consumers' consumption intentions. Governments emphasize the importance of culture and give more directions to maintain historical elements. From the perspective of property developers, a business format combining culture and the market is necessary.

The effects of indirect stakeholders in historic urban regeneration",CITIES,JUN 2024,0,"The conflict between public and private interests has become a focal point of contention among various parties in the process of expropriation and relocation for historic urban regeneration. Failures to properly resolve such conflict often lead to impeded urban regeneration and/or loss of cultural values. Although previous studies have analyzed the mediating role of various types of indirect stakeholders in historic urban regeneration, they have not further examined various effects of indirect stakeholders. Inspired by the theories of dependence, deterrence, and agency among stakeholders, this study explains the different effects of indirect stakeholders on the three parties (government, developers, and residents) following the evolutionary game theory. Specifically, replicator dynamics equations are established to simulate the evolution paths of the government, developers, and residents in the tripartite game involving indirect stakeholders through a case study for the historic regeneration of Zhongshan Road in Nanning, China. Modeling parameters are obtained through semi-structured interviews and quantified analyses of policy documents. The results reveal that indirect stakeholders (1) show a positive ally effect benefiting the stability of government strategies, (2) have a negative deterrent effect conducive to the stable evolution of developers, and (3) have an indirect leverage effect on the evolution of residents. Our study makes contributions by (1) designing a new indirect stakeholder mechanism to urban regeneration, and (2) establishing a new analysis framework for the tripartite game in urban regeneration.

Given that state-dominated urban redevelopment is slow and limited, the Chinese government has proposed a pioneering market-oriented approach to drive urban redevelopment in Shenzhen. This study seeks to examine the impacts of market-oriented institutional arrangements on land redevelopment approval duration (LRAD) in China from the perspective of public and private interests. Various institutional arrangements are observed under the institutional change of urban redevelopment in Shenzhen, and they are differed by the nature of the applicants, including the original property owners (old factory owner (OFO)), their representatives (e.g., village committees (VC) and the government agency involved in redevelopment (URB)), and developers (DP, second-hand property owner). A number of hypotheses are developed, and empirical tests are conducted to verify or dismiss our hypotheses with the data in Shenzhen. The empirical findings indicate that (1) The LRAD is the shortest when the applicant is the OFO and the longest if the applicant is the local government officials such as URB. (2) Compared with the URB, the LRAD is shorter if the VC is the applicant. (3) The LRAD is longer for the projects with a larger redevelopment scale and the projects with more dedicated public facilities.

However, the factors affecting plant diversity under rapid urbanization remain unknown in many cities. To this end,702 vegetation sampling plots from 219 2 km x 2 km grids were selected to explore the urban plant biodiversity variation within two perpendicular 10 km width transects running across the urban center in north-south and east-west directions within the 6th ring road in Beijing, China.

These shortcomings make it challenging to meet the requirements of urban spatial change detection and disaster response and recovery. Therefore, this paper proposes a building change detection method based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect changes in buildings in multi-temporal remote sensing images, which was verified using two remote sensing images before and after the Turkiye earthquake on February 6, 2023. In this method, we improved DenseNet 121 to serve as a key component of the deep learning model, utilizing dense connections between layers to improve feature propagation efficiency and enhance the capture of graphic details. Simultaneously, we designed a novel loss function based on the Tanimoto coefficient to measure the difference between the predicted segmentation map and the live segmentation map. Experimental results show that the proposed building change detection method is effective in detecting building collapse in earthquake disasters, with a quantitative accuracy of F1 score exceeding 70%.

Flint's urban structure is homogenous with repetitive blocks of privatelyowned single-family housing, presenting a barrier for public intervention in vacancy.

In order to reveal the morphological evolution of such craft streets, this study takes the example of a tie-dye street in Zhoucheng, Xizhou Town, Dali, and combines documentary research with historical maps and corroboration through field surveys to obtain the street morphology of the craft street in Zhoucheng, Dali, in both historical and contemporary periods. The study found that 1) the tie-dye street was formed due to the transportation of goods by horse gangs, and its morphology was deeply influenced by the historical tea and horse routes; 2) the tie-dye street is a self-organised spatial morphology with the Sifang Street as its spatial core; and 3) the tie-dye street has emerged as a new spatial morphology due to the tourism behaviour. The exploration of the relationship between the morphological evolution of Zhoucheng Craft Street and urban development helps architects and urban designers to understand how to design urban street spaces with tie-dye crafts as the highlight, while suggesting new possibilities for the modern renewal of the original historical street.",craft street,spatial form,historical map,urban design,tie-dye,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To better understand the impact of urban green space coverage's spatial pattern on land surface temperature (LST), this study selected three sample areas along the urban-rural gradient in Shanghai. Using LST inversion and resampling methods, LST data for different grid sizes were obtained for spring, summer, and winter in the 2010s, 2015s, and 2020 s. A boosting regression tree model was employed to determine the key indicators affecting LST and effective cooling thresholds. The impact of green quality, structure, and pattern at the community scale on LST was discussed, providing feasible suggestions for green space planning and design in different urban spaces. The study found significant differences in the spatial patterns of green areas and LST among the three sample regions. The quantity and integrity of green spaces in the Huangpu, Minhang, and Songjiang sample areas have progressively improved, with overall green coverages of 19 %, 38 %, and 43 %, respectively. As grid size increases, the relative influence of fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) on LST generally decreases, whereas the relative influence of green structure and patterns gradually increases. Taking the summer of the 2020 s as an example, the influence of FVC on the three study sample areas was 80.79, 83.36, and 87.18 at a 30 m grid size, which decreased to 48.87, 40.59, and 47.64 at a 120 m grid size. The green structure's impact rose from 13.09, 15.22, and 10.6-30.01, 51.82, and 38.5; the influence of green patterns increased from 6.12, 1.42, and 2.21-21.13, 7.6, and 13.86. Key indicators affecting LST include FVC (Fractional Vegetation Coverage), AREA (Green Patch Area), PD (Patch Density), COHESION (Patch Cohesion Index), and ED (Edge Density). High temperatures in summer are one of the ecological issues that need special attention in Shanghai's green space design. Setting the green space proportion to 35 % while avoiding fragmentation and low vegetation coverage can achieve effective cooling. This study's main advancement lies in utilizing machine learning algorithms to identify the principal green spatial pattern impact factors and key thresholds influencing LST at the community scale in Shanghai. The related results and proposed strategies provide a research framework and strong basis for special regulations in urban green space system planning concerning urban thermal environments. They offer references for urban renewal and new town planning to address climate change and urban high-temperature issues, such as clear requirements for optimal green space area at the community scale, community park spatial layout and quantity regulations, and urban park planning design suggestions. This study also highlights obstacles in the practical application of planning and design strategies, which can help avoid difficulties in implementing planning policies.

It is hence essential to identify their forming factors and analyze their spatial distribution features, so as to pave the way for sinkhole risk assessment and mitigation for urban sustainable development. Investigation of urban sinkholes poses a significant challenge because of the multi-factor's confusion, as well as the spatial uncertainties in susceptibility mapping due to urban renewal frequently. To address these issues, a comprehensive urban sinkhole risk assessment framework was proposed, and Shenzhen city in South China was selected as a case study area, where a lot of sinkholes occurred along with intensive human construction activities in recent years. Initially, the sinkhole susceptibility map was drawn using the grey relation analysis (GRA) method, incorporating the spatial information database of meteorology, geology, metro and pipeline systems, and then both the sinkhole density map and the time-varying land subsidence monitoring database were used to verify the accuracy of the sinkhole susceptibility map. Furthermore, the sinkhole risk assessment map in transportation system was subsequently drawn based on the susceptibility map, where the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and the advanced geophysical exploration technologies were employed to probe the potential sinkholes in critical risk areas. The conclusions reveal that the sinkhole susceptibility map based on GRA method demonstrates a promise in identifying the likelihood of urban sinkholes, and the risk assessment framework can be employed for the prevention and remediation of urban sinkholes, which contributes to an economical and efficient scheme for sinkhole detection, as well as transportation system resilience assessment at a city-wide scale.",Sinkhole,Spatial distribution,Susceptibility mapping,Risk assessment,Grey relation analysis,MANTLED EVAPORITE KARST,GROUND SUBSIDENCE,AREA,HAZARD,MINE,CITY,,,,,,,,"Tan, Fei","Zhu, Hua-Mei","Wei, Hui -Long","Zhang, Qian-Bing",,,,,,,

This study explored the relationship between new-type urbanization construction and haze pollution by constructing a time-varying DID model based on 2013-2018 district and county data. Our empirical results show that new-type urbanization can significantly improve haze pollution. We also examined the heterogeneous differences in new-type urbanization's effects on haze pollution. First, we find that new urbanization construction has no significant effect on haze pollution in cities rich in natural resources. Second, its effect on haze pollution was most pronounced in the eastern region, which had the highest urbanization rate. This study also explored the moderating effect of new urbanization and haze pollution from the urban governance perspective. The results show that the government's fiscal spending capacity is significant for new-type urbanization's ability to improve haze pollution. In addition, in the pilot year, the turnover of regional officials enhanced new-type urbanization construction to improve haze pollution. We also find that districts and counties implementing pilot new-type urbanization are conducive to reducing haze pollution in surrounding areas in the same city not implementing new-type urbanization; however, they exacerbate haze pollution in other provincial areas that have not implemented new-type urbanization.

It consists of four dimensions: configuration of network, geometry of network, configuration of area, and geometry of area. These dimensions are formed by the intersection of the two coordinates of perspective and object. Based on their measurement, the overall characteristics of the superblocks are represented and compared through matrix diagrams. Subsequently, the validity and adaptability of this quantitative approach are verified through an empirical analysis of Nanjing's old city superblocks. The results reveal the morphological type of superblocks, and their causes are analyzed through the correlation with the urban environmental background. hierarchy matrix is potentially a useful method for studying the complex emerging built form of rapidly changing cities, especially in developing countries, such as China.

Through structural equation modeling, an empirical analysis was performed on the questionnaire data of 240 visitors to the Xuhui Waterfront in Shanghai, China. The results reveal that service facility and public expectation are the most important factors determining public satisfaction, followed by spatial design and perceived value. However, public expectation does not have a remarkable direct impact on public satisfaction and only indirectly affects public satisfaction through service facility, spatial design, and perceived value. Moreover, it is ascertained that public satisfaction plays a crucial role in affecting public support and complaint toward waterfront redevelopment.

Therefore, understanding the driving mechanism of spatial differentiation in resettlement communities could provide necessary ideas when determining the appropriate path to improve the living function of the resettlement community. In this study, 218 resettlement communities that have been built and put into use in Xi'an (Shaanxi Province, China) were selected as research samples. With the help of ArcGIS and a multivariate logistic model, this study analyzes the spatial differentiation of resettlement communities and its driving mechanism from the perspective of dual-dimensional living functions. Moreover, measuring the spatial differentiation based on the dual-dimensional living function can explore the differentiated living conditions that are presented by residents' access to spatial resources from the people-oriented.

The economic resilience evaluation has been constructed from three levels: risk resistance ability, organization and adjustment ability, as well as renewal and development ability. The difference-in-differences (DID) model and spatial difference-in-differences (SDID) model are adopted to analyze the impact of the HSR service intensity on the urban economic resilience. Results imply that the HSR has significantly improved the urban economic resilience along the lines. Further analysis shows that HSR mainly increases the economic resilience through potential effect of human resources, dynamic effect of new economic sectors and vitality effect of innovation output. From a spatial spillover perspective, HSR not only improves the local economic resilience, but also improves that of neighboring cities. The spatial spillover effect of HSR conforms to the law of geographic distance attenuation with spillover coefficient changes. Moreover, the study documents a series of heterogeneity analysis concerning HSR effects across Chinese cities. Particularly, HSRs promote the development of talents, new economic sectors, as well as innovation output, and help resource-based cities unlock their over-reliance on resource industries, thereby improving their economic resilience. This paper introduces the concept of urban economic resilience into the analysis framework of HSR effect, and measures the geographical boundary and effective scope of the HSR's spillover effect.

However, distinguishing UCSs from other land covers remains challenging, whether using spatial texture and spectral features or time-series characteristics. There is an urgent need for a universally applicable UCS mapping method at the national scale, a gap that current research has yet to fill.

Additionally, we combine the UCS mapping results with SDGSAT-1 GLI data to evaluate the utilization status of new construction areas, thereby supporting SDG 11.3. The results showed that, for six representative cities, the F1-Score and Matthews Correlation Coefficients (MCC) for exposed UCS mapping results ranged from 98.83 % to 99.49 % and from 0.64 to 0.77, respectively.

However, obtaining a holistic spatial-temporal scene representation is difficult because places are often composed of multiple images from different angles, times and locations. This problem also exists in other types of geo-tagged imagery. To solve it, we propose a purely visual, robust, and reliable method for urban function identification at the street scale. We introduce a method based on a two-layer spatially dependent graph neural network structure, which handles sequential street view imagery as input (typically available in services such as Google Street View, Baidu Maps, and Mapillary), with full consideration of the spatial dependencies among road networks. In this paper, we construct an urban topological map network using OpenStreetMap data in Wuhan, China, and compute a semantic representation of the scene as a whole at the street scale using a large-scale pre-trained model. We construct the graph network with streets as nodes based on 28,693 mapping relationships constructed from 75,628 street view images and 5,458 streets.

The sustainable development of these areas is a complex subject that continually garners attention in the field of urban planning. Optimizing their spatial quality necessitates an in-depth understanding of public needs, along with careful consideration of the connection between physical attributes and public perception. Advancements in big data and machine learning have paved the way for the multidimensional evaluation of spatial quality in historic urban areas. In this light, our research proposed a new evaluation system and optimization strategy rooted in the unique attributes and cultural values of these areas. Our empirical research focused on Suzhou Ancient Urban, a representative historic urban area in China. First, we identified six indicators, including appearance, order, atmosphere, and scale, to evaluate the public's perception of the streets in Suzhou Ancient Urban, a place rich with cultural history and local characteristics. This evaluation resulted in a perception map of this area. Second, we explored the unique planning structure, functional distribution, and visual elements of Suzhou Ancient Urban. Using spatial syntax, points of interest (POIs), social media post data processed via natural language processing (SnowNLP), and semantic segmentation methods, we connected the physical attributes of the area with public behavioral preferences and perceptions. This macro-to-micro approach combined subjective and objective evaluations to measure spatial quality. Finally, we established a database for organic urban renewal, which highlights the spatial characteristics of historic urban areas that the public preferred. Our findings indicate that the spaces with higher accessibility in Suzhou Ancient Urban scored better in terms of overall perception. Furthermore, highly distinctive and accessible spaces were the most attractive to the public. Elements such as buildings and walls negatively impacted perception, while infrastructure elements such as roads, pavements, and greenery had a positive effect. This research evaluated the spatial quality of streets in historic urban areas with a special focus on public perception. By combining objective factors such as street accessibility, attractiveness, and visual elements, we discuss the influence of urban structure, function, and components on spatial quality. Our approach, founded on the specific spatial-geographical context of historic urban areas, offered a new methodology for optimizing their quality by integrating subjective and objective factors. Ultimately, our research aimed to foster digital and sustainable development in historic urban areas.>",Street view,Historic urban areas,Urban perception,Space syntax,Points of interest,Social media posts,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Han, Xin",,,,,,,,,,

However, there is a serious lack of environmental impact assessment towards city-scale demolition waste management (DWM), particularly from the systematical and dynamical perspective. Traditionally the assessment has been conducted from a static perspective. The purpose of this paper is to comprehensively evaluate the environmental impact of city-scale DWM from a complex system perspective. A novel evaluation model was developed by innovatively integrating the geographic information system (GIS) and system hybrid simulation consisting of system dynamics (SD), agent-based modeling (ABM) and discrete event simulation (DES). The proposed model was verified. Based on an empirical analysis of Shenzhen, China, it is found that the environmental impact of city-scale DWM is mainly concentrated in the central and northeastern regions of Shenzhen, demonstrating spatial heterogeneity and regional aggregation. Furthermore, the results reveal that the model is robust and effective to assess environmental impact from four aspects, i.e., land occupation, water pollution, air pollution and energy consumption.

Air pollutant concentrations often exhibit significant spatial and temporal variability, depending on local sources, climate conditions and the characteristics of the built and natural environment. The strong relationship between emissions and human activities is well known: residential functions, infrastructure systems and industrial plants are the main emission sources of different pollutants, especially for PM2.5. Agriculture also produces pollutants. By contrast, forests usually act as adsorption sinks, reducing the pollution concentration. Therefore, pollutant emissions and concentration patterns present significant spatial variability due to different land uses.

Specifically, Guangzhou's restructuring presents a pattern of suburban gentrification, coupled with sporadic inner-city gentrification. The city's spatial pattern of gentrification was shaped by the local state's spatial selectivity through land-driven development policies, such as administrative annexation, new-zone development, and urban renewal, which were intended to promote industrial upgrading and economic growth. While new-build gentrification was a key form of gentrification, the demographic changes in gentrified neighborhoods in Guangzhou were primarily attributed to the inflows of gentrifiers (especially those in knowledge-oriented or state sectors) instead of the physical displacement of disadvantaged groups.

Time-series urban land use (ULU) maps are vital for capturing dynamic land changes in the urbanization process, giving valuable insights into urban development and its environmental consequences. Recent studies have mapped ULU in some cities with a unified model, but ignored the regional differences among cities; and they generated ULU maps year by year, but ignored temporal correlations between years; thus, they could be weak in large-scale and long time-series ULU monitoring. Accordingly, we introduce an temporal-spatial-semantic collaborative (TSS) mapping framework to generating accurate ULU maps with considering regional differences and temporal correlations. Firstly, to support model training, a large-scale ULU sample dataset based on OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Sentinel-2 imagery is automatically constructed, providing a total number of 56,412 samples with a size of 512 x 512 which are divided into six sub-regions in China and used for training different classification models. Then, an urban land use mapping network (ULUNet) is proposed to recognize ULU. This model utilizes a primary and an auxiliary encoder to process noisy OSM samples and can enhance the model's robustness under noisy labels. Finally, taking the temporal correlations of ULU into consideration, the recognized ULU are optimized, whose boundaries are unified by a time-series co-segmentation, and whose categories are modified by a knowledge-data driven method. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we consider all urban areas in China (254,566 km2), and produce a time-series China urban land use dataset (CULU) at a 10-m resolution, spanning from 2016 to 2022, with an overall accuracy of CULU is 82.42%. Through comparison, it can be found that CULU outperforms existing datasets such as EULUC-China and UFZ-31cities in data accuracies, spatial boundaries consistencies and land use transitions logicality. The results indicate that the proposed method and generated dataset can play important roles in land use change monitoring, ecological-environmental evolution analysis, and also sustainable city development.",Urbanization,Land use,Time-series mapping,China urban land use dataset (CULU),CLIMATE-CHANGE,COVER,CLASSIFICATION,OPENSTREETMAP,IMAGERY,AREA,,,,,,,,,"Tan, Ge","Wang, Haoyu","Du, Shihong",,,,,,,,

In order to explore the interactive relationship between urban rail transit and spatial heat map, this study used Baidu heat map and rail transit station ridership data to analyze the coupling characteristics between network centrality, ridership and nearby spatial heat index of rail transit stations on a micro level, taking Shanghai as a case study. Firstly, it investigated the overall coupling relationship between two categories of station attributes and spatial heat through Pearson bivariate correlation analysis. Then, bivariate spatial autocorrelation and geographically weighted regression analysis methods were introduced to explore the spatial association patterns between network centrality and spatial heat, as well as between spatial heat and ridership, followed by a spatial differentiation comparison between the two coupling types. The results show that the coupling relationship between rail network centrality and spatial heat is obviously better than that between ridership and spatial heat at station level, since traffic location advantage can usually develop higher spatial heat, while ridership may be affected by more complex factors. Spatial heat map is more suitable for quantifying the interaction between rail transit and urban space in areas outside the urban core, where increasing rail network centrality has a multiplier effect on spatial heat improvement, but improving spatial heat in areas with low-density development is more conducive to stimulating ridership. It is feasible to evaluate the ridership potential of new stations outside the urban core area by using spatial heat map, but this data alone is not enough to predict ridership. The urban renewal around rail transit stations can be optimized by referring to the differences between the two types of coupling at different spatial locations. This study explored the analytical framework for improving the layout of rail transit network based on urban spatial heat map, and optimizing TOD (Transit-Oriented Development) stations for factors negatively affecting their coupling.

This further affects the water quality and the ability of the rivers to self-purification. A lot of planning and development is required to restore the water quality back to acceptable levels according to national and international standards. This paper describes a critical review on the research on the concept of river restoration for the urban rivers in North London, India and Italy whose waters are a measure of sustainability. These rivers have been polluted and their water quality has deteriorated due to urban development, which necessitates the re-revival and activation of the development potential of these rivers. River restoration is one of the latest concepts of urban rivers' sustainability, as it focuses on planning urban rivers, improving their function and water quality, and restoring them to support healthy and prosperous ecosystems, at various levels. This research will assess the current experiences in pollution treatment through various concepts and techniques in river restoration due to pollution. It will also highlight the strategies and techniques adopted in treating river pollution of the study area to ensure good water quality with the aim to restore the rivers as sustainable rivers. Where the focus will be on the rivers of the city of Basra (northern Iraq) as a study area because these rivers represent the identity of the city, which gave it the title (Venice of Arabs) previously. But at the present time, these rivers have deteriorated due to pollution and have turned into sewage swamps, which requires the development of strategies to restore them. The study concluded that the restoration process of Basra rivers can only be achieved through three concepts that must be applied successively: treating river pollution and improving water quality, restoring rivers, activating the development potential of rivers. Each of these concepts has strategies that must be followed to restore the natural and the aesthetic value of the rivers, and the renewal of society's relationship with nature.

However, the existing research into urban village regeneration does not pay enough attention to the group of rural migrants, and the dynamic process of their participation is indistinct. With a theoretical underpinning of the conception of Arrival City and Affordable City and the ladder theory of participation, this paper attempts to understand the practices of rural migrants' participation in urban village regeneration and, more importantly, to unpack the underlying mysteries of the transition process from arrival cities to affordable cities in China. The paper finds that rural migrants are involved in urban village regeneration indirectly, as opposed to directly or not participating at all. Before a regeneration project take places, they are expelled and ostracised by the alliance of ""government-developer-villager"" because of their informal identities. After the project, middle-class migrants lived in the regenerated urban villages but suffered from social exclusion. Most of the migrants gather in the newer urban villages or form new arrival cities in the urban periphery, resulting in potential social conflicts and a vicious cycle of ""regeneration - migration - regeneration - migra-tion"". The vision is realised only in the environment and discourses from the alliance, but not in terms of rural migrants. China's urban transition from arrival cities to affordable cities is incomplete and one-sided. This transition, guided as it is by the existing mechanism of urban village regeneration, undermines social equity and causes social conflicts, which is not sustainable.

Researchers conducted two surveys of service coordinators who worked with older residents of US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) multifamily properties in mid-2020 and late-2021. These residents experienced many pandemic-related disruptions to their support systems, and findings revealed ways that service coordinators assessed resident need, linked them to public benefits programs, improved their access to technology, translated public health responses, and facilitated access to partner organizations and professional supports. Through assessment and communication, and decision-management and problem solving, service coordinator work increased the efficiency and effectiveness of external supports available to help meet residents' needs for food, medicine, supplies, personal care, and mental and physical healthcare. With an aging population and an increasing rate of unpredictable weather events, service coordination, which is inconsistently funded and is not mandated for HUD properties, may offer an opportunity to improve the adaptability and resilience of older supported housing residents.",Housing,older adults,HUD,service coordinator,COVID-19,HEALTH-STATUS,MANAGEMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following an outline of the main philosophical arguments of republican freedom, which emphasises the link between freedom and non-domination, the paper focuses on the cases of Alevis and Roma-Gypsy populations in Turkey, as two different minority groups that face a unique set of identity problems. The debate on the nature of the discriminatory treatment of certain ethnoreligious groups in Turkey tries, on the one hand, to demonstrate the republican conception's promise to uncover difficulties relating to the status of freedoms. On the other hand, it seeks to highlight potential constraints, especially when it realises socio-economic rights.",Republican freedom as non-domination,Justice and Development Party,Alevis,Roma/Gypsy community,URBAN-RENEWAL,TRANSFORMATION,ISTANBUL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the estimation of urban CO2 emissions by night light data, this study used spatial autocorrelation, spatial Markov chain and geographically weighted regression model to measure the spatial correlation and spillover effects of the coupling coordination degree of two systems in the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration from 2005 to 2018 and analyzed the influencing factors. The results showed that (1) the coupling coordination degree showed an increasing trend, but the club effect was quite obvious, and the regional pattern was higher in southeast and lower in northwest; (2) the spatial spillover effect of coupling coordination degree is significant, which aggravates the long-term persistence of the imbalance pattern; (3) regional economic level, government fiscal regulation, and industrial upgrading are the main driving forces for the increase of coupling coordination degree, while over-concentration of population and low energy efficiency are the main obstacles. Finally, on the basis of these conclusions, we provide targeted policy planning suggestions for policy makers.",Yangtze River Delta (YRD),Low carbon development,New-type urbanization,Nighttime light data,Coupling coordination degree (CCD),Geographically weighted regression (GWR),DIOXIDE EMISSIONS,ENERGY-CONSUMPTION,CO2 EMISSIONS,SCENARIO ANALYSIS,URBAN AREAS,CHINA,IMPACT,POPULATION,LEVEL,CITY,,,"Zhao, Kuokuo","Du, Zhinian","Han, Kaiqiang",,,,,,,,

Through a case study of the Kwun Tong Town Centre (KTTC) project, this research investigates whether redevelopment led by the Urban Renewal Authority (URA) in Hong Kong constitutes a form of state-led gentrification. Against the notion of generic gentrification, we argue that an urban process becomes gentrification only when the conceptual assumptions are consistent with contextual realities. Through a literature review, two core assumptions about state-led gentrification were identified: 1) the redevelopment is capital-led and against the community's will, and 2) the logic of capital has overridden the logic of the government during the redevelopment. Despite the appearance of state-led gentrification, the KTTC redevelopment was a state-led while socially-oriented process supported by the local community. This project was undertaken to redress environmental deterioration and building obsolesce in a crowded and old urban area. Government-led planning was necessary because the project required government land, proactive planning, and public subsidies. Local support was conditioned on a societal consensus on the policy governing acquisition and compensation. The scheme design reflected a commitment to social goals and community aspiration. The URA endeavoured to address residents' housing needs by directly engaging residents in the acquisition process. The authority leveraged private-sector capital to take forward redevelopment, but retained control over the project through a plan-led approach and a profit-sharing formula. The negative outcomes of displacement were mitigated by the authority and other contextual factors. The government's ongoing commitment to public housing limited the chance of area-wide gentrification. Whilst not negating the problem of displacement, this article advocates for a grounded perspective to understand the cause and effect of a gentrification-like process. It further calls for research on similar projects to support the development of generalisable counter-gentrification agendas.",Gentrification,State-led gentrification,Displacement,Urban redevelopment,Hong Kong,Comparative urbanism,GLOBAL CITY,DISPLACEMENT,SEGREGATION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared with other areas, commerce, business, and public service elements such as culture, medical care, and education are more concentrated than non-station areas, and they are more likely to face the problem of unbalanced development of transportation and land use. The five new towns are the main carriers of the rapid spatial growth of Shanghai. It is useful to find out the problems existing in each station area by measuring the coordinated development level between public transportation and land use in these areas in new towns. And it is also beneficial to put forward improvement measures in the station area and optimize the urban spatial structure. Based on the node-place model, this study takes the metro stations in the five new towns in Shanghai as the research object and constructs a coordinated evaluation index to measure the coordinated development level of rail transit and land use. According to the measurement results, the research stations are divided into four categories: the new town center, community, suburban, and edge type. For each type, the crux of the problem is analyzed and optimization suggestions are provided. The evaluation results may also assist in the guidance for the renewal and construction of the new towns.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The research scale was zoned with environmental functional regions, where land management policies were formulated. A case study in Anji County successfully demonstrated the applica-tion of the ESP-MS-PLUS model. First, we constructed three different levels of ESPs as ecological constraints by utiliz-ing ecosystem services evaluation and circuit theory. Second, four scenarios of land use and land cover changes (LUCCs) in 2034 were assumed, namely business as usual (BAU), priority given to urban development (PUD), priority given to ecological protection (PEP), and balanced urban development and ecological protection (BUE). Then, the basic ecological constraints (ecological red line areas and waters) and three types of ESPs were coupled with the four scenarios. The results of the simulation and analysis of landscape metrics under each scenario showed that the PEP and BUE scenarios would effectively reduce the degree and speed of ecological destruction. In addition, there were three environmental functional areas that could be used as priority areas for urban construction to ensure economic development. This study provides a new mechanism for land use optimization in the context of ecological protection at scales conducive to practice.",Urban expansion,Land use optimization,Multi-scenario simulation,Ecological security pattern,PLUS model,URBAN-GROWTH SIMULATION,REMOTE-SENSING DATA,ECOSYSTEM SERVICES,LANDSCAPE PATTERN,CELLULAR-AUTOMATA,CIRCUIT-THEORY,SPATIOTEMPORAL CHANGES,INTEGRATED MODEL,FLUS MODEL,EXPANSION,,,,"Shi, Yan","Liu, Bintao","Wu, Renwu","Lin, Wei","Pei, Hui","Bao, Zhiyi",,,,,

However, the current research primarily concentrates on the internal environment of the store and customer satisfaction, while the impact of some environmental features of the outer space of the business district on visitors is seldom systematically discussed. This study takes four commercial districts in Shenzhen as examples, and the streets were categorized into five types based on street characteristics using the cluster analysis method. The relationship between each type of street and the population distribution in the region was subsequently discussed. To this end, a holistic approach was adopted, integrating multi-source urban data such as street view panorama, points of interest (POI), and street and building vectors to describe the built environment. Furthermore, the distribution of people at different times, based on location-based services (LBS) data, was combined to establish statistical models of various streets in commercial districts and evaluate the relationship between street characteristics and human activities. The results demonstrate that the relationship between population distribution and spatial characteristics is different in the five types of streets. Different types of streets have their own advantages, and human activities in the business district are often not affected by this advantage, but by other characteristics. The impact of these factors varies significantly between weekdays and weekends. By systematically categorizing street types and assessing the impact of environmental factors on pedestrian flow, this study sheds new light on the renewal and development of urban commercial districts in the future.",Built environment,human activity,commercial area,cluster analysis,multi-source urban data,TRAVEL,ATTRACTIVENESS,ENVIRONMENT,PEDESTRIANS,SEOUL,MALL,,,,,,,,"Lo, Siu Ming","Lo, Jacqueline T.
