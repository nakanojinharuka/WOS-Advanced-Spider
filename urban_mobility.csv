However, human mobility has usually been defined narrowly in prior research that limits the understanding of its values for urban applications. The aim of this study is to reveal the complexity and multiplicity of human mobility concept for various urban application scenarios, and present a comprehensive review of mobility-driven urban studies through four re-conceptualized urban mobility perspectives. Using a systematic review approach, existing mobility-driven urban studies are classified based on whether they interpret urban mobility as spatial movements, a social phenomenon, an economic indicator or a policy tool. Then, the core values of knowledge about urban mobility for addressing contemporary urban challenges are analyzed, and the current trends and future directions of mobility-driven urban studies are also discussed. Moving forward, the application of urban mobility knowledge can be further advanced by the evolution of mobility concepts, the improvement of mobility data quality and the innovation of mobility analytical methods. This review can contribute to the understanding the state of the art of mobility-driven urban studies, and provide inspiration and guidelines for studies of this area in the future.",Mobility,Conceptualization,Big geodata,Urban issue,Urban application,Review,LAND-USE CLASSIFICATION,HUMAN ACTIVITY SPACES,AIR-POLLUTION,GPS DATA,BIG DATA,SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS,TRAFFIC PREDICTION,TOURISM RESEARCH,TRAVEL PATTERNS,LOCATION DATA,,,,,,,,,,

This criticism inspired an alternative, sustainable mobility-centred urban mobility planning paradigm, which has been attempting to shift to a different pathway for the past 30 years. While the outcome of this struggle is still undecided, an even more fundamental shift seems to be taking place on the ground. An urban mobility planning paradigm altogether beyond mobility seems to be emerging, centred not on facilitating or even managing mobility but rather on cultivating a broad set of highly diverse urban qualities. This discussion, forward-looking paper explores this apparent development, its potentials and its challenges. It first reviews the multiple, diverse reasons for shifting away from mobility-centred urban mobility planning. Second, it highlights what might be the emerging components of an urban mobility planning paradigm beyond mobility.

Scaling laws are basic but effective rules for evaluating a city's internal growth logic and assessing its efficiency by investigating whether urban indicators scale with population. To date, only limited research has empirically explored the scaling relations between variables of urban mobility in mega-cities at an intra-urban scale of a few meters. Using multiple urban-sensed and human-sensed data, this study proposes a thorough framework for quantifying the scaling laws in a city. To begin, urban mobility networks are built by aggregating population flows using large-scale mobile phone tracking data. To demonstrate the spatiotemporal variability of urban mobility, various network-based mobility measures are proposed. Following that, three different features of urban mobility laws are exposed, explaining spatial agglomeration, spatial hierarchical structures, and the temporal growth process. The scaling correlations between urban indicators pertaining to socioeconomic features and infrastructure and a mobility-population measure are then quantified using multi-sourced urban-sensed data. Applying this framework to the case study of Shenzhen, China revealed (a) spatial travel heterogeneity, hierarchical spatial structures, and mobility growth, and (b) not only a robust sub-linear relationship between infrastructure volume and population, but also a sub-linear relationship for socioeconomic activity. The identified scaling laws, both in terms of mobility measures and urban indicators, provide a multi-faceted portrait of the spatio-temporal variations of urban settings, allowing us to better understand intra-urban developments and, consequently, provide critical policy evaluations and suggestions for improving intra-urban efficiency in the future.",Scaling law,urban scaling,urban mobility,intra-urban system,mobile phone data,SCALING LAWS,TRIP FREQUENCY,PHONE,TRAJECTORIES,SHENZHEN,SIZE,LIFE,CITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding urban mobility patterns are significant for revealing actual living districts and planning efficient transportation systems and infrastructure. This study aims to detect urban communities with spatially strong interaction based on similar mobility patterns. To extract homogeneous urban communities, we utilize a network community detection method, focusing on the multimodal transfer travels of the public transport system. As a case study, we examined urban communities in the Seoul metropolitan area of South Korea. The results showed newly detected living communities based on the actual mobility patterns of urban populations including multiple-choice behavior of transport mode.

This study introduces a novel mobility measure - the Local Mobility Index (LMI) - combining geometry-based mobility metrics and accessibility measures. The LMI can be considered a measure of 'relative localness' by integrating preferences into the assessment of local mobility patterns, offering a novel measure for understanding mobility behavior in urban contexts. The LMI improves upon existing measures as it captures individual choice for local destinations through measuring whether individuals select nearby destinations; accounting for the unequal spatial distribution of urban amenities. Our contribution is mainly methodological, advancing the field by introducing a metric that captures different aspects of mobility compared to conventional mobility metrics. Leveraging mobile-phone-based GPS data, we examine the LMI using 759 individuals across three cities in England. We found that the LMI captures a new and distinct dimension of urban mobility, as evidenced by its weak correlation with established metrics. Therefore, LMI's capacity to highlight previously undetected aspects of mobility behavior, underscores its importance for advancing research and urban planning.",Local mobility index,localized travel behavior,urban accessibility optimization,spatial mobility patterns,HEALTH-CARE,ACCESSIBILITY,NEIGHBORHOODS,OPENSTREETMAP,WASHINGTON,AMENITIES,BEHAVIOR,MODEL,IMAGE,WORK,,,,,,,,,,,,

This imperative is exacerbated by the observation that improvements, by data analytics, in one segment of urban mobility typically have unintended and often adverse consequences in other segments.

Physical facilities are constantly improving, but mobility disadvantaged pedestrian satisfaction is not commensurate with it. Therefore, local government should consider other requirements as well as improving the installation of mobility convenience facilities. This study paid attention to the opinion in urban planning that compact cities are walkable cities and examined whether the urban form, a regional characteristic, affects the pedestrian satisfaction of the mobility disadvantaged persons. In order to investigate the relationship between urban form and pedestrian satisfaction, hierarchical linear models were performed using the HLM program. The urban form was measured by land cover in the city using GIS and Fragstats. The results of analyses (Model 1 & SIM;4) showed that the urban form used as a variable at the regional level can explain 22-26% (variance) of the walking satisfaction. In addition, the mobility disadvantaged and sprawl urban form showed (-) in pedestrian satisfaction. The more sprawl, the opposite of compactness, the lower the satisfaction of the mobility disadvantaged person.

Urban development yields intertwining and interdependent functional areas for residence, commerce, and education, which leads to complex but regular population mobility patterns. Population mobility spaces can effectively represent the actual service scopes of urban functions. Therefore, in this study, we propose a function-associated population mobility network (FPMN) to dynamically delineate the service capacities of urban functions, and to quantify the driving effects of urban functions on population mobility under spatial interaction conditions. By integrating the cumulative opportunities of geographic nodes with the potential opportunities reflected by population mobility, k-step function accessibility with population mobility (k-step PFA) is defined in FPMN to characterize the accessibility relationships between geographic nodes and function nodes. Based on k-step PFA, considering the complementarity and intervention opportunities, the function-driven index (FDI) is proposed to quantify the driving effects of urban functions on population mobility. Our experimental results indicated that FPMN could effectively represent the actual service scopes and capabilities of urban functions. Compared with general location-based accessibility indicators, k-step PFA has a higher numerical distribution and less spatial disparity, and it aligns more closely with the actual service scopes of urban functions. In addition, compared with intervening opportunities models, FDI delineates the functional driving effects of population mobility with greater precision, as well as revealing the travel propensity traits of a population relative to various urban functions through propensity parameters.",Urban function,Population mobility network,Accessibility,Transferability,Complementarity,Intervention opportunities,PATTERNS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A number of initiatives were taken through smart mobility or TOD projects to ensure smart urban living over time. However, there is a lack of consistent approach to combining smart mobility and TOD for smart urban living. The connection between TOD and smart mobility performance indicators remains unexplored for smart urban living. Therefore, the study aim was to develop a conceptual framework for eco-friendly smart urban living with the integration of TOD and smart mobility performance indicators. A compendious literature search was conducted to identify the smart mobility and TOD performance indicators. A Delphi questionnaire was also used to rank the indicators by experts. The eco-friendly smart urban living framework was developed with the integration of smart mobility and TOD performance indicators.

While important because such boundaries signal relevant policy environments, little research has tested these assumptions and, more broadly, the implications of examining mobility using an inter/intrastate classification schema versus other substantively-relevant approaches. Because these examinations have been particularly absent in developing nations, we compare the dynamics and correlates of mobility across inter/intrastate, distance- and rural/urban-based classification schemata in Mexico, a nation with heterogeneous mobility similar to other large middle-income countries and overall good data availability. We use 2000, 2010 and 2020 Census long-form data to examine the changing dynamics of mobility patterns and correlates across the classification schemata. While we find that interstate mobility does cover a large majority of long-distance and many urban-urban moves, we find that the correlates of interstate movement vary considerably from urban-urban movement in particular. We also find that excluding intrametropolitan from other types of moves may be a sensible strategy to better characterize some processes, an issue of increasing relevance in a more urban world and where city-regions span across major administrative areas. Given these findings, for a better understanding socioeconomic patterns and trends, we recommend that studies of internal migration avoid intra/interstate schema, consider separating intrametropolitan moves, and combine distance-based and rural-urban-metropolitan approaches.",distance,internal migration,metropolitan,Mexico,residential mobility,rural,spatial interaction models,spatial mobility,urban,LIFE-COURSE,MIGRATION,DISTANCE,URBAN,AFRICA,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bringing together scholarship on extreme weather and mobilities, it explores the differential impact of flooding on their everyday lives as they navigate the cities of Accra and Tamale. A range of qualitative methods were drawn on, including semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, and follow-along-participant observations in selected communities of both cities. Three key themes emerged: disrupted road and transport infrastructure, everyday mobility challenges, and coping/adaptive strategies. In flooding conditions, residents experienced difficulties leaving/returning home, engaging in income-generating activities, and accessing transport services and other key urban infrastructure. Conceptually, the paper reveals how disruption to urban residents' daily movements and activities (re)produces new forms of mobilities and immobilities, which have three relational elements: postponed, improvised and assisted. Throughout the analysis, we show how these mobilities/immobilities vary by age and gender: all urban residents, (though women in particular), experience postponed mobility; young people especially engage in improvised mobility; and children and the elderly are in greatest need of assisted mobility. The paper thus contributes to scholarship on extreme weather events and mobility by providing a more spatially nuanced understanding of the multi-faceted domains in which flooding, socio-economic conditions and adaptive strategies intersect to influence urban mobility in resource poor settings.",extreme weather,flooding,everyday mobility,Accra,Tamale,Ghana,CLIMATE-CHANGE,LIVELIHOODS,CITY,MIGRATION,LANDSLIDE,GENDER,YOUTH,LIVES,ACCRA,MEN,,,,,,,,,,

We then compare urban mobility options, including recently developed hybrid mobility and sharing schemes. Our results show that, although private means have an advantage in terms of personal practicality, they are not desirable from a degrowth perspective, due to their high social and environmental costs and as constituting a source of urban injustice. Public, hybrid, and self-propelled mobility options would become more practical if such injustices were recognised, and if effective public policies challenged the radical monopoly of cars. Further, hybrid options and sharing/pooling schemes have the potential to reduce the use of private means for metropolitan mobility.

In China, government policies, including economic reforms and targeted migration strategies, have resulted in the relocation of millions of people within and between urban and rural areas. Recently, however, there has been an important 'mobility shift' from the production-focused migration of peasants and factory workers to more diverse forms of consumption-focused mobility. This appears to be something different from traditional forms of tourism, but more research is needed. In particular, it is important to consider who these individuals are, what motivates them, and whether they are leaving the urban for the rural or constructing hybrid spaces, mobilities, and life-styles.

Distinguished from prior greenway research, this investigation emphasizes individual mobility and adds a novel perspective to greenway planning. The method was tested in the city of Mashhad in Iran.

The evaluation involves the validation of Twitter-derived mobility estimates at both temporal and spatial scales, employing over 1.6 x 1011 mobile phone records of around three million users during the non-stationary mobility period from April 2020 to. June 2022, which coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic. The results highlight the need for caution when using Twitter for short-term modeling of urban mobility flows. Short-term inference can be influenced by Twitter policy changes and the availability of publicly accessible tweets. On the other hand, this long-term study demonstrates that employing multiple mobility metrics simultaneously, analyzing dynamic and static mobility changes concurrently, and employing robust preprocessing techniques such as rolling window downsampling can enhance the inference capabilities of Twitter data. These novel insights gained from a long-term perspective are vital, as Twitter - rebranded to X in 2023 - is extensively used by researchers worldwide to infer human movement patterns.

Theoretically, the paper draws upon critical urban mobilities studies that invite interlinking carbon reduction, smart cities and mobility planning.

It is concluded that none of the plans of the 10 capitals studied require AVs to integrate with public means of transport or to be fuelled by renewable energy sources. Hence, AVs are likely to individualise and intensify the existing automobility regime further and emissions are likely to increase, according to the comparative urban analysis.

Then, we utilize the tensor decomposition method to conduct in-depth study on the intercity mobility pattern from the perspectives of complexity and multidimensionality. We construct a 4-D tensor based on private car trajectory and point-of-interest (POI) datasets and define the functional similarity and geographic adjacency between regions. Finally, we design an alternating proximal gradient (APG)-based method to resolve the core tensor and factor matrix, leading to the fine-grained discovery of intercity mobility patterns on administrative divisions in the urban agglomeration. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the analysis of intercity mobility, using a real-world dataset containing one-year private car trajectories from five cities in the selected urban agglomeration. The experiments show that the proposed method successfully captures 20 intercity mobility patterns, in which the factor matrices retrieve the patterns from different dimensions with core tensors characterizing correlations between patterns in factor matrices. Besides, the extracted intercity mobility patterns not only cover administrative areas with frequent intercity interactions, but also contain areas with less intercity interactions.

Methodologically, a mixed approach was deployed, based on the application of an urban accessibility index, semi-structured interviews and go along interviews on the daily mobility of residents of the city's housing neighbourhoods. The results show that the experience of mobility towards urban services is marked by a number of barriers related to socio-economic status and gender, which the residents do not face in identical ways.

While the literature on food delivery platforms centres on changing labour relations, platform workers do not merely represent a new type of labour; they likewise form a critical conduit in the urban logistics system. Platform-mediated food delivery can be therefore conceptualised as a moving assemblage of heterogeneous entities that constitutes an urban infrastructure. Having emerged as an urban mobility regime, food delivery platforms increasingly enact a form of governance, enabling a particular mode of circulation and movements. Engaging with the mobility framework, combined with critical infrastructure scholarship, this paper seeks to uncover the politics of im/mobility involved in the creation of a ceaselessly flowing city envisaged by Baemin.

As urbanization has slowed down in most megacities, improved urban growth modeling with minor changes has become a crucial open issue for these cities. Most existing models are based on stationary factors and spatial proximity, which are unlikely to depict spatial connectivity between regions. This research attempts to leverage the power of real-world human mobility and consider intra-city spatial interaction as an imperative driver in the context of urban growth simulation. Specifically, the gravity model, which considers both the scale and distance effects of geographical locations within cities, is employed to characterize the connection between land areas using individual trajectory data from a macro perspective. It then becomes possible to integrate human mobility factors into a neural-network-based cellular automata (ANN-CA) for urban growth modeling in Beijing from 2013 to 2016. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms traditional models in terms of the overall accuracy with a 0.60% improvement in Cohen's Kappa coefficient and a 0.41% improvement in the figure of merit. In addition, the improvements are even more significant in districts with strong relationships with the central area of Beijing. For example, we find that the Kappa coefficients in three districts (Chaoyang, Daxing, and Shunyi) are considerably higher by more than 2.00%, suggesting the possible existence of a positive link between intense human interaction and urban growth.

In this work, the taxi trajectory data of Chengdu and New York City is processed, and the corresponding urban trip networks are constructed based on geographic information systems. We empirically and systematically analyze these urban trip networks according to the network hierarchy based on complex network theory. First, we studied the low-order organization of the urban trip networks (i.e., degree distribution, cluster-degree coefficient, rich-club coefficient, and so on.). We uncover the nontrivial relationship between network density and trip distance and find that the urban trip network in Chengdu is more heterogeneous than that in New York City. Second, we investigate the meso-order organization of the urban trip networks by using community detection. The community detection results show that the community boundaries are more or less mismatched with the administrative boundaries. Finally, we detect the higher-order organizations of the urban trip networks and find some critical nodes and regions.

However, given the fact mobile phone data are not available everywhere and are generally difficult to access and share, mostly because of commercial restrictions and privacy concerns, more readily available data with global coverage, such as night-time light (NTL) imagery, have been alternatively used as a proxy for population density changes due to population movements. This study further explores the potential to use NTL brightness as a short-term mobility metric by analysing the relationship between NTL and smartphone-based Google Aggregated Mobility Research Dataset (GAMRD) data across twelve African countries over two periods: 2018-2019 and 2020. The data were stratified by a measure of the degree of urbanisation, whereby the administrative units of each country were assigned to one of eight classes ranging from low-density rural to high-density urban. Results from the correlation analysis, between the NTL Sum of Lights (SoL) radiance values and three different GAMRD-based flow metrics calculated at the administrative unit level, showed significant differences in NTL-GAMRD correlation values across the eight rural/urban classes. The highest correlations were typically found in predominantly rural areas, suggesting that the use of NTL data as a mobility metric may be less reliable in predominantly urban settings. This is likely due to the brightness saturation and higher brightness stability within the latter, showing less of an effect than in rural or peri-urban areas of changes in brightness due to people leaving or arriving. Human mobility in 2020 (during COVID-19-related restrictions) was observed to be significantly different than in 2018-2019, resulting in a reduced NTL-GAMRD correlation strength, especially in urban settings, most probably because of the monthly NTL SoL radiance values remaining relatively similar in 2018-2019 and 2020 and the human mobility, especially in urban settings, significantly decreasing in 2020 with respect to the previous considered period. The use of NTL data on its own to assess monthly mobility and the associated fluctuations in population density was therefore shown to be promising in rural and peri-urban areas but problematic in urban settings.",night-time lights,Google Aggregated Mobility Research Dataset,human mobility,Africa,rural and urban classification,NIGHTTIME,MEASLES,IMPACT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, digital platforms, as well as their failures, affect daily mobilities in contradictory ways. On the one hand, digital platforms mediate and reshape the timespace of people's daily mobilities and make people adjust and adapt their practices to the logic of platforms.

To calculate the least-cost paths and safer, more efficient routes, it is necessary to understand the geometry of streets and their various elements accurately. In this study, we propose a semi-automatic methodology to assess the capacity of urban spaces to enable adequate pedestrian mobility. We employ various data sources, but primarily point clouds obtained through a mobile laser scanner (MLS), which provide a wealth of highly detailed information about the geometry of street elements. Our method allows us to characterize preferred pedestrian-traffic zones by segmenting crosswalks, delineating sidewalks, and identifying obstacles and impediments to walking in urban routes. Subsequently, we generate different displacement cost surfaces and identify the least-cost origin-destination paths. All these factors enable a detailed pedestrian mobility analysis, yielding results on a raster with a ground sampling distance (GSD) of 10 cm/pix. The method is validated through its application in a case study analyzing pedestrian mobility around an educational center in a purely urban area of A Coruna (Galicia, Spain). The segmentation model successfully identified all pedestrian crossings in the study area without false positives. Additionally, obstacle segmentation effectively identified urban elements and parked vehicles, providing crucial information to generate precise friction surfaces reflecting real environmental conditions. Furthermore, the generation of cumulative displacement cost surfaces allowed for identifying optimal routes for pedestrian movement, considering the presence of obstacles and the availability of traversable spaces. These surfaces provided a detailed representation of pedestrian mobility, highlighting significant variations in travel times, especially in areas with high obstacle density, where differences of up to 15% were observed. These results underscore the importance of considering obstacles' existence and location when planning pedestrian routes, which can significantly influence travel times and route selection. We consider the capability to generate accurate cumulative cost surfaces to be a significant advantage, as it enables urban planners and local authorities to make informed decisions regarding the improvement of pedestrian infrastructure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As China's transportation infrastructure continues to grow, more research is needed to analyse the spatial patterns of travel flows and to understand how these patterns change over time. With the development of online car-hailing and ride sharing services, floating car data have become a new resource to facilitate the analysis of human mobility patterns and the interactions of urban mobility within a city. The detection of urban communities based on urban networks is a helpful way to represent urban interactions. However, understanding community changes using online car-hailing data remains an underexplored topic. To this end, this study applies a community detection method to explore community changes over time based on the newly available floating car data (DiDi Chuxing ('DiDi')) in Chengdu, China. We applied undirected graphs to examine the spatial distribution of DiDi usage and the spatial patterns of travel distance. In addition, we explored the spatial-temporal variations of the communities at the taxi zone level using Blondel's iterative algorithm, a modularity optimization approach. Results suggest that: 1) taxi zones on the south and west sides of Chengdu have more average daily trips compared to those in other areas; 2) residential taxi zones in the northeast area have a long median travel distance, indicating people living in those areas travel longer distances; and 3) the detected community structures change at different times.

In developing countries such as India, urban floods have severe impacts due to highly vulnerable population density. The normal functioning of the urban region is disrupted due to the effect of floods on the urban road network. This paper examined vehicular mobility on urban road networks under nonflood and flood conditions and identified an affected region under the flood condition. Multiple centrality assessment (MCA) was used with multiple classical metrics, such as betweenness centrality and closeness centrality, to assess the status of nodes using distance and travel time under nonflood and flood conditions. The road network under floods was generated by the Soil Conservation Service curve number (SCS-CN) and time area histogram methods using flooding depth over road network and betweenness centrality. Weighted overlay centrality layers were created to identify the regions with severely affected mobility under the flood condition by generating a ward-level vulnerability map. The Pearson's correlation analysis of centrality maps showed that network centrality is correlated strongly with the road network availability at a 95% confidence level. The study also indicates that under flood condition, high betweenness centrality decreases at the city center and closeness centrality exhibits contrasting spatial patterns. According to the ward-level vulnerability map, mobility on road networks was affected severely in 29.35% of the areas, most of which were centrally located. This research suggests that during urban planning, major roads that have greater impedance during floods should be distributed throughout the region so that mobility is less affected by floods.

Among other effects, autonomous vehicles may affect morpho-functional patterns of urban development and, especially, may reinforce or reduce dispersed development patterns, which have been relevant in many cities, particularly in the last decades. In order to offer an assessment of these possible effects, we propose a new urban sprawl index to measure the degree of dispersion/concentration of settlements in the medium-sized urban area of a Spanish city (Santander, Cantabria). Further, we explain the distribution of this index by means of a regression model, showing that variables such as average household income, trip time to the main urban centre, or the percentage of people using cars to commute to work are relevant factors that correlate positively with urban sprawl. Finally, we apply the proposed model to different scenarios to examine how the development of autonomous mobility could affect the characteristics of the analysed settlements. The results obtained suggest that, in scenarios with higher car usage and longer trip times to the urban centre because of the larger number of circulating vehicles, the form of urban settlements, especially those at an intermediate distance from the urban core, could experience an increase in sprawl.

To assess the association between daily exposure to urban green space, we used home address and time-activity data collected from 1911 participants in western New York, US, using their GPS-enabled mobile phones. We abstracted both individuals' home address based (home-based) and daily time activity based (mobility-based) green space exposures from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).

Anthropogenic heat release factors have contributed to local temperature increases in cities. However, existing studies have mainly focused on the static sector of anthropogenic heat release factors. Therefore, this study addresses the effects of urban spatial temperatures considering anthropogenic heat release factors, with a focus on the mobility sector. An average summer temperature (avS) estimating model was developed with deep neural network (DNN) and random forest (RF) in detailed spatial units within a city (1 km spatial resolution) using eight mobility sector and four static sector indicators as input variables. The feasibility of introducing mobility indicators was verified by performing a correlation analysis between temperature and traffic flows. Mobility exhibited a higher correlation with the climate sector than with static road indicators. The RF model with mobility indicators effectively estimated spatial distribution of air temperatures, with an RMSE of 0.0777 and R2 of 0.9121, and outperformed the DNN model.

Thereby I draw attention to how platform transportation workers in Mumbai, India, produce mobility services by collaboratively linking the social and material resources of the city. Networks and communities of transport workers have long been essential for providing intermediate mobility services in Mumbai, and continue to do so in the platform era. Building on these observations, I inquire whether there is potential for the creation of worker-centric platform models that benefit both the workers and the larger urban majority. Therefore, drawing on my fieldwork in Mumbai, I first explore how the current model of digital mobility platforms in Mumbai reinforces socio-spatial fragmentation in Mumbai while leaving workers with decreasing earnings and rising work pressure. Considering the agency of platform workers, I then aim to uncover how platform workers appropriate platform mechanisms and engage their collective knowledge and experiences in order to improve their working situation.

Based on a macro perspective of temporal and spatial evolution, this study analyzes the historical logics of rural-urban governance, explores the geographical patterns of challenges in China's rural-urban governance, and finally puts forward targeted strategies for rural-urban governance toward integrated and sustainable development in China. From the historical perspective, the urban originates from the rural, and the connotation of rural, that is, a regional-scale outlook, rural-urban relations, and sociocultural interaction, forms the traditional approach to rural-urban governance. China's rural-urban governance has evolved from antagonism toward integration. In terms of theoretical development, the turn toward mobility is an important driving factor shaping and promoting the transformation of research focus on rural-urban governance. The mobility of urban and rural factors has especially in recent decades brought extensive challenges for governance, which are highlighted by the disintegration of the stability of rural and urban structures, growing regional disparities in rural education levels, and serious aging and hollowing crises in rural areas. We therefore propose that rural-urban governance should give sufficient consideration to the convergence of wider interests; realize social potential through institutional, cultural and spatial restructuring; and attach importance to collaborative development and governance. And the transfer of rural problems to urban areas should be paid attention to by rural-urban governance. This research enriches the knowledge regarding the logics and patterns of China's rural-urban governance from an interdisciplinary perspective.

In particular, we note how the huge expansion in mobility choices made possible by CAVs might lead to circumstances in which the outcome of individuals exercising that choice is to change the nature of urban mobility profoundly.

This article remedies the gap through the concept of spatial justice. Initially asserting the 'right to' urban space, spatial justice has been recently re-thought at a regional scale, and is an emerging interpretation of rural marginalization and redress. As a normative concept, however, spatial justice risks simplistically measuring the distribution and presuming sedentarism. By applying spatial justice to lifestyle mobilities pre-pandemic and looking ahead to future shifts, we offer a nuanced, relational perspective on the theory and the field. Through qualitative case studies from rural and peripheral regions in Wales and Ireland, we show how inequalities and mobilities are complex and inter-related, with significant implications for regional sustainability, cohesion and identity.

By capitalising on high spatio-temporal resolution data provided by Spectus.ai, this study aims at investigating how the deprivation level of the area where people live influences the kinds of urban environment they are more likely to use for their everyday activities. To do this, raw GPS trajectories collected in 2019 in Great Britain (GB) are transformed into semantic trajectories where short-time changes and the functional nature of urban contexts are acknowledged as two key dimensions to understand human spatial behaviours. Hourly sequences of stops are extracted from GPS trajectories and enriched with contextual information based on a new area-based classification detecting urban functions. The data exploration shows that some human patterns are widely common across all levels of deprivation, such as the tendency to be mostly exposed to the urban context near the home location. At the same time, we show that differences exist, especially between those who live in the most deprived areas and those who live in the least deprived areas of GB. It appears that people living in the most deprived areas tend to have a less regular working pattern and be more exposed to urban-based functions and well-served areas, while those living in the least deprived areas have a more regular working patterns and are mostly exposed to the countryside and low-density areas.

At destination, however, insufficient information is available on the complex mobility backgrounds of the new arrivals. We employ a mixed methods approach to investigate mobility patterns to Pune, India, with a special focus on the role of droughts. Combining a household survey with in-depth interviews and monthly precipitation data on district level, we use descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis to show a significant relationship between drought at origin and mobility to Pune. Particularly affected are recent arrivals, migrants of rural origin and from other states, and those currently living in informal areas. The link between droughts and mobility decisions is usually indirect, hidden behind economic conditions such as the loss of agricultural jobs. Paradoxically, migrants affected by droughts at origin face increased flood risk at destination. This risk, however, is often consciously taken in favor of better livelihood opportunities in the city.

Four scenarios with varying urban centers and street network classifications are developed: a ""do-nothing"" scenario and three backcasting scenarios prioritizing sustainable mobility. The method considers factors such as street width, land uses, current classification, public transport and cycling routes, street continuity, and the quality of the urban environment. A two-dimensional matrix (street significance vs. mode priority) is employed to develop new street categories in the backcasting scenarios, with geospatial and network analysis playing a crucial role. These scenarios are then evaluated using multicriteria analysis (REGIME method), incorporating various urban and transportation criteria. Applied to Kallithea in Athens, Greece, the results show that scenarios proposing new urban centers and readable street classification with traffic calming zones are more efficient. Additionally, they cultivate better conditions for sustainable transportation. This novel method provides valuable insights for policymakers and planners, while contributing to the scientific debate on sustainable mobility planning.",Street classification,Traffic calming areas,Multicriteria analysis,Scenario planning,Spatial analysis,Sustainable mobility,MULTICRITERIA DECISION-ANALYSIS,ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS,TRANSPORT,NETWORKS,VEHICLES,MOBILITY,IMPACTS,SELECTION,PROJECTS,DESIGN,,,,,,,,,,

Although city administrations in some countries, partially as a response to the Covid-19 pandemic, have adopted short or long-term plans for reassignment of vehicular space in favour of cyclist and pedestrian infrastructures, traditional approaches to urban planning, tend to overlook urban users in terms of their individual characteristics, which can significantly impact their perceptions of level of walkability for public spaces. Women in particular face harassment, aggression and other safety concerns that can inhibit their mobility in public spaces, especially at night. Despite robust research on other aspects of walkability in cities, there is a lack of knowledge at the intersection between mobility and gender. Addressing the need for further investment in qualitative, and particularly in quantitative analysis, the current contributions proposes and reports on the use of GIS-based methodology, with data collected directly from women in urban contexts, and other open-access location-based data, producing analyses that can support decision-makers concerning policy for walkability in urban environments.

Most human mobility studies relying on aggregate flow data inevitably neglect the heterogeneity of disaggregate travel patterns with distinctive spatiotemporal characteristics, causing the uncertainty problem for identifying meaningful travel behaviors. Moreover, there is a lack of robust methodological approaches to extracting stable and genuine travel patterns under normal or disruptive situations. To address these issues, this study proposes a data-driven approach to spatiotemporal flow decomposition based on non-negative matrix factorization. With sparseness factored in the decomposition, stable disaggregate travel patterns can be extracted from origin-destination mobility flows. By combining temporal, spatial, and urban functional perspectives, heterogeneous travel behaviors can be analyzed and inferred. With a case study of the Zhengzhou '7.20' heavy rainfall in 2021, the most extreme rainfall ever recorded in China, this study validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach and managed to identify representative and interesting travel patterns and behaviors, facilitating a better understanding of human travel behaviors under external impacts.

Previous studies on dominant mobility models (i.e., gravity and radiation models) rarely describe the refined spatiotemporal process of human mobility flow forces especially within city. To address this gap, this paper proposes a spatiotemporal flow force model (FFM) of sink/source human mobilities within city, which is derived from Navier-Stokes equation in the field of fluid mechanics. The FFM model outperforms the gravity and radiation models in modeling the refined spatiotemporal flow force process of source/sink human mobilities, in the aspect of intensity and direction of mobility flow force. Comparison results show that the gravity and radiation models in the source mobility scenario can give a rough force estimation about the total outflow from source mobility areas while without the capability of explaining the specific directions of mobility flow from source mobility areas. Pearson correlation coefficient between the intensity results of the two models and those of FFM range from 0.65 to 0.90 and direction differences between the results of the two models and FFM respectively show no clear regularity. In the sink mobility scenario, the direction of mobility flows can be estimated well by the gravity and radiation models while the intensity of mobility flow between small-scale areas within cities is susceptible to inaccuracies. Pearson correlation coefficient ranges from 0.13 to 0.59 and direction differences follow a stepped distribution from high to low within the range of 0 degrees to 180 degrees. In addition, the potential field of human mobility flow force provides a powerful tool for visually analyzing mobility flows within cities.

Bike mobility can not only reflect human mobility patterns but also provide practical insights for understanding the bike-sharing system and assisting bike management. In partic-ular, continuous bike movement information can provide abundant spatiotemporal connection information for spatial context analysis in data without user ID information. This paper studies bike mobility by shifting the perspective from OD analysis to the new analysis primitive of bike mobility chain (BMC). First, bike-sharing OD trip data are reconstructed to obtain BMCs. Second, the reconstructed BMCs are feature-augmented, based on which the spatiotemporal characteristics of bike mobility are analyzed. Finally, the word embedding model and the clustering algorithm are applied to the BMCs, which embody rich spatiotemporal inter-station connectivity, to facilitate mining stations with similar bike mobility. The methodology is applied for the comparative study of bike-sharing activities on workdays and holidays using data collected from New York Citi-Bike. The experimental results manifest locality patterns of bike mobility in both mobility chain indicators and multi-scale station embedding analysis results, and reveal disparities in BMC statistic indicators and spatial distribution mode of stations with similar bike mobility.

For years, many studies have been dedicated to developing various models to predict human movement; however, abnormal human flows caused by large-scale urban disasters, such as urban floods, remain difficult to capture accurately using existing models. In this paper, we propose a spatiotemporal hybrid deep learning model based on a graph convolutional network and long short-term memory with a spatial heterogeneity component. Using 1.32 billion movement records from smartphone users, we applied the model to predict total hourly flows of human mobility in the ""7.20"" extreme urban flood in Zhengzhou, China. We found that the proposed model can significantly improve the prediction accuracy (i.e., R2 from 0.887 to 0.951) for during-disaster flows while maintaining high accuracy for before- and after-disaster flows.

However, pedestrians are often not considered when analyzing mobility patterns. Urban projects tend to focus on mass transport and urban infrastructure, creating urban barriers and penalizing the pedestrian mode. This article develops a method for assessing the impact of urban design on pedestrian travel. To do so, it proposes to evaluate the interaction between urban form and pedestrian mobility through two concepts: the ""urban barrier"", understood as an obstacle that affects walking, and ""deviation"", defined as the intensity of the barrier. An analysis applied to Buenos Aires to detect these urban barriers is done using open and cartographic data.

Quantifying these negative consequences of urban sprawl can be extremely helpful for local and regional decision making. Numerous methods have been developed to quantify urban sprawl and its consequences and land use models have been used to study possible effects in the future. The results of these studies, however, do not always find their way to policy makers because they are often too abstract for them. In order to bridge this science-policy gap, this study proposes a participatory approach to make existing methods and models more fit for policy purposes. The study focuses on three policy questions: (1) how to quantify urban sprawl in a way that is more intuitive for policy makers to use in their communication, (2) how to quantify the costs of infrastructure and mobility related to urban sprawl and (3) how will these costs evolve towards the future? Three urban growth scenarios were simulated using a land use model and the outputs of the model were translated to an urban sprawl typology and corresponding costs for infrastructure and mobility. This allows to evaluate potential monetary savings of alternative urban development patterns. The results show that costs for infrastructure and mobility are much higher for patterns dominated by dispersed buildings and ribbon development than in more dense types of urban development in Flanders. The scenarios show that gradually bringing back urban growth could lead to annual savings of 246-383 million euros in terms of reduced investments and maintenance costs for infrastructure and annual savings of 1156-1965 million euros in terms of costs for mobility. Quantifying the potential savings of alternative scenarios of urban growth offers planners and policy makers insight into practical consequences of strategic decisions for development plans that are critical to implement sustainable urban development.",Urban sprawl,Economic impact,Spatial policy,Participatory modelling,Sustainable urban development,Land use modelling,LAND-USE CHANGE,PATTERNS,RUNOFF,DESIGN,IMPACT,TRAVEL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At a time when the welfare and social service system is weakening, residential property values are increasing, and wages remain stagnant, individuals must turn their homes into investment assets in order to increase their social opportunities. Following the Planning Deal and the Regeneration Deal, the interpretative scheme of the 'Social Deal' incorporates two fields: the city as a growth machine, and the social mobility of the homeowners. Through the theoretical demonstration of the notion of IPSM through urban regeneration in Israel, we propose the Social Deal as a new way of understanding the rent gap discussion - i.e., not only as a result of the cultural preferences of consumers on the one hand, or of real estate developers and market supply on the other hand, but also as a means to the self-profit of the residents.",Displacement,homeownership,urban regeneration,house price inflation,rent gap,Israel,GENTRIFICATION,CITY,RENEWAL,POLICY,STATE,MODEL,NEOLIBERALISM,BACK,HOME,,,,,,,,,,,

Crucially, the efficiency of an MoD system highly depends on how well supply and demand distributions are aligned in spatio-temporal space (i.e., to satisfy user demand, cars have to be available in the correct place and at the desired time). To do so, we argue that predictive models should aim to explicitly disentangle between temporal and spatial variability in the evolution of urban mobility demand. However, current approaches typically ig-nore this distinction by either treating both sources of variability jointly, or completely ignoring their presence in the first place. In this paper, we propose recurrent flow networks1 (RFN), where we explore the inclusion of (i) latent random variables in the hidden state of recurrent neural networks to model temporal variability, and (ii) normalizing flows to model the spatial distribution of mobility demand. We demonstrate how predictive models explicitly disentangling between spatial and temporal variability ex-hibit several desirable properties, and empirically show how this enables the generation of distributions matching potentially complex urban topologies.

As space is one of cities' scarcest resources, mobility's spatial footprint is increasingly scrutinized as externality to mitigate. Similar to passenger transport, goods transport is envisioned to shift towards efficient and zero emission mobilities. To achieve an urban logistics system that eliminates inefficiencies and fossil fuels, the logistics sector requires space to unload, cross-dock, consolidate and stock goods closer to their destinations. Such a 'proximity logistics' is however at odds with 'logistics sprawl', the historic outward migration pattern of logistics facilities. With policies and planning, cities can support the (re)integration of logistics facilities in urban areas to facilitate and enable the shift to an efficient urban logistics system. Logistics still being a largely neglected policy subject in many cities, knowledge on how to approach this (re)integration is hardly available. Therefore, we compare two pioneering cities: Rotterdam and Paris.

Emission reductions from lower use of public transport were not realised, nor a reduction of indirect emissions from vehicle production due to slowly responding upstream demand and public transport planning.

To improve engagement of elderly residents in local community decision making and urban space improvement, two online web mapping applications based on Emotinalmaps.eu were designed. They are intended to collect seniors' emotions and mark mobility targets. The application utilizes Leaflet library, MySQL database and stores spatial data in GeoJSON. The results of the first campaign in two Czech cities show differences in radii of attractive and repulsive places and paths and provide important information on what the reasons for attractivity/repulsivity are for local elderly. Steep slopes, slippery surfaces, and stairs were recognised as the main barriers. Fourteen categories of mobility targets were marked by respondents. Their spatial distribution was compared against a distribution of all available targets. The testing of M-function confirmed the significant clustering of marked targets for small distances (200-380 m). The distance analysis of targets shows that the selection of targets in an urban close neighbourhood is not driven by the shortest distance and that is why the selection of targets in urban accessibility analysis should not use the distance order of targets, such as the closest facility, but rather a distance threshold or gravity weightings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we employ spatial statistics and graph network to quantify the characteristics of travel behavior. Firstly, spatiotemporal statistics analysis was conducted to investigate the travel patterns and spatiotemporal differences of bike-sharing in Beijing. It was found that bike trips have clear peak hours and highly overlap with the subway lines, indicating that the bike-sharing system effectively completes the 'last mile' of travel in Beijing. Secondly, graph networks were used to reveal the core patterns and community structures of human mobility in Beijing and their connections to daily activities.

In particular, much discussion has concentrated on the measurement of distance decay on the regional scale, since the emphasis of the model utilisation has been on explaining inter-regional mobility (mainly commuting). The intra-urban context makes the estimation more complicated and the fundamental questions, such as how far people travel within the city to reach a variety of urban destinations, and whether there are potentially significant differences between these types of destinations, are still not answered in a satisfactory way. In response to this challenge, the paper attempts to reveal the spatial variations of the distance decay effect on movements in urban space through the utilisation of mobile phone data. The signalling data from all major mobile network operators in Slovakia represent new opportunities with high accuracy of measurement and complexity of representation. The methodological procedure for deriving data about human daily move-ments from the mobile network at the level of 1 x 1 km statistical grid cells is presented. The objective is to estimate the appropriate distance decay functions for urban grids and demonstrate the variation of decay curves within the Bratislava city. The findings relativise the decay law of human mobility. For the approximation of daily mobility within the urban area, the polynomial-exponential function - the decreasing function with a small increase of interaction intensity at a greater distance - describes the impedance of travel distance more pref-erably. However, a significant proportion of urban grids have recorded weak or even no decay. A question worth investigating is whether the resulting friction of distance is a result of a specific functional structure of the study area, or it could reflect an advanced stage of urban evolution.",Distance decay variation,Mobile phone data,Daily mobility,Urban grid,SPATIAL INTERACTION,ACCESSIBILITY,MODELS,FORM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These heterogenous transmission patterns could stem from human mobility, yet the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. Here, we employ an agent-based model incorporating urban scaling structure to simulate fine-grained mobility and the human-to-human transmission process. Our results reveal that not only the quantity but also the scaling structure of mobility profoundly influences local transmission risk. Urban scaling structure is characterized by a widely found power-law scaling distribution of mobility volumes across different locations. By integrating this structure, our model fits reasonably well with empirical Omicron data at various spatial scales in Hong Kong. Further analyses show a positive association between the scaling index, representing the location's importance within the structure, and local transmission risks among urban areas as well as the likelihood of becoming superspreaders among local visitors. This implies that urban scaling structure could offer the first-mover advantage to a minority of places and individuals to infect earlier and thus infect more.

In the process of change towards more sustainable mobility patterns in peripheral areas, commuter railways must play a predominant role because of their capacity and speed. The main aim of this paper is to analyse commuter rail stations' catchment areas (SCAs) to identify typologies of these nodes in large metropolitan areas as a key step in proposing strategies for making mobility much more sustainable, both in the medium and proximity scales, by promoting soft mobility towards stations, a strategy that will facilitate commuters' use of daily rail transport. The method proposed is based on a twofold clustering analysis. The first is to consider urban-planning variables to detect consolidated stations; the second is to use both public space and land-use variables to characterise the quality of the urban environment for walking/cycling. These methods are applied in the metropolitan area of Madrid and offer some key insights. The results show that different typologies are found - from consolidated, dense and mixed-use SCAs, with large residential developments, to low-density SCAs in sprawl areas or low consolidated mixed-use SCAs with large parking spaces, following the park-and-ride model, among others. This identification of SCAs' typologies is key for policy makers to propose different strategies, which could be small projects oriented towards improving public spaces promoting soft mobility, or deeper changes that require a re-densification process in the stations' surroundings, breaking with the rigid definition of transit-oriented developments and adapting the decisions taken to each context.",Station catchment area,Disperse urban periphery,Sustainable urban environment,Transit-oriented development,Commuter railway,LAND-USE,TRANSIT,TRANSPORT,ACCESSIBILITY,DENSITY,TRAVEL,TOD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It can allow more flexible allocation of public resources such as public transportation schedule adjustment and arrangement of police force. After 2020, because of the epidemic of COVID-19 virus, the public mobility pattern is deeply affected by the situation of epidemic as the physical close contact is the dominant way of infection. In this study, we propose a confirmed case-driven time-series prediction of crowd in urban hot spot named MobCovid. The model is a deviation of Informer, a popular time-serial prediction model proposed in 2021. The model takes both the number of nighttime staying people in downtown and confirmed cases of COVID-19 as input and predicts both the targets. In the current period of COVID, many areas and countries have relaxed the lockdown measures on public mobility. The outdoor travel of public is based on individual decision. Report of large amount of confirmed cases would restrict the public visitation of crowded downtown. But, still, government would publish some policies to try to intervene in the public mobility and control the spread of virus. For example, in Japan, there are no compulsory measures to force people to stay at home, but measures to persuade people to stay away from downtown area. Therefore, we also merge the encoding of policies on measures of mobility restriction made by government in the model to improve the precision. We use historical data of nighttime staying people in crowded downtown and confirmed cases of Tokyo and Osaka area as study case. Multiple times of comparison with other baselines including the original Informer model prove the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Existing endeavours into strategic pre-flight functions focus on improving the route generation and strategic deconfliction of these routes. Introduced with the urban air mobility concept is the premise of operational volumes. These 4D regions of airspace, describe the intended operational region for an aircraft for finite time. Chaining these together forms a contract of finite operational volumes over a given route. It is no longer enough to only deconflict routes within the airspace, but to now consider these 4D operational volumes. To provide an effective all-in-one approach, we propose a novel framework for generating routes and accompanying contracts of operational volumes, along with deconfliction focused around 4D operational volumes.

The results show that both areas have medium levels of accessibility if cycling is used as the primary mode of transportation. Hence, improving the safety and quality of cycling in both cities emerges as one of the main recommendations from the research.

Recreational mobilities at various temporal and spatial scales thus tend to be overlooked or ignored altogether. Drawing on the interdisciplinary explorations presented in this special issue of Mobilities, a provisional agenda for research and practice is presented.

In England's context, these indicators unfolding mobility patterns and social issues display different scaling regimes, varying from sublinear to super-linear. It was observed that larger cities are associated with greater social interactions, particularly among socioeconomically advantaged groups; however, they also exhibit exacerbated self-segregation. Due to the radiation effect of big cities, the performances (e.g. travel radius) of small surrounding towns deviate from the predicted values of scaling models.

This paper explores how the role adopted by municipalities-as the formal actor behind institutional arrangements and a key player in urban experimentation-can affect the transitional capacity of street experiments. Using a theoretical framework combining three ideal-typical roles (promoter, enabler and partner) and transitional capacity, we analyze the relationship between the municipality and the Living Streets program in Ghent, Belgium. Our findings reveal that the municipal leadership and subsequent legitimacy accompanied by the promoter and enabler roles can benefit the transitional capacity of experiments in nascent stages, especially when they are radical and potentially contentious. Additionally, the provision of financial, material and human resources, are necessary regardless of role. Lastly, we highlight two dilemmas related to city street experiments and urban mobility: First, should city street experiments be temporarily employed and disbanded once their transitional capacity decreases?

Finally, a density-based expansion strategy is employed to detect the spatial areas and temporal durations of sources and sinks.

Quality of pedestrian mobility is the key to attain liveability and inclusivity in a city. However, the gender lens towards understanding the mobility patterns of women and young girls is largely missing from the urban planning process. Due to this exclusion, the majority of Indian cities are not gender friendly. To address this issue, this study tried to propose a 3 step framework for mitigating gender safety issues while a woman walks in a city. The 3 steps involve identifying the key elements of pedestrian mobility; quantitatively evaluating the qualitative parameters; and visual analysis for validating the major issues. This paper presents a pilot study conducted in the city of Kanpur, India. The research was initiated by conducting focus group discussions among 23 participants to map their typical movement patterns and identify 6 key elements of pedestrian mobility. Subsequently, the study conducted a net promoter score (NPS) survey among 423 participants to gauge the safety perception levels on each of the 6 key elements against 5 deduced qualitative parameters via literature review. NPS is a user satisfaction measurement tool which is based on the user perception used by companies and brands. Since urban safety is largely to do with perception, a NPS metric is employed. Further, the paper employed heatmap analysis and derived 3 critical areas based on gender safety perception to deep dive i.e. accessibility and lighting at sidewalks; lack of lighting at underpass; and absence of street furniture at bus stops. Visual analysis was undertaken to understand and validate the respective safety perceptions.

The results show that urban residents prefer to move around in places with a higher quantity and quality of urban green space. The magnitude of the influence of urban green spatial features on population heat difference shows that accessibility > quantity > quality.

To address this knowledge gap, this study introduces a novel method for assessing vitality through the lens of human mobility.

Building on this evaluation, a resilience indicator is further established to measure the recovery of vitality, and the geographically weighted regression is employed to investigate the factors influencing vitality, with their spatial and temporal changes being explored. Our findings reveal that, as of June 2023, the overall urban vitality in Shenzhen has only recovered to 86% of the level during the same period in 2019, with certain districts exhibiting a continuous decline in vitality even as the epidemic subsided.

[1]",Bodies of transnational island urbanism: Spatial narratives of inclusion/exclusion of Filipinas in Philippine islands,URBAN STUDIES,DEC 2022,2,"Tropical islands can become terrains of urbanisation worthy of examination. In the Philippines, several islands have experienced urban transformation (capital accumulation, immigration, diversification, land conversion) through tourism. At the forefront of these urban transformations are Filipinas, particularly those in interracial relationships with foreign men who invest in island properties and establish resorts. These resorts stimulate a transnationally-oriented mode of urban transformation reliant on the transnational mobilities of tourists, expats and capital. This paper examines this by foregrounding the experiences of Filipinas, concentrating on how they are differentially included and excluded throughout the multi-scalar process of island urban accumulation. I locate these differential experiences in various spaces (nation, community, resort, households), noting in particular the (1) national discourses underlying state tourism and foreign retirement programmes, (2) transactions enabling property purchases and resorts, and (3) translocal mobilities sustaining urban accumulation. What emerge from these accounts are the selective inclusions and exclusions of Filipinas in transnational urban accumulation in the islands. While their role in facilitating island urban accumulation may suggest a form of 'empowered' inclusivity, this can easily be undercut by sexist micropolitics of exclusion that tend to reduce them to 'mere women' and/or 'prostitutes'. Such differential practices of inclusion/exclusion demonstrate the gendered dynamics that unequally put a double burden on Filipinas. Unravelling these accounts demonstrates how gendered relations and sexuality are important forces underpinning urban transformation and transnational mobilities that constitute diversification.",Filipina,gender,islands,transnationalism,urbanisation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extant literature has suggested that the strength of place attachment is curvilinear across different geographical scales. However, limited research has investigated how processes and changes of residential mobility, embedded in different socioeconomic and structural settings, shape people's place attachment at the neighbourhood and city scales. To address this shortfall in the literature, this study employs a process-based perspective by reconciling past housing experiences with that of the present to investigate how residential mobility affects place attachment based on a large-scale survey in Shanghai in 2021. The findings show that the processual residential mobility relays profound influences on place attachment at different geographical scales. Specifically, homeownership secures residents' a privileged multi-scale attachment. Meanwhile, access to state welfare housing in the past and at present, as well as residential moves driven by individual needs are more likely to engender a single-scale attachment. Experiences with housing relocation and market rental exert negative influences on place attachment at both the city and neighbourhood scales. Both housing policy-related structural factors and socioeconomic status have led to marginalised residential mobility, consequently entailing a sense of 'placelessness' in urban China.",place attachment,residential mobility,scale,housing experiences,urban China,COMMUNITY,MIGRANTS,REDEVELOPMENT,HOMEOWNERSHIP,CONSUMPTION,TRANSITION,CITIES,SENSE,LIFE,HOME,,,,,,,,,,,

Existing studies often overlook the transitions between different transportation modes. This study develops a framework that measures the spatiotemporal anomalies of mobilities and builds transition paths across multiple modes to reveal how people adapt to extreme weather. Analyzing four extreme rainfall events in New York City, we find that Citibike riders are most sensitive to rainfall. In the absence of subway disruptions, they tend to switch to the subway. When the subway system is paralyzed, indicating flooding of the system by heavy rainfall, riders shift to For-Hire Vehicles, followed by taxis. Both demonstrate the value of flexible service in urban resilience. The paralysis-prone subway and the uneven distribution of flexible service indicate that the current transit infrastructure lacks coordination and is unprepared for climate change. Recommendations for enhancing urban resilience include upgrading and maintaining the subway system; enhancing inter-transportation-modal coordination; introducing amphibious transportation modes; improving pre-disaster awareness of inland populations; encouraging safety shared ride; and connecting affordable transition paths for underprivileged groups.",Extreme rainfalls,human mobility,urban resilience,transition path,disaster management,VULNERABILITY,SYSTEMS,TIME,CITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Air operations in urban areas can present added complexity as compared with traditional air traffic management. As a result, it is necessary to test and develop novel airspace designs and rules. As airspace in urban areas is a scarce resource, creating structures and rules that effectively utilise the airspace is an important challenge. This work specifically focuses on layered airspace design in urban operations constrained to fly between the existing buildings. Two design parameters of airspace design are investigated with two sub-experiments. Sub-experiment 1 investigates layer function assignment by comparing concepts from previous research with different layer assignment distributions. Sub-experiment 2 investigates the flight rules of vertical distribution of traffic within the airspace, to determine whether this is best achieved in a static (pre-allocated) or dynamic manner. Both sub-experiments analyse the overall system safety, route duration, and route distance under increasing traffic demand. Results reveal that the importance of cruising airspace is apparent at high densities. Results also shows that the safest layer allocation flight rule depends on the traffic density. At lower densities dynamic rules help to spread traffic locally.

Understanding human mobility in Britain during the COVID-19 pandemic using Meta-Facebook data,POPULATION SPACE AND PLACE,JAN 2023,47,"Existing empirical work has focused on assessing the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions on human mobility to contain the spread of COVID-19. Less is known about the ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped the spatial patterns of population movement within countries. Anecdotal evidence of an urban exodus from large cities to rural areas emerged during early phases of the pandemic across western societies. Yet, these claims have not been empirically assessed. Traditional data sources, such as censuses offer coarse temporal frequency to analyse population movement over infrequent time intervals. Drawing on a data set of 21 million observations from Meta-Facebook users, we aim to analyse the extent and evolution of changes in the spatial patterns of population movement across the rural-urban continuum in Britain over an 18-month period from March 2020 to August 2021. Our findings show an overall and sustained decline in population movement during periods of high stringency measures, with the most densely populated areas reporting the largest reductions. During these periods, we also find evidence of higher-than-average mobility from high-density population areas to low-density areas, lending some support to claims of large-scale population movements from large cities. Yet, we show that these trends were temporary. Overall mobility levels trended back to precoronavirus levels after the easing of nonpharmaceutical interventions. Following these interventions, we found a reduction in movement to low-density areas and a rise in mobility to high-density agglomerations. Overall, these findings reveal that while COVID-19 generated shock waves leading to temporary changes in the patterns of population movement in Britain, the resulting vibrations have not significantly reshaped the prevalent structures in the national pattern of population movement.

Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, the research combines qualitative insights with quantitative data analysis based on surveys conducted in two strategically selected urban areas of Nicosia, Cyprus. Through the survey, the requirements and potential use of Smart Pedestrian apps are investigated while accounting for the quality of service of the urban infrastructure in a medium-sized city context. Additionally, the study contrasts the current smartphone applications, as they predominantly facilitate vehicular transportation, with the potential use of ICT/ITS to support pedestrians for sustainable mobility. The findings reveal a significant demand for a Pedestrian Smartphone app, driven by its ability to provide relevant information on optimum pedestrian routes, as well as act as a citizen's voice for spotting infrastructure problems and improving the pedestrian network. Further, it is also revealed that limitations in the pedestrian infrastructure substantially restrict walking preferences, emphasizing the need for urgent city-level urban planning solutions to support active mobility. Additionally, the research carried out underscores the importance of a sustainable business model to support the successful deployment of Smart Pedestrian apps. Ultimately, the results of the study suggest prioritizing a smart technology leverage with a crowdsourcing social network business model to promote pedestrian mobility, thereby reducing vehicular dependence, enhancing public health, and improving the quality of life.

The objective of this work is to quantitatively assess the city's master plan guidelines which encourage the decrease in the job-housing distance, through the creation of local job offers in the suburbs to effectively decrease the commuting time of the suburban population. The analysis was carried out using a specific spatial regression model (the Spatial Error Durbin Model), using data from an extensive origin-destination survey. Results show that an increase in 10% in local job offers in a 7-km radius buffer in Sao Paulo would decrease the mean distance travelled in about 5.2%, which would be particularly beneficial for the suburban areas. This highlights the importance of incorporating the spatial planning of land use within transport planning in a megacity environment. Therefore, policymakers should consider strategies to bring housing and jobs closer as means to not only decrease transport inequities, but also to mitigate pollutant emissions, health burdens and economic losses, leading to overall improvements in quality of life.

Residents of older compact neighbourhoods are found to participate more frequently in activities locally and seem to have stronger local social ties than residents of newly densified neighbourhoods. Moreover, residents' insights suggest that newly densified neighbourhoods are often inadequately designed or developed in terms of physical attributes, and this may contribute to possible moving intentions.

This review describes the latest advances in CFD simulations applied to urban wind and the alternatives that exist for the coupling with the mesoscale model. First, the distinct turbulence models are introduced, analyzing their advantages and limitations. Secondly, a study of the meshing is introduced, exploring how it has to be adapted to the characteristics of the urban environment. Then, the several alternatives for the definition of the boundary conditions and the interpolation methods for the initial conditions are described. As a key step, the available order reduction methods applicable to the models are presented, so the size and operability of the wind database can be reduced as much as possible. Finally, the data assimilation techniques and the model validation are presented.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

UAM operations are intended to be conducted in low altitudes where microscale turbulent wind flow conditions are prevalent. This introduces flight testing, certification, and operational complexities. To tackle these issues, the UAM industry, aviation authorities, and research communities across the world have provided prescriptive ways, such as the implementation of dynamic weather corridors for safe operation, classification of atmospheric disturbance levels for certification, etc., within the proposed concepts of operation (ConOps), certification standards, and guidelines. However, a notable hindrance to the efficacy of these solutions lies in the scarcity of operational UAM and observational wind data in urban environments. One way to address this deficiency in data is via microscale wind modelling, which has been long established in the context of studying atmospheric dynamics, weather forecasting, turbine blade load estimation, etc. Thus, this paper aims to provide a critical literature review of a variety of wind flow estimation and forecasting techniques that can be and have been utilized by the UAM community.

A better understanding of human mobility in rural areas could inform efforts to achieve rural revitalization. However, there have been limited evaluations of the characteristics of human mobility in rural areas. Based on human movements estimated from mobile phone data, we constructed an inter-town human mobility network and applied a complex network analysis method to study the spatial characteristics of the human mobility network in rural areas, with China's Greater Bay Area as a case study. We found that rural towns with high centrality were mostly located at the convergence of developed megacities. Rural towns with most connections were not necessarily the most central in the inter-town human mobility networks, leading to anomalous values of the centrality. We demonstrated that the anomaly of centrality values emerged due to the community structure of the network. We identified nine communities in the network and found that the geographical borders of communities partly matched the urban administrative borders. However, the results also showed that many rural towns on the fringes of a city were dissolved in their adjacent developed cities, independent of the urban administrative boundary effect. The formation of communities cannot be explained only by the impacts of urban administrative boundaries, but also by the growth of large cities and the geographic dispersal of economic activities. Finally, we identified seven roles of rural towns based on their pattern of intra-community and inter-community connections.

Many decided to settle there permanently, either by making their second homes their main residences, or by purchasing or renting new property. This has created severe social, infrastructural and environmental problems in these towns because of transformed demographics, a largely unregulated construction boom, increased renovation activities and an unprecedented rise in real-estate and consumer-goods prices. In this article we contextualize these problems in relation to the Justice and Development Party's neoliberal policies of urban governance and rescaling in the past 15 years. The government, having given the construction sector the main role in Turkey's economic development, subsequently granted it new spatial opportunities through the authoritarian and centralized allocation of urban and rural land. Coastal towns have been the target of unregulated urban growth and predatory construction in this process and have thus provided new spatial development prospects. Local governmental reform in 2012, which introduced radical urban rescaling and weakened district municipalities' planning and regulation capacities, further intensified the process.

The location big data obtained from human activities, which is cohesive with urban functions, provides valuable insights into human mobility patterns. However, as urban functions become highly mixed, existing feature representation structures struggle to explicitly depict the latent human activity features, limiting their applicability for detecting mixed urban functions in a supervised manner. To close the gap, this study analogizes the latent human activity features to the shape, texture, and color semantics of images, with a contrastive learning framework being introduced to extract image -based crowd mobility features for detecting mixed urban functions. Firstly, by translating human activity features into image semantics, a novel feature representation structure termed the Trajectory Temporal Image (TTI) is proposed to explicitly represent human activity features. Secondly, the Vision Transformer (ViT) model is employed to extract image -based semantics in a self -supervised manner. Lastly, based on urban dynamics, a mathematical model is developed to represent mixed urban functions, and the decomposition of mixed urban functions is achieved using the theory of fuzzy sets. A case study is conducted using taxi trajectory data in three cities in China. Experimental results indicate the high discriminability of our proposed method, especially in areas with weak activity intensity, and reveal the relationship between the mixture index and the trip distance.

With BIDs now existing for over 50 years, the purpose of this paper is to provide an overdue reappraisal of the BID research and orient future scholarship. After describing key debates from early BID research, this paper analyses two distinct themes in more recent scholarship: (1) BID policy mobility, and (2) BIDs and social regulation. As the BID model has been transferred to new locations across both the Global North and South, its rapid mobility demonstrates the permeability, resilience and limits of neoliberal urban policies. Moreover, BIDs' social control tactics highlight how these organisations are shaped by a neoliberal logic that seeks to manage and control urban spaces in ways that attract desirable consumers and exclude the visible poor.

These restrictions have also played a significant role in controlling the spread of other diseases, including those that do not require direct contact between individuals for transmission, such as dengue. In this study, we investigate the impact of human mobility on the dynamics of dengue transmission in a large metropolis. We compare data on the spread of the disease over a nine-year period with data from 2020 when strict mobility restrictions were in place. This comparison enables us to accurately assess how mobility restrictions have influenced the rate of dengue propagation and their potential for preventing an epidemic year. We observed a delay in the onset of the disease in some neighborhoods and a decrease in cases in the initially infected areas. Using a predictive model based on neural networks capable of estimating the potential spread of the disease in the absence of mobility restrictions for each neighborhood, we quantified the change in the number of cases associated with social distancing measures. Our findings with this model indicate a substantial reduction of approximately 72% in dengue cases in the city of Fortaleza throughout the year 2020. Additionally, using an Interrupted Time Series (ITS) model, we obtained results showing a strong correlation between the prevention of dengue and low human mobility, corresponding to a reduction of approximately 45% of cases.

These vehicles are designed for short-haul flights, transporting passengers and cargo between urban centers, suburbs, and remote areas. As the number of flights is expected to rise significantly in congested metropolitan areas, there is a need for a digital ecosystem to support the AAM platform. This ecosystem requires seamless integration of air traffic management systems, ground control systems, and communication networks, enabling effective communication between AAM vehicles and ground systems to ensure safe and efficient operations. Consequently, the aviation industry is seeking to develop a new aerospace framework that promotes shared aerospace practices, ensuring the safety, sustainability, and efficiency of air traffic operations. However, the lack of adequate wireless coverage in congested cities and disconnected rural communities poses challenges for large-scale AAM deployments. In the immediate recovery phase, incorporating AAM with new air-to-ground connectivity presents difficulties such as overwhelming the terrestrial network with data requests, maintaining link reliability, and managing handover occurrences. Furthermore, managing eVTOL traffic in urban areas with congested airspace necessitates high levels of connectivity to support air routing information for eVTOL vehicles.

This paper examines the spatio-temporal patterns and practices of active commuting and evaluates their significance in the context of sustainable urban mobility. The empirical research is based on data obtained from a questionnaire survey and semistructured interviews conducted in 2023 in the Brno Metropolitan Area. Based on the data, three categories of active commuting were identified, namely pragmatic active commuting, physical active commuting, and combined active commuting, which differ in the implementation of different spatio-temporal practices. For the development of sustainable transport in the city, it is necessary to promote the construction of pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure, with the aim of making movement for pedestrians and cyclists more straightforward, efficient, and safer, including paying attention to actions leading to the embedding of this mode of transport in the wider societal context.",Active commuting,spatio-temporal practices,urban mobility,transport mode,Brno Metropolitan Area,physical activity,PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY,WALKING BEHAVIOR,TRAVEL,TRANSPORT,BICYCLE,WORK,DISTANCE,MODE,CAR,ASSOCIATIONS,,,,,,,,,,

The pandemic caused uneven regional consequences. In addition to the differences in the number of infected persons, the mortality rate, and the number of vaccinated between individual countries, disparities between rural and urban areas are particularly evident. Fundamental differences in transport infrastructure and mobility behavior between urban and rural populations suggest differences in risk perception and future travel behavior. However, urban-rural disparities in travel behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic have hardly been explored so far, and this study aims to help fill this gap. The aim of this paper is to investigate the changes and differences in travel risk perceptions and travel behavior of urban and rural residents under the influence of the pandemic. Analyses were conducted based on an online survey data collection in June 2021 among 399 urban and 260 rural residents of Serbia. The results showed differences in travel intentions, travel frequency, and destination choice between urban and rural residents, as well as a preference for domestic tourism and short-haul travel.

Their institutionalization at the domestic level is favoured by the rather aseptic ""urban paradigm shift"" that these documents present. However, the process according to which this happens is subject to path-dependent logics and varies from one context to another. Purpose Stemming from the policy mobilities literature, the article explores the role that ""pasteurized"" urban narratives play in the domestic institutionalization of the global urban development frameworks. At the same time, it analyses how domestic institutional configurations have influenced their differential implementation in two Latin American countries. Methods and approach The article details the cases of the Ecuadorian National Urban Agenda and the Bolivian National Urban Policy, employing a mixed methodology that includes participant observation, consultancy activities, desk-research, and semi-structured interviews. Findings The analysis findings show that, on the one hand, the ""comfortable landscape"" offered by the ""pasteurized concepts"" that comprise the global urban development frameworks served as a ""coalition magnet"" favouring the building of consensus among stakeholders with rather different positions. On the other hand, however, this may result in a ""fast-track institutionalization"" that prevents the concrete engagement of local governments in the process, in turn undermining the relevance of the results achieved.

The result shows that the urban network becomes more equitable and less concentrated in a few dominant cities. This shift suggests a more balanced distribution of resources, opportunities, and development across the urban agglomerations.

This is because older people, especially those with disabilities, are often faced with mobility exclusion due to physical barriers around the public transportation and built environment. This has been further intensified as existing mobility accessibility initiatives employed by municipalities have not involved vulnerable groups in society such as older people. Therefore, this study adopts a systematic literature review based on data collected from 83 sources indexed in Scopus and Web of Science database.

These dynamics are affected by a variety of variables, spanning economic, structural, political and environmental. With respect to this latter aspect, much research has explored the relationship between the development of urban green areas, the increase of price and the formation of gentrification. Within this context, the present work explores housing mobility and gentrification dynamics proposing a mixed-method approach that combines a spatially explicit agent-based model (ABM), a Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and a Hedonic Price (HP). The case study of the transformation project of Victoria Park in Brisbane (Australia) is used to verify the applicability of this integrated approach. In the methodological framework proposed, the ABM simulates the housing mobility of the residents through an individual decision-making process, where the likelihood of mobility is based on various empirical endogenous factors (i.e., household socio-economic characteristics) and exogenous ones (i.e., market variation). The MCDA supports the identification of the relative importance of these factors using a panel of local experts and stakeholders. The Spatial HP explores the impact of urban parks on real estate prices. The current study found the abilities of MCDA and HP to reduce the assumptions of ABM by generating quali-quantitative information of citizens' behaviors and estimating price increase. Moreover, the model highlights the importance of considering both supply and demand sides when analyzing gentrification.

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end multimodal deep learning algorithm for detecting AOI fence polygon using remote sensing images and multi-semantics reference information. We then evaluate its timeliness through a cascaded module that incorporates dynamic human mobility and logistics address information. Specifically, we begin by selecting a point-of-interest (POI) of specific category, and use it to recall corresponding remote sensing images, nearby POIs, road nodes, human mobility, and logistics addresses to build a multimodal detection model based on transformer encoder-decoder architecture, titled AOITR. In the model, in addition to the remote sensing images, multi-semantic information including core POI and road nodes is embedded and reorganized as the query content part for the transformer decoder to generate the AOI polygon. Meanwhile, relatively dynamic distribution features of human mobility, nearby POIs, and logistics addresses are used for AOI reliability evaluation through a cascaded feedforward network.

Triggered by the greater emphasis on sustainable urban environments following the global pandemic, the research employs a mobility -based approach to assess the model's applicability across various urban districts. Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping is used to identify 'liveable areas' in business, residential, and industrial districts where essential services are accessible within three different thresholds of 5, 10, and 15 min walking distance. This tiered approach offers a detailed view of urban accessibility, highlighting the practicality and varying implementation levels of the 15 -minute city concept across diverse urban areas. Geolocated mobile phone data from 88,660 residents is analysed with a focus on 'inflow' and 'outflow' travel distances at both city and district levels.

The possession of rural land and other local resources, in contrast, tends to deter migration to urban destinations.

Findings suggest that bike-sharing users are more likely to be younger, men, single, concerned about climate change, and living in denser neighborhoods with good access to public transport. E-scooter sharing users are more likely to be younger, men, without disabilities, and less educated, and live in denser neighborhoods. Car-sharing users are more likely to be living with a partner or spouse and children, not have access to a private car, and live in transit-oriented neighborhoods. Uber users are more likely to be younger and less educated, have higher incomes, be less worried about climate change, and live in proximity to the city center.

We used an interdisciplinary quanti-qualitative approach combining descriptive and multivariate analyses performed on original population register microdata on residential moves and ethnographic fieldwork to understand the dynamics of relocations from a multifaceted perspective. Rome is an interesting case study because it is a Southern European metropolis and the capital of Italy, a country with a welfare regime and a housing system that peculiarly affects the residential segregation and mobility patterns of ethnic groups. The findings show that the socioeconomic situation of the Filipinos' previous neighbourhood 'predicts' the characteristics of the neighbourhood where they move, with a growing propensity of family groups to head to more peripheral, poorer neighbourhoods with a low-medium concentration of co-nationals.

Furthermore, the dynamic and complex urban mobility environments make the station placement highly challenging to satisfy the mobility needs.To ease and facilitate the urban planning with awareness of mobility equity, we have designed and proposed CGIRL, a novel equity-aware Cross-Graph Interactive Reinforcement Learning approach for BSN expansion recommendation. Specifically, we have designed a novel reward function within our actor-critic reinforcement learning approach, jointly accounting for the local mobility, bike resource distribution equity, and accessibility of different socioeconomic groups to the expanded stations. To capture the policy of station decisions from the BSN deployment, we integrate the location graph's mobility and equity correlations across the city regions as a graph network, and design a novel cross-graph interaction network with embedding attention and sequential dependency that adaptively captures and interactively differentiates the correlations within station placement. Our extensive experimental studies upon a total of 393 (111 new) bike stations from New York City (NYC), Washington D.C.

Traditionally, segregation has been studied mainly through a residential lens or in places like work or education.

This study analyzes disparities between the proportion of foreign-born residents that people experience in their residential areas versus the locations they visit in New Zealand. It uses a large mobile app dataset to operationalize activity spaces for approximately 620,000 people. The findings reveal that during daily mobility, intergroup exposure increases, which may play a mitigating role in potential segregation. We also find that residents in areas with many foreign-born residents tend to visit areas with fewer foreign-born residents, while the opposite holds for those in areas with few foreign-born residents. This study delves into the nuances of this correlation, demonstrating, for example, that the relationship between the ratio of foreign-born residents and the contrast experienced between residential and activity spaces is stronger in larger cities, suggesting that mobility may exert the most significant impact on mitigating segregation in such settings.",Mobility,segregation,migratory background,activity spaces,mobile app data,INTERGROUP CONTACT,ETHNIC SEGREGATION,ACTIVITY SPACES,HUMAN MOBILITY,PATTERNS,NEIGHBORHOODS,ASSIMILATION,INEQUALITIES,DIFFERENCE,CONTEXT,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the settlements under study has undergone redevelopment, while the other remains on the waitlist for redevelopment. Additionally, the study explores potential gender-based variations in independent mobility and outdoor play time, shedding light on the distinct effects of redevelopment on boys and girls. Questionnaires were administered to mothers, addressing aspects such as independent mobility licenses, the range of independent mobility, the age at which mobility licenses are granted, and the duration of outdoor play of children. Findings show that children in slum settlement were reported to have more mobility licenses, broader independent mobility range, and earlier licenses than children in redeveloped settlement. Gender differences are evident, with girls in redeveloped settlement receiving mobility licenses later than both boys and girls in slum settlement, but boys' age at which they received independent mobility licenses remained consistent regardless of their place of residence. Boys in the redeveloped settlement engage in more outdoor play time than boys and girls in slum settlement. Conversely, girls in slum settlement participate in more outdoor play time than those in redeveloped settlement. These findings have important implications for slum redevelopment policies, highlighting the need to consider morphological aspects of residential environments that support girls' outdoor play time and independent mobility.

We find a general spreading pattern in all cities: the spatial distribution of confirmed cases follows a power-law-like model and the spreading centroid human mobility is time-invariant. Moreover, we reveal that long average traveling distance results in a high growth rate of spreading radius and wide spatial diffusion of confirmed cases in the fine-grained geographic model. With such insight, we adopt the Kendall model to simulate the urban spreading of COVID-19 which can well fit the real spreading process.

A natural experiment analysis of mobility resilience and disparity,CITIES,SEP 2023,6,"Urban rail transit networks provide critical access to opportunities and livelihood in many urban systems. Ensuring that these services are resilient (that is, exhibiting efficient responses to and recovery from disruptions) is a key economic and social priority. Increasingly, the ability of urban rail systems to cope with disruptions is a function of a complex patchwork of mobility options, wherein alternative modes can complement and fill occurring service gaps. This study analyzes the role of ridesourcing in providing adaptive mobility capacity that could be leveraged to fill no-notice gaps in rail transit services, addressing the question of distributional impacts of resilience. Using a natural experiment, we systematically identify 28 major transit disruptions over the period of one year in Chicago and match them, both temporally and spatially, with ridesourcing trip data. Using multilevel mixed modeling, we quantify variation in the adaptive use of on-demand mobility across the racially and economically diverse city of Chicago. Our findings show that the gap-filling potential of adaptive ridesourcing during rail transit disruptions is significantly influenced by the station-, community-, and district-level factors. Specifically, greater shifts to ridesourcing occur during weekdays, nonholidays, and more severe disruptions, in community areas that have higher percentages of white residents and transit commuters, and in the more affluent North district of the city. These findings suggest that while ridesourcing appears to provide adaptive capacity during rail disruptions, its benefits do not appear to be equitable for lower-income communities of color that already experience limited mobility options.

Human mobility patterns were drastically adjusted as individuals complied with stay-at-home orders, changed their working patterns, and moved increasingly in the proximity of their home. Such behavioural changes brought about many spillover impacts, among which the sharp and immediate reduction in the concentration of nitrogen-based pollutants throughout the country. This work explores the extent to which urban Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) concentration responds to changes in human behaviour, in particular human mobility patterns and commuting. We model the dynamic and responsive change in NO2 concentration in the period directly following national lockdown and respective opening orders. Using the national urban air quality monitoring network we generate a synthetic NO2 concentration series built from a time series of historic data to compare expected modelled trends to the actual observed patterns in 2020. A series of pre- and post-estimators are modelled to understand the scale of concentration responsiveness to human activity and varying ability of areas across the UK to comply with the lockdown closing and response to openings. Specifically, these are linked to workday commuting times and observed patterns of human mobility change obtained from Google mobility reports. We find a strong and robust co-movement of air pollution concentration and work-related mobility - concentrations of NO2 during typical weekday commuting hours saw a higher relative drop, moving in tandem with patterns of human mobility around workplaces over the course of lockdowns and openings. While NO2 concentrations remained relatively low around the time of reopening, particularly during commuting hours, there is a relatively fast responsiveness rate to concentrations increasing quickly in line with human activity. With one of the key Government advice for workers to take staggered transportation into work and lessen the burden of rush hours and adopting more flexible work-home arrangements, our results would suggest that reductions in NO2 in urban areas are particularly responsive to broader human patterns and dynamics over time as we transitioned towards new working routines.",COVID-19,Air Pollution,Human Mobility,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have exerted efforts to measure the regularity in people's location visiting patterns. However, the complexity of travel behavior at different spatial and temporal scales has not been adequately considered. To capture regularity in a more comprehensive manner, we construct human mobility profiles with interpretable features at three levels, that is, location, motif, and route, on personal vehicle drivers. A feature engineering approach is designed to analyze the extent to which individuals exhibit multi-level regularity. The analysis pipeline includes feature selection, user segmentation and profiling, and feature importance evaluation. Our empirical study analyzed over 4 million trips of 3743 personal vehicle drivers collected over a month in six metropolitan areas in the United States. The weak correlations between features confirm the validity of quantifying regularity from different aspects. We discovered five clusters of drivers (i.e., gig drivers, homebodies, movers, typical drivers, and work-focused commuters) that differ in their regularity to commute to the workplace and the inclination to participate in non-work activities. A similar driver segmentation and profiling pattern is found in all of the studied metro areas. The minor differences are interpreted from the distribution of mobility features and urban features. The proposed method using multi-level feature engineering provides a generic framework to study regularity and can be readily adapted to other mobility data sources by customizing the features.

With the COVID-19 pandemic under control, the overly lenient measures allowed the new variant to take advantage. Also, it is difficult to determine the geographical scope of transport policy that has the least impact on work resumption. Therefore, it is necessary to find policies to promote work resumption while preventing and controlling the pandemic in a geographical perspective. In this paper, a framework based on mobile phone data is proposed for promoting work resumption during the pandemic. First, human mobility networks are constructed through the origin-destination flow extracted from mobile phone data. Second, the singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm is utilized to recognize the mobility patterns and explore the urban mobility dynamics of workresumption-related travel during the pandemic. Third, the nonoverlapping community detection algorithm is used to generate policy zoning for work-resumption-related travel. Finally, the policy zoning is validated by public health data based on the overlay analysis and spatial statistics method, and policy implications are proposed. A case study of Shanghai, China is applied to verify the proposed framework. The results show that the framework can capture the mobility patterns and implement the policy zoning based on mobile phone data to balance the economic activity and public health during the pandemic, and the proposed framework can be applied to other cities with future public health events.",COVID-19,Work resumption,Mobile phone data,Urban mobility dynamics,Singular value decomposition,Community detection,TRAVEL BEHAVIOR,PATTERNS,INDIVIDUALS,NETWORKS,OUTBREAK,DISEASE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To better understand people's experience of urban change and the emotional response associated with it, we led a descriptive qualitative study based on 32 semistructured interviews and a directed content analysis with people living in Montreal, Canada, and its suburbs. Changes to the urban environment were linked to both positive and negative emotions. Among all the physical and social changes reported, condominiums (""condos""), emerged as a prominent theme that elicited a strong emotional response.

While cities are eager to integrate cutting-edge technologies to evolve into digital and intelligent hubs, they often deal with infrastructure and governance bottlenecks that prevent the rapid adoption of industry-driven innovations. This study introduces a three-step methodological approach to forecast a city's innovation readiness in urban mobility, thus facilitating city-led innovation and identifying key areas within urban mobility systems that require attention. Initially, a comprehensive literature review was undertaken to ascertain the most impactful innovation indicators influencing a city's ability to embrace new technologies. Subsequently, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to identify these indicators, highlighting the primary markers of innovation for each city. The final step involved the application of both random and fixed-effects regression models to quantify the influence of distinct unobserved variables-such as economic, cultural, and political factors-on the innovation readiness of various cities. The methodology's effectiveness was tested using data from cities across diverse regions. The findings underscore that merely 7 out of 21 innovation indicators are critical for assessing a city's innovation readiness. Moreover, the random-effects model was identified as the most suitable for capturing the nuances of unobserved variables in the studied cities. The innovation readiness scores at the city level revealed a diverse range, with cities like Madrid, Gothenburg, and Mechelen demonstrating high readiness, while others like Kalisz and Datong showed lower scores. This research contributes to the strategic planning for smart cities, offering a robust framework for policymakers to enhance innovation readiness and foster sustainable urban development, with a newfound emphasis on city-specific analysis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Originally built for the German Democratic Republic's miners and energy workers, its model socialist New City attracted tens of thousands of people in the latter half of the 20th century. In the wake of German reunification, this direction of mobility reversed. Economic transformations resulted in widespread unemployment and subsequent outmigration. Mostly the young and well-educated left the city, as reunified Germany saw millions of East Germans move 'to the West'. Beyond outmigration, those staying behind continued to face their city's presumed loss of the future. However, widespread expectations of better futures elsewhere did not necessarily result in ever more people leaving. Futures elsewhere were contrasted to futures elsewhen: hopeful local futures different to the one of continuous decline so commonly predicted. Based on long-term ethnographic fieldwork, I explore these entangled practices of place- and future-making and map the different expectations of im/mobility that make up a surprisingly complex local regime of im/mobility.

Nowadays, while deep learning approaches are dominating the mobility prediction field where various model architectures/designs are continuously updating to push up the prediction accuracy, there naturally arises a question: whether these models are sufficiently good to reach the best possible prediction accuracy? To answer this question, predictability study is a method that quantifies the inherent regularities of the human mobility data and links the result to that limit. Mainstream predictability studies achieve this by analyzing the individual trajectories and merging all individual results to obtain an upper bound. However, the multiple individuals composing the city are not totally independent and the individual behavior is heavily influenced by its implicit or explicit surroundings. Therefore, the collective factor should be considered in the mobility predictability measurement, which has not been addressed before.

Due to carbon-intensive mobility, many developed countries implemented various place-based decarbonisation (PBD) strategies to develop sustainable city environments, but the adoption of PBD strategies in developing nations is still lagging. Electric vehicles (EVs) based mobilities are considered a PBD strategy to reduce city transport externalities. In addition, developing nations' transport users have various adoption uncertainties in adopting EVs-based urban mobility. Therefore, the present study focuses on under-standing transport users' preferences for adopting EVs-based mobility to promote decarbonization in multiple places in India. The proposed conceptual model is based on attribution theory to develop EVs' adoption intention and validate it with the users of different tier-1 cities of India. The PBD strategies of the considered cities differ entirely from developed cities of the world and have different EVs promotion strategies. A structured survey instrument is used to record 335 potential users' responses to validate the conceptual model. The proposed model's psychometric properties are analysed with the LISREL package of Structural Equation Modeling. The moderated-mediation model and proposed research model hypotheses are tested using PROCESS macro. The obtained results confirm two important relations; first, the EVs technical attributes mediated the relationship between users' financial attributes and psychological attributes for PBD mobility adoption; Second, financial attributes are positively related to psychological attributes for adopting EVs for users' PBD mobility. The other key finding of the research is that the financial attributes interacted with the existing EV infrastructure (first moderator) and familiarity (second moderator) to influence the technical attributes of EV adoption. Thus, the obtained results unfold the complex relationships among financial attributes, psychological attributes, technical attributes, EV infrastructure, and familiarity for developing positive intentions towards adopting EVs for city decarbonization. The above factors profoundly impact the psychological makeup of users, resulting in in-dividuals' purchasing intention of EVs for PBD.

Both in Europe and in the US, the pandemic arrived earlier and recorded higher Rt values in urban regions than in intermediate and rural ones. A similar gap is also found in the data on excess mortality. In the weeks during the first phase of the pandemic, urban regions in EU countries experienced excess mortality of up to 68 pp more than rural ones. We show that, during the initial days of the pandemic, territorial differences in Rt by the degree of urbanisation can be largely explained by the level of internal, inbound and outbound mobility. The differences in the spread of COVID-19 by rural-urban typology and the role of mobility are less clear during the second wave. This could be linked to the fact that the infection is widespread across territories, to changes in mobility patterns during the summer period as well as to the different containment measures which reverse the link between mobility and Rt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While UAM promises to introduce a new mode of transport, it depends on ground infrastructure to operate safely and efficiently in a highly constrained urban environment. Due to its novelty, the research of UAM ground infrastructure is widely scattered. Therefore, this paper selects, categorizes and summarizes existing literature in a systematic fashion and strives to support the harmonization process of contributions made by industry, research and regulatory authorities. Through a document term matrix approach, we identified 49 Scopus-listed scientific publications (2016-2021) addressing the topic of UAM ground infrastructure with respect to airspace operation followed by design, location and network, throughput and capacity, ground operations, cost, safety, regulation, weather and lastly noise and security. Last listed topics from cost onwards appear to be substantially under-represented, but will be influencing current developments and challenges.

We investigate to what extent the dynamics of international migration and internal mobility changed during the first waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to the previous decade. We focus on Austrian and Italian municipalities to assess the contribution of migration components to local population growth, using official data provided by National Statistical Institutes on inflows and outflows of migrant and native populations, from 2010 to 2020. The adoption of harmonized degrees of urbanization allows us to profile spatial and demographic patterns of mobility, in the Austrian and Italian territories. We apply Bayesian-Geostatistical models, and Artificial Neural-Networks to investigate the potential determinants of mobility variability. The results reveal Austrian and Italian population-specific migration trends. Overall, the trends observed in the decade before the pandemic were either confirmed or further accentuated during the COVID-19 era. Although rural-urban mobility generally persisted in both countries, counter-urbanization trends were detected among Austrian populations during the initial period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Conversely, urban and intermediate municipalities in Italy maintained their attractiveness and capacity to retain Italian populations. These findings offer new empirical insights into urbanization dynamics in a comparative perspective, which are particularly relevant for the definition of European regional policy aimed at matching local needs with national social cohesion goals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The paper draws on qualitative interviews (n = 48) and a travel survey (n = 2107) targeting economically active adults residing in peripheral neighborhoods. Their travel behavior is characterized by a high proportion of adults who regularly travel outside their neighborhoods, over relatively long distances (10+ km) and mainly using motorized transport.

This infrastructural intervention emerged from the state's humanitarian care approach, also known as a 'mobility fix'. Cycling lanes became an important mobility option for vulnerable social groups who continued to move around and became a manner that the government conferred public health solutions upon the individual. Therefore, as the city responded to daily urban mobility needs through cycling interventions, female cyclists used cycling infrastructures to move around. In an effort to understand these experiences, this article uses a feminist ethics framework to make sense of the spatial arrangement of non-traditional care-giving and care-receiving relations, between government and a group of friends. Drawing on mobile participatory research with ten female cyclists that focuses on their spatial practices, it finds that cycling lanes, along with municipal care campaigns, produced new minor caring acts, like kindness. Even as small caring acts emerged, female participants reported vulnerabilities, including the reproduction of toxic masculinity and dominance of automobility. The article finds that cycling infrastructures alone are incapable of protecting cyclists if larger socio-cultural dilemmas, such as gendered violence, go unaddressed within planning interventions. Ultimately, these findings contribute to debates within cycling geographic literature by expanding on care debates in cycling literature beyond an individual and household relation.",Care,cycling infrastructures,gendered cycling,pandemics,URBAN FRIENDSHIP,GEOGRAPHIES,MOBILITY,ETHICS,GENDER,TRANSPORTATION,RESPONSIBILITY,WOMEN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Researchers' insights suggest that densification can lead to better accessibility by reducing travel needs and distances, thus changing the modal split. However, lack of consistent transport policies, that accompany densification, can have side effects: increased congestion and pollution. Although analyses of the interaction between urban intensification and transportation planning have been conducted before, there is still a lack of knowledge of the form of that interaction in post-socialist cities. The process of emergence of the science and business district in Gdansk -a large, post-socialist city in Central Europe - provides an instructive subject for the analysis of this interaction. Descriptive and visual reconstruction of the land development and transport system performance, along with the analysis of strategic and planning documents, reveal inconsistencies in local policy and barriers to its implementation. A set of factors identified in the research indicates that the implementation of the accessibility and mobility strategies are deficient, leading to the disturbance of the balanced cycle model.

However, these innovations sometimes raise concerns, notably in terms of societal, safety, and environmental impacts. This is the case for services related to the operation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), which are emerging rapidly. Unmanned aerial vehicles, also called drones, date back to the first third of the twentieth century in aviation industry, when they were mostly used for military purposes. Nowadays, drones of various types and sizes are used for many purposes, such as precision agriculture, search and rescue missions, aerial photography, shipping and delivery, etc. Starting to operate in areas with low population density, drones are now looking for business in urban and suburban areas, in what is called urban air mobility (UAM). However, this rapid growth of the drone industry creates psychological fear of the unknown in some parts of society. Reducing this fear will play an important role in public acceptance of drone operations in urban areas. This paper presents the main concerns of society with regard to drone operations, as already captured in some public surveys, and proposes a list of mitigation measures to reduce these concerns. The proposed list is then analyzed, and its applicability to individual, urban, very large demonstration flights is explained, using the feedback from the CORUS-XUAM project.

The possible influence of several meteorological factors (temperature, wind, pressure, and humidity), and mobility on the pollutants' levels were also considered. The obtained results showed a positive correlation of daily NO2 concentrations with mobility and its significant reduction during restrictive measures at all selected monitoring stations. The reduction of NO2 was higher than in other countries (71.1-111.5% for measured, and 49.3-92.6% for ""deweathered"" data), indicating a high traffic impact on NO2 levels in Serbia. The PM, CO, and SO2 showed a weak correlation with mobility during the period with restrictive measures, which, besides traffic, indicates the significant influence of other sources of their concentration. The O-3 concentrations were increased at all measuring stations and are negatively correlated to mobility. Comparison of pollutant concentrations during restriction with the equivalent period in preceding years showed reductions in NO2 and SO2 concentrations. However, compared to previous years, the concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, and CO increased in the period with restrictive measures, indicating lower sensitivity to population mobility and higher dependence on other emission sources.

As such, these four locations have become the primary employment destinations for recent college graduates. Meanwhile, these cities have the most stringent hukou policies nationwide, which play a key role in the urban labour market segmentation between local residents and in-migrants. Using three waves of data from a nationally representative survey, the China College Student Survey (2010, 2013, and 2015), this paper, for the first time, examined whether Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen have emerged as an 'upward social class escalator region' for young adults in China. After accounting for observed demographic and human capital characteristics and migrant selectivity, migrating into Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen has been found to be positively associated with earnings attainment, and the economic benefit from relocation is greater than that experienced by migrants elsewhere in the system. However, in-migrants to Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen have fewer opportunities to enter government organisations and public enterprises. These results cast doubt on the potential for Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen to act as escalators for individuals wishing to achieve all-around upwards social mobility in China's urban labour market. The local hukou barrier may still be a salient factor in shaping migrants' labour market outcomes in China.

Nonetheless, as this influx of app-based drivers has hit the city's streets, specific livelihood and mobility frictions have emerged, notably with informal, 'traditional' motorbike taxi drivers, or xe om. In this paper we analyse these evolving sites and moments of friction and their impacts on driver livelihoods and mobilities for both driver groups. We draw conceptually on debates regarding mobility, platform economies, and urban livelihoods, while specifically interrogating the concept of friction to highlight three possible analytical applications. Methodologically, we interpret static and ride-along interviews completed with over 130 drivers. We highlight a range of tactics 'traditional' and app-based motorbike taxi drivers have employed to respond to rising frictions, defend their 'turf', and maintain their street-based livelihoods. Driver responses reveal differing access to distinctive forms of social capital and social networks, and contrasting levels of agency regarding their mobilities. By conceptually teasing apart the notion of friction, we wish to expand and deepen understandings of the experiences of vulnerability, precarity, and other impacts of platformisation for different motorbike taxi driver cohorts.",friction,mobility,platform livelihoods,urban informality,Vietnam,CHI-MINH CITY,LABOR,MIGRATION,TRANSPORT,POLITICS,SERVICES,WORK,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relation between urban form and sustainable transport has been discussed by academics and practitioners and there is a consensus that specific parameters of urban form can encourage walking and discourage car use. Following global recommendations on sustainable development, countries take steps towards strengthening pedestrian accessibility by implementing spatial characteristics of walkable neighbourhoods, but also by mobility and urban design strategies. This issue, however, is not properly recognised in countries with short experience in sustainable urban development, such as former socialist countries. In Poland no studies on walkability-related parameters of urban form have been carried out, hence the knowledge in this field is limited. This paper aims to address this gap by providing evidence of a newly built urban district located in Gdansk, Poland. We present the Polish case with three examples of new urban districts from Western Europe, that are designed as sustainable and walkable environments. The methodology is based on the descriptive case study. It includes characteristics of design parameters namely the components of the ""walkability index"" as well as mobility solutions and urban design guidelines. The results show the current position of Garnizon development in relation to the Western European cases with regard to the existing post-communist legacy and allow for indicating differences and possible shortcomings.

Research on urban diversity commonly focuses on ethnicities and countries of origin, disregarding equally informative characteristics, such as information on languages and language use, which might reveal new aspects of urban diversity. In this paper, we analyse the development of urban diversity in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area between 1987 and 2019 using language information retrieved from the Finnish population register and examine the extent to which linguistic diversity captures urban diversity. We focus on two population groups, speakers of Estonian and Somali, to analyse how linguistic diversity and socioeconomic characteristics have changed in their residential neighbourhoods and to estimate to what extent these population groups have integrated into the host society. We measured linguistic diversity using Shannon entropy, performed spatial clustering analyses and used Markov chains to examine the likelihood of changes in linguistic diversity. We found clear spatial patterns and high spatial variability in the development of linguistic diversity, which shows that geographical space is a central component in linguistic diversity. Our results suggest that linguistic diversity is more likely to change in more segregated neighbourhoods and show that linguistic diversity is a suitable proxy for urban diversity.

However, the uncertainty of human mobility patterns and the complexity of urban transportation systems usually yield challenges in accurately estimating the travel flux within a city. Thus, we propose a novel travel flux estimation method that integrates traffic flow characteristics (traffic volume and travel time), spatio-temporal autocorrelation, and travel purpose correlation. First, the geographically weighted method was used to model and verify the spatio-temporal autocorrelation of origin-destination flows, whereas the purpose correlation of origin-destination flows was expressed through the function feature vectors of urban blocks. Then, a multi-objective bi-level programming model, according to the generalized least squares method, was constructed to estimate the travel flux between blocks. This was used to solve the problem of accurate estimation of travel flux by combining microscopic traffic flow characteristics with macroscopic spatio-temporal and purpose characteristics. Finally, an empirical analysis of the Hankou district, Wuhan City, demonstrated that in contrast to the existing method, the accuracy of the proposed method for predicting the human travel flux improved by approximately 20%. The estimated results were consistent with the spatial distribution pattern of human travel.

Consequently, the local transport system underwent significant changes, including a number of interventions aimed explicitly at regularizing cycle-rickshaw mobilities.

This paper presents an air route design scheme for multi-rotor UAVs in urban airspace to enable UAV operations at orderly levels. The air routes include legs and intersections, which are the three-dimensional channels of UAV flight. Based on the concept of structured and layered urban airspace, the cylindrical pipeline flight leg is designed, and the operation concept, characteristic parameters and flight procedures of along-road and roundabout intersections are proposed. By defining UAV conflict risk and intersection service level metrics, the operation situation of UAVs is quantitatively evaluated. Taking an urban transportation scenario as a case, the proposed route design scheme is simulated in different scale UAV operating scenarios. The results show that the number of UAVs at the intersection is positively correlated with the conflict probability, the number of crossing routes is negatively correlated with the intersection passing rate, and the UAV arrival rate is positively correlated with the intersection average passing time. The along-road type intersection is suitable for the area with fewer crossing routes and sparse UAVs, while the roundabout type intersection is adapted for the area with more crossing routes and dense UAVs.

The Meta-LSTM is applied to the URT network of Nanning, Hangzhou, and Beijing, China. The experiments on three real-world URT networks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Meta-LSTM over several competitive baseline models.

People, when walking in particular, are at risk of experiencing heat stress as they navigate urban environments. This study proposes a novel heat risk assessment framework combining pedestrian mobility modeling with urban microclimate modeling. Using this framework, we assessed pedestrian heat-related exposure and risk in urban areas by integrating the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) as the hazard and pedestrian trips to critical destinations as exposure. We considered temporal variation, in both hazard and exposure, by examining different time periods during the day-morning peak, midday, and evening peak. In addition to hazard and exposure, we also considered vulnerability by focusing on young children and older adults. We contribute to improving the spatial resolution of heat risk assessment by analyzing the hazard for pedestrian trips between home locations and five critical destinations-bus stops, rail stations, parks, schools, and commercial amenities-at the address-point level and using a pedestrian network comprising sidewalks and crosswalks. Our framework helps identify sidewalks with high heat exposure levels as well as home locations with high cumulative heat risk, accounting for walking trips to critical destinations along feasible routes. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this framework by applying it to a 36-square-kilometer area of central Los Angeles, CA. Our findings offer valuable information to urban planners and policy-makers, supporting evidence-based prioritization of intervention sites, climate adaptation strategies, and policy decisions essential for climate-proof planning.

However, the diversity of people is a challenging concept to operationalize within the context of urban spaces, which is why many evaluations of urban space have relied primarily on density-based measures. We argue that a focus on only one of the two aspects misses important aspects of the variety of urban spaces in our cities. To address this, we design a methodology that evaluates both the density and diversity of human behavior in urban spaces based on geosocial media data. We operationalize density as the frequency of tweets from visitors to a particular location and diversity as the variety of the home neighborhoods of those visitors. Taking Singapore as a test case, we identify networks between the home neighborhoods of 28k Twitter users based on 2.2 million geolocated tweets collected between 2012 and 2016. Based on these data, we categorize the urban landscape of Singapore into four ""performance"" categories, namely High-Density/High-Diversity, High-Density/Low-Diversity, Low-Density/High-Diversity, and Low-Density/Low-Diversity. Our findings illustrate that this combined indicator provides useful nuance compared to differentiation between well and less performing spaces based on density alone. By enabling a categorization of urban spaces that fits closer to the diversity of human behavior in these spaces, human mobility data sets, such as the social media data we use, open the door to a practical evaluation of the design and planning of our heterogeneous urban environment.",urban spaces categorization,human behavior,density-diversity visitors,social media data,HUMAN MOBILITY,INEQUALITY,TWITTER,DESIGN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the effects of combining datasets of varying quality have not been thoroughly analyzed. In addition, human mobility patterns from social sensing data, which capture signals of human activities, are often represented by origin-destination pairs, thus ignoring spatial relationships between UFZs embedded in mobility trajectories. To address the aforementioned issues, this study proposed a graph-based UFZ classification framework that fuses semantic features from high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing images, points of interest, and GPS trajectory data. The framework involves three main steps: (1) High-level scene information in HSR remote sensing imageries was extracted through deep neural networks, and multisource semantic embeddings were constructed based on physical features and social sensing features from multiple geospatial data sources; (2) UFZ mobility graph was constructed by spatially joining trajectory information with UFZs to construct topological connections between functional parcel segments; and (3) UFZ segments and multisource semantic features were transformed into nodes and embeddings in the mobility graphs, and subsequently graph-based models were adopted to identify UFZs. The proposed framework was tested on Zhuhai and Singapore datasets. Results indicated that it outperformed traditional classification methods with an overall accuracy of 76.7% and 84.5% for Zhuhai and Singapore datasets, respectively.

In total, 26 older adults and 7 PWDs were recruited for go-along interviews in localities familiar to them in Singapore. These semi-structured go-alongs generated a wealth of qualitative data covering topics ranging from their travel patterns to their perceptions of the built environment and their attitudes towards space sharing. Interview transcripts, field notes and video footage enabled an in-depth analysis of both the verbal and nonverbal aspects of the active mobility behaviour. The analysis revealed emerging sociospatial themes, including movement within an extended pedestrian network, such as detouring and taking shortcuts, and ambivalence towards space sharing caused in part by unclear rights-of-way among active transport modes and preconceptions of social norms. These themes have implications for how to shape travel behaviour based on a more inclusive approach to urban planning and neighbourhood design that instils a deeper humanistic understanding.",Go-along interview,Active mobility,Inclusive streets,Accessibility,Older adults,People with disabilities,IRVINE-MINNESOTA INVENTORY,MEASURE BUILT ENVIRONMENTS,PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY,WALKING,TRANSPORT,WALKABILITY,SENIORS,ACCESSIBILITY,PERCEPTIONS,BEHAVIOR,,,,,,,,,,

Multilevel regression models were used to verify how individual and contextual variables influence the dynamics of urban mobility. The hypothesis that there are statistically significant differences between the duration of the trip and the number of trips made in the city of São Paulo, when comparing men and women, was not rejected. Being a woman implies a longer average trip duration and a smaller number of trips to reach the destination of interest, in relation to the estimates obtained for male individuals.

Human mobility profoundly influences our daily lives, impacting transportation systems, urban planning, logistics, and healthcare. While AI methods have made significant advancements in addressing human mobility challenges, they often struggle with the complexity and dynamic nature of this domain. The limitations arise from the narrow focus of existing AI systems, lacking the ability to generalize and adapt to new situations. To overcome these limitations, there is a growing interest in developing AGI systems. This paper explores the potential of AGI to revolutionize human mobility research by enabling systems to understand, learn, reason, and adapt across diverse domains and tasks. To achieve this goal, we propose the Mobility Foundation Model (MFM) and the concept of an intermediate modality is further introduced as a means to bridge the gap between different mobility modalities and scales. The unified representation allows the MFM to effectively learn and integrate information from various modalities. We also present a novel MFM as Administrator paradigm for leveraging MFM in complex mobility tasks.

Recognizing this challenge, this research addresses the adverse effects of traffic lights on the energy efficiency of electric vehicles (EVs) through the introduction of a Multi-Intersections-Based Eco-Approach and Departure strategy (M-EAD). This innovative strategy is designed to enhance various aspects of urban mobility, including vehicle energy efficiency, traffic flow optimization, and battery longevity, all while ensuring a satisfactory driving experience. The M-EAD strategy unfolds in two distinct stages: First, it optimizes eco-friendly green signal windows at traffic lights, with a primary focus on minimizing travel delays by solving the shortest path problem. Subsequently, it employs a receding horizon framework and leverages an iterative dynamic programming algorithm to refine speed trajectories. The overarching objective is to curtail energy consumption and reduce battery wear by identifying the optimal speed trajectory for EVs in urban environments. Furthermore, the research substantiates the real-world efficacy of this approach through on-road vehicle tests, attesting to its viability and practicality in actual road scenarios. In the proposed case, the simulation results showcase notable achievements, with energy consumption reduced by 0.92% and battery wear minimized to a mere 0.0017%. This research, driven by the pressing issue of urban traffic energy efficiency, not only presents a solution in the form of the M-EAD strategy but also contributes to the fields of sustainable urban mobility and EV performance optimization.

This study presents a quantitative assessment of the impact of improper development of urban residential layouts on road infrastructure. The study developed an index for assessing the road infrastructure within residential layouts based on identifying the deficiencies which affect mobility and accessibility. A road infrastructure development index (RIDI) was conceptualized using an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and parameters that affect accessibility and commuter comfort in residential layouts derived from high-resolution satellite data. The parameters used to generate this RIDI were the number of approach roads, spatial road serviceability, road density, bottlenecks, population density, dead ends or cul-de-sacs, and road width. Sample layouts were selected from varying built-up land-use classes to extract the index parameters to develop the RIDI. The RIDI values estimated for sample layouts indicate the level of development of road infrastructure in the residential layouts. A case study of the Nagpur urban area in central India, showing estimated RIDI values, is discussed.

In addition, the Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated the already existing inequalities, further limiting older adults' mobility to carry out regular activities such as buying groceries, socialising, making a hospital visit, or going to work due to the fear of getting infected.ConclusionOur findings indicate that the use of public transport needs to be encouraged among older adults by enhancing necessary safety features following the age-friendly cities framework. Furthermore, it can help policymakers develop transport polices, which suit the mobility needs of older adults.",Older adults,Perceptions of safety,Public transportation,Non-motorized transport,Mobility,DRIVING CESSATION,HEALTH,IMPACT,WALKING,CRIME,SERVICES,PEOPLE,FEAR,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I argue that the media outlets that are commonly drawn on to identify best practices remain located within the global North, obscuring opportunities to conceptualize urban planning from within the context of the South. To theorize my arguments, I position myself within the government department of the Laboratorio para la Ciudad (Laboratory for the City, or LabCDMX) in Mexico City, a local nexus for best practice adoption. I make the case that decision makers frequently use best practices reported on in the English-language media, such as blogs and newspapers, including The New York Times and CityLab.

A framework which includes 11 factors is presented and applied to the different uses of the modal split indicator. Besides the comparison of the three main uses of modal split in research and practice, this contribution focuses on a citizen science project (Straatvinken) in the region of Flanders, Belgium. In this project thousands of citizens carry out traffic counts. While the project was initially set up to monitor modal split targets in the urban area of Antwerp, the emphasis shifted towards street liveability. This is visible in the fact that the citizen science project added a narrative-based liveability survey to capture experiences with and evaluations of the liveability at street level. The case illustrates that citizen science is, besides a tool to address data gaps, also an approach to increase the validity of indicators. The reason is that citizen science, which seems to be underexplored in transport studies, differs in what gets measured, how it is measured and why. This approach has proven to provide a fine-grained, integrated assessment of street-level changes in the composition and intensity of the traffic and their effects on the perceived liveability. We argue that it strengthens and complements traditional modal split measurements at the regional or urban level, which typically rely on the modelling of individual mobility behaviour based on household travel surveys. Traditional approaches allow observing broad trends in mobility choices at the regional level, but they do not provide insights in how those individual choices translate into effects at street level. Although often initiated out of certain sustainability concerns, existing modal split models do not reveal how an observed modal shift at the regional level affects the perceived liveability or sustainability at street level.",Citizen science,Sustainable urban mobility,Transport indicators,Modal split,Liveable streets,LIVABLE STREETS,COMMUNITY SEVERANCE,TRANSPORT,QUALITY,PEOPLE,POLICY,CITIES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spatial community detection has been proven to be an NP-Hard problem. Heuristic algorithms were widely used for detecting spatial communities. However, the spatial communities identified by existing heuristic algorithms are usually locally optimal and unstable. To alleviate these limitations, this study developed a hybrid heuristic algorithm by combining multi-level merging and consensus clustering. We first constructed a weighted spatially embedded network with road segments as vertices and the numbers of vehicle trips between the road segments as weights. Then, to jump out of the local optimum trap, a new multi-level merging approach, i.e., iterative local moving and global perturbation, was proposed to optimize the objective function (i.e., modularity) until a maximum of modularity was obtained. Finally, to obtain a representative and reliable spatial community structure, consensus clustering was performed to generate a more stable spatial community structure out of a set of community detection results. Experiments on Beijing taxi trajectory data show that the proposed method outperforms a state-of-the-art method, spatially constrained Leiden (Scleiden), because the proposed method can escape from the local optimum solutions and improve the stability of the identified spatial community structure. The spatial communities identified by the proposed method can reveal the polycentric structure and human mobility patterns in Beijing, which may provide useful references for human-centric urban planning.",spatial community,spatial optimization,consensus clustering,vehicle movements,urban sensing,URBAN,NETWORKS,PATTERNS,MOBILITY,USAGE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied recreational running during the dark season in Sweden, based on diary-interviews with thirty runners, employing practice theory and affordance theory to explore how places, practices, and affordances characterize running during this season. Our findings reveal ways in which runners engage in different running practices in different settings, with the forest, pavement, and hills as our examples, and with lights as an additional analytical lens. We show how runners, in their strategies for dealing with the dark season in a city, tend to avoid some characteristics of the city (traffic, noise) while taking advantage of others (street illumination, road, and pavement maintenance).

In 2020, the global spread of COVID-19 challenged urban life, raising questions about the prospects for digital mobility platforms. Pandemic restrictions resulted in dramatic changes in mobility patterns globally, including significant declines in demand for ride hailing. Concurrently, with restaurants closed to indoor and outdoor dining for extended periods in many cities around the world, restaurateurs worked diligently to adjust their business models. During the early days of the COVID-19 lockdown, ride hailing firms such as Uber shifted their efforts from moving people to moving food and other goods.

The main findings are that the transportation function is the top priority, followed by the public space function. Other functions, such as retail, services, and multimodal mobility, are less preferred by residents.

Human mobility data, such as mobile phone data and social media check-ins, enable the tracking of human movements, thus facilitating the transition of central flow theory from theoretical constructs to empirical research. To this end, this study presents an alternative data-driven framework to reveal the multi-scale spatial synergy of mega-city regions from a human mobility perspective.

The scholarship about this site has typically not centered on women's experiences, knowledge, and lives, in narrating the overwhelming sacred rhetoric of the city. This paper contributes to the extant scholarship on gender, risk, corporeality, and urbanity by establishing a dialogue between risk theories embedded in institutional management discourse, emerging from Western contexts, and the lived and embodied risk practices of women in the global South.

The previous studies have utilized intercity relational data (e.g., population migration (PM), goods trade, and information exchange) to build up urban connections directly. Besides, the nighttime light (NTL) data have also been adopted to simulate a dynamic urban intercity flow. However, the relevant studies have not clearly defined the urban spatial interaction based on the NTL data. To answer this question, we used trial-and-error testing to define the NTL-based interaction. First, five traditional urban interactions were selected as the potential definitions, including PM, transfer of innovation, information flow (IF), financial flow, and urban composite interaction (CI). Second, as usual, the NTL-based urban interaction, named the NTL interaction (NTLI) index, was simulated based on the NPP-VIIRS-like NTL data and the radiation model. Taking the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomerations (YRDUAs) as an example, we found that the NTL-based urban interaction is more like the PM at the urban agglomeration scale and the provincial scale with R-2 of 0.71 and 0.59, respectively. In addition to this, the NTLI index has a weak correlation with the transfer of patent (TP) index, IF index, economic interaction (EI) index, and CI index. To sum up, the interaction network from NTL data can be an adequate proxy of urban population interaction, rather than the knowledge network or economic network.

We exemplify this through consideration of Singapore's exceptionalism as a city-state, and what this means for its capacity for global self-promotion as an urban policy model. When the city-state selectively decides to engage among 'peer cities' in city-based institutional venues like city networks, it does so within a hierarchical logic dominated by the political authority and decision-making powers that derive from its capacity for and interest in entertaining relations with other sovereign nation-states. Through a counterfactual logic, Singapore's outstanding transnational urban position reveals the current constraints of city diplomacy, as other merely city-level governments are compelled to join forces transnationally within a logic framed in terms of (lack of) access to state-centric institutional venues and resources. For the overwhelming majority of city governments, in contrast to Singapore, city networks are obligatory passage points to bypass traditional policy scales. Extending a theoretical bridge between the bodies of literature on urban policy mobilities and city networks, the article excavates Singapore's 'privileged' position to deepen our understanding of the relationship between the city and the state.

There have been calls to develop new conceptual language geared to this challenge and much debate around the degree to which it might be subsumed within global urban theory. We argue that theories of informal urbanism need to be grounded in an understanding of how it works to sustain livelihoods, moving beyond studies of informal settlement, street vending and transport to understand the synergies, interrelations and interdependencies between them. Informal vending and transport provide employment and produce cheap goods and mobility; informal settlement produces affordable housing in key locations with access and mobility. 'Inventraset' is a portmanteau concept that links informal vending, transport and settlement into a dynamic urban assemblage that is inventive, transgressive and settled. This model is demonstrated through an empirical study of the spatial logic of the inventraset triangle within the megacities of Manila and Jakarta. Here the informal is normal, whether displayed in the intensities of transit nodes and street markets or camouflaged within zones of exclusion. This is not an 'informal city' but one where informal street vending, transport and settlement are geared to formal spatial and governance structures in different ways in different neighbourhoods - an assemblage of informal/formal and of vending/transport/settlement without which the urban economy would collapse.

Second, being left behind lends understanding for why many rural youth migrate out of a rural village, and how this directs the hopes and investments of rural families' in urban centres.

Developing models for infection transmission and mitigation in metropolises is a challenging problem because of spatiotemporal variations in their population structures. Employing the fact that intra-urban mobility is mainly shaped by the transportation infrastructure and reflected in the traffic flux information, a novel multi-scale reaction-diffusion process is developed to model infection transmission in a metropolis.To mitigate the infection, the impact of three non-pharmaceutical preventive interventions (movement restrictions, social distancing, and proactive testing/screening) is analytically investigated on the reaction-diffusion process. We show that imposing movement restrictions between sub-urban areas is only beneficial when they have different reproduction numbers. The social distancing reduces the infection peak in sub-urban areas, but its impact on the entire metropolis is various: The social distancing reduces a metropolis's infection peak if its implementation disperses the reproduction number of sub-urban areas. We show that allocation schemes of proactive testing/screening teams to sub-urban areas have intractable impacts on the infection peak. This demonstrates the necessity of employing optimization techniques to design the best allocation scheme.Finally, three mathematical models and their solution approaches are developed to optimize the implementation of the interventions with the least economic burden.

The formation of new cities is also theorized as occurring through the migration of people. However, recent scholarship implies that parts of India may be witnessing an urbanization process that depends on natural population growth rather than in-migration. This claim carries significant implications for urban theory, but it has never been tested empirically. This article addresses that gap by examining migration patterns in India alongside urbanization-measured in terms of densification of population and built-up area and an economic transition away from agriculture. I find that certain parts of the country, notably the eastern Indo-Gangetic Plain, are exhibiting all the trends constitutive of urbanization even as they experience negative net migration-a phenomenon I term ""urbanization from within."" My analysis also highlights that these same regions see high rates of temporary out-migration-suggesting that human mobilities may play a role in the in situ urbanization of rural settlements, but not in the ways that foundational urban and development theories would predict. I discuss the inequalities of India's economic transition and its spatial regime of social welfare as possible causal underpinnings of the trends I observe.

This study focuses on measuring the level of accessibility to public transport, particularly for urban areas in Marrakech. Spatial analyses using GIS were conducted on a geodatabase containing bus stops and routes to determine travel duration, service area, and accessibility to nearby destinations. Revealing that approximately 62% of destinations have no access to bus services, while 0.73% have excellent access. Furthermore, a correlation analysis between the accessibility index and the frequency of the public transport system highlighted a decrease in accessibility as bus frequency decreased. Areas with low-frequency bus service faced challenges, emphasizing the impact of frequency on overall accessibility.

Yet, little is known about how children's everyday recreation and associated mobilities are affected by planning projects and densification processes, where ideas of sustainable mobility often focus on a transit-oriented development (TOD) based on densification in areas around transport nodes. In this study, we examine the current rapid development of a small town in the south of Sweden, affected by TOD ideals. The case is studied through the perspectives of local children aged 10-11, focusing on their recreational mobilities and the current development, using walking interviews. The children described the current projects as happening fast, diminishing their spaces and increasing car traffic without their perspectives being included. Compared to a study conducted 5 years earlier in the same small town, the children appeared to find less places for them and to focus more on formal places programmed for their use. There are reasons to be critical to how densification is being realised in relation to sustainable recreational mobilities, if leading to continuous car dependence but with less access to sufficient and varied open spaces of interest to children.

This method was applied to urban and rural areas with 4062 buildings in 70 census block groups.

Second, I argue that waiting is a method offering possibilities for understanding the Sisyphean task of cleaning and uneven, precarious, and diverse urban worlds. Waiting is integral to maintenance work, and pivotal to the production of ""clean"" infrastructures, yet it remains invisible. Third, I posit waiting as praxis: a mode of field work grappling with place-based realities. Waiting is learning the station. My article considers the social and economic (im)mobilities that underpin the waiting of cleaning workers. I further posit queues as microinfrastructures of waiting. Finally, I argue that waiting, when employed as a method, and as praxis, reveals the uneven urban worlds, relational spaces, and the everydayness of capitalism.",Indian railways,labor,India,infrastructure,mobilities,Swachh Bharat (Clean India),waiting,MAINTENANCE,INFRASTRUCTURE,INFORMALITY,REPAIR,SPACE,STATE,TIME,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies on the accessibility of UGS under the two-step floating catchment (2SFCA) framework have recently received much attention. However, the effects of people's actual mobility patterns have not been fully considered in current studies. Proposed in this study is an improved accessibility model called AM-Ga2SFCA, which refines the traditional Gaussian 2SFCA method with the actual mobility information extrac-ted from mobile phone big data and online map. A new attractiveness index of UGS is implemented by combining the popularity evaluated by the PageRank algorithm and the actual utilisation based on buffer analysis. In addition, realistic travel time between each demand point and UGS is retrieved from the online map, which is further introduced into AM-Ga2SFCA as the travel cost. A case study is conducted in Shenzhen, China to validate the proposed model. Results show that the accessibility of UGS is strongly correlated with regional urbanization level, for example, higher accessibility generally occurred in the region with developed transportation and rich green resources. From the perspective of age groups and travel modes, we found that the environmental justice issue had already occurred in Shenzhen especially for the non-elderly: under the walk mode, nearly 80% of the non-elderly only shared 20% of UGS whilst approximately 80% of the elderly shared 30% of UGS. However, taxi or private vehicles can effectively alleviate the aforementioned phenomenon by reducing the Gini index to less than 0.5.

Informal transport provides the bulk of urban mobility in the Global South but may be limited in the connectivity and spatial coverage it is able to provide. I tested the effectiveness of market response by temporarily subsidizing operations in an unserved location and found that even a limited expansion of routing found passenger demand, showing a countercurrent of travel against the existing pattern of radial, central business district-to-suburb travel. Female street vendors were a particularly important previously unserved group of passengers. For operators, the study revealed that establishing new services can be difficult, requiring organizational capacity and substantial investment and risk in terms of time and money. In parallel, when such investments are made, other formal and informal actors, such as police, government bureaucracy, and competing operators, can act to extract the benefits, further slowing the change and growth of the transport network.Takeaway for practiceI describe the implementation steps and lessons learned from a small-scale pilot project that could be scaled for use as a planning intervention as well as to assess the equity of market-driven public transport and identify mobility gaps.

Nevertheless, there is no information on how these transportation projects will impact overall and relative accessibility for different population groups, especially those with current low accessibility. This study proposes a rigorous and replicable methodology to measure the impact of public transport projects on the overall accessibility and accessibility gap to urban opportunities for different socioeconomic groups. The methodology comprises three main phases: i) the characterization of accessibility to urban opportunities through public transport; ii) the measurement of the accessibility gap between socioeconomic groups, and iii) the impact of the metro's implementation on accessibility and the gap. All the procedures were implemented using open-source software and publicly available data, guaranteeing transparency and replicability. We applied this methodology to analyze the impact of implementing the First Metro Line (PLMQ) in Quito, Ecuador. The results show that the PLMQ will increase overall accessibility to urban opportunities, and this impact depends on travel time and current accessibility levels. The impact of the PLMQ on the accessibility gap will be more modest, and the benefits will be more important at long travel times.

Migrants prefer destinations with better welfare, land availability and intensity of economic activity. We also find that migrants prefer shorter distances and those destinations with better urban amenities and infrastructure. However, responses vary by type of migrant and migration. For example, rural-rural migrants are more responsive to land availability and agricultural potential, while rural-urban and urban-urban migrants are more responsive to welfare and economic vibrancy (measured by nightlight intensity) in destinations. Distance induces varying impact on migration choices of poor and non-poor migrants as well as across more educated and less educated migrants. Longer distances discourage migration for female migrants, poorer migrants, and less educated migrant while the implication for the non-poor and more educated migrants appears to be negligible. This is intuitive because poorer and less educated migrants have liquidity constraints to finance high migration costs.

The study located six different mobility practices and found a positive interest in the use of SAVs among people who adhere to a shared mobility type of practice, while the resistance was strongest among people who adhere to different car-based mobility practices. Also, those whose current mobility practice involves the use of electric cars had little interest in replacing their cars with SAVs.

However, cities are not adequately prepared to meet the needs of this population. Urban areas are predominantly oriented towards capital, prioritizing commerce and automobile traffic. This raises questions about the possibility of fully exercising the right to the city and, consequently, citizenship, mediated by urban mobility, a moment in which individuals interact more with the environment and establish interpersonal connections. From the standpoint of a critical epistemology, there is an urgency for a theoretical reconstruction of the right to the city, grounded in the child's perspective, through an extended case study. In this context, the experience of children residing in Ilha de Deus, in Recife, was analysed The research revealed that the realization of child citizenship through the right to the city, considering it as a claimable right, cannot be fully achieved without state legal support. The right of children to the city requires the backing of public policies aimed at addressing the demands of this age group. Similarly, it is essential to demonstrate the appropriation of urban space according to the child-specific characteristics, through affordances and urban mobility focused on this population.",Right of the child to the city,Public administration,Sociology of childhood,Child urban mobility,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This approach marks a paradigm shift in network invulnerability simulation: moving from network topology characteristics to a humancentric approach, which helps better identify vulnerable zones. The model's robustness is corroborated through simulations of major disaster scenarios. The results indicate that: 1) High-precision human mobility data promises large-scale urban supply-demand network modeling with high accuracy. 2) In regions characterized by greater vulnerability, the establishment of local supply networks demonstrates efficacy in mitigating the impacts of minor disasters. 3) During various stages of cascading failure, the leading factors contributing to community supply shortages vary, with population density being the predominant factor.

This work uses spatiotemporal aggregated mobile phone data provided by a major French telecom operator, covering a geographical region centered on Paris for early 2020, i.e., periods before and during the first French lockdown. An essential property of this data is its fine-grained spatial resolution, which, to the best of our knowledge, is unique in the COVID-related mobility literature. Contrarily to regions or country-wide resolution, it describes population mobility flows among zones ranging from 0.025~km2 to 5.40~km2, corresponding to 326 aggregated zones over the total area of 93.76~km2 of the city of Paris. We perform a data-driven mobility investigation and modeling to quantify (in space and time) the population attendance and visiting flows in different urban areas. Second, when looking at periods both before and during the lockdown, we quantify the consequences of mobility restrictions and decisions on an urban scale. For this, per zone, we define a so-called signature, which captures behaviors in terms of population attendance in the corresponding geographical region (i.e., their land use) and allows us to automatically detect activity, residential, and outlier areas. We then study three different types of graph centrality, quantifying the importance of each zone in a time-dependent weighted graph according to the habits in the mobility of the population. Combining the three centrality measures, we compute per zone of the city, its impact-factor, and employ it to quantify the global importance of zones according to the population mobility. Our results firstly reveal the population's daily zone preferences in terms of attendance and mobility, with a high concentration on business and touristic zones. Second, results show that the lockdown mobility restrictions significantly reduced visitation and attendance patterns on zones, mainly in central Paris, and considerably changed the mobility habits of the population. As a side effect, most zones identified as mainly having activity-related population attendance in typical periods became residential-related zones during the lockdown, turning the entire city into a residential-like area. Shorter distance displacement restrictions imposed by the lockdown increased visitation to more ""local"" zones, i.e., close to the population's primary residence. Decentralization was also favored by the paths preferences of the still-moving population. On the other side, ""jogging activities"" allowing people to be outside their residences impacted parks visitation, increasing their visitation during the lockdown. By combining the impact factor and the signatures of the zones, we notice that areas with a higher impact factor are more likely to maintain regular land use during the lockdown.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigate the drivers of dengue incidence and emergence in Vietnam, through analysing 23 years of district-level case data spanning a period of significant socioeconomic change (1998-2020). We show that urban infrastructure factors (sanitation, water supply, long-term urban growth) predict local spatial patterns of dengue incidence, while human mobility is a more influential driver in subtropical northern regions than the endemic south. Temperature is the dominant factor shaping dengue's distribution and dynamics, and using long-term reanalysis temperature data we show that warming since 1950 has expanded transmission risk throughout Vietnam, and most strongly in current dengue emergence hotspots (e.g., southern central regions, Ha Noi). In contrast, effects of hydrometeorology are complex, multi-scalar and dependent on local context: risk increases under either short-term precipitation excess or long-term drought, but improvements in water supply mitigate drought-associated risks except under extreme conditions. Our findings challenge the assumption that dengue is an urban disease, instead suggesting that incidence peaks in transitional landscapes with intermediate infrastructure provision, and provide evidence that interactions between recent climate change and mobility are contributing to dengue's expansion throughout Vietnam.The geographic distribution of dengue has been expanding in recent decades, and Vietnam is one of the most severely affected countries.

Location choice is a discrete choice decision, whereas mobility has a continuous time dimension. Since households relocate along their life course for different reasons such as the birth of a child, these reasons could influence the duration of stay as competing events. This paper develops a joint model for mobility and location choice decisions. Data come from a retrospective survey conducted in the Central Okanagan of British Columbia, Canada. A reason-based competing hazard model is developed for the mobility component of the joint model. For the location choice component, a latent segmentation-based logit model is developed to capture unobserved heterogeneity. The influence of location utility on mobility is addressed through log sum parameters. The model confirms the effects of life-cycle events, parcel, socio-demographic, land use, transportation, neighbourhood and accessibility characteristics. The findings reveal that households relocating for the occurrence of life-cycle events are active in the housing market following the birth of a child, marriage and vehicle purchase. Relocation to live in a desirable neighbourhood is found to delay the move for the reason of living closer to activity points. Results also indicate that duration is likely to be shorter with the increase in expected utility from the following location. Regarding the location choice, preferences for dwellings closer to schools are evident. In the case of heterogeneity, it is observed that urban dwellers are more likely to prefer locations closer to the workplace with the addition of jobs in the household. In contrast, suburban dwellers are more likely to prefer residing far from the workplace. The developed joint model has been included in an integrated urban model, currently under development at the University of British Columbia.",Residential mobility,Residential location choice,Reasons for moving out,Competing hazard model,Latent segmentation-based logit model,LIFE-COURSE EVENTS,SET FORMATION,LOGIT MODEL,ACCESSIBILITY,NEIGHBORHOOD,INTENTION,WORK,MOVE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the project still at a very early stage, this paper presents its essential methodological outline, focusing on its elements of innovativeness. These reside in the revival and semantic renovation of Threshold Theory: based on the concept of threshold cost, this evaluation methodology allows the interpretation of a phenomenon's subsequent development stages as an irregular process, characterised by static and dynamic thresholds whose passing are associated with threshold cost, which must be spent due to endogenous or exogenous diseconomies. Moreover, the support of Multicriteria Analysis will allow for the determination of the correct weights and parameters to choose from.

This study pursues two objectives: firstly, to establish a market segmentation for shared ride services and secondly, to evaluate the environmental impact of ridesharing in different contexts. To mitigate potential biases linked to stated preference data, we analysed the navette service, utilized by a research institute in Europe, closely resembling future SAVs. The market segmentation relied on hierarchical cluster analysis using employee survey responses, while the environmental analysis was grounded in the 2019 navette service data. Our analysis revealed four unique employee clusters: Cluster 1, emphasizing active transportation and environmental awareness; Cluster 2, showing openness towards SAVs given reliable alternatives are available; Cluster 3, the largest segment, highlighting a demand for policy support and superior service quality; and Cluster 4, which places a premium on time, suggesting a potential need for strategies to make the service more efficient and, consequently, discourage private car use.

Housing conditions ensure their ability to participate in social life, especially when they suffer from mobility restrictions. Barrier-free access to the residence and to rooms within the residence is a key condition for their everyday mobility. As a result, this is what we define as minimal criteria for barrier-reduced residences. This article examines the extent to which people aged 65 and over (including people with mobility issues) live in barrier-reduced housing and what factors influence the chance of living in such residences. Data and methodCross-sectional data from the German Ageing Survey (DEAS) 2020/21 (persons aged 65 and over, n = 2,854) were used. The DEAS is a representative cross-sectional and longitudinal survey of the population aged 40 and over in Germany. In our analyses, we used logistic regression models to investigate the probability of living in a barrier-reduced residence. We defined housing as barrier-reduced when the apartment/house and the rooms inside it can be reached without steps or stairs. As explanatory variable, we considered mobility restrictions, defined as limited ability to climb a flight of stairs. In addition, the model includes other individual factors (age, gender, equivalized household income), regional factors (living in East vs. West Germany, in urban vs. rural region) and moving to the current residence after the age of 65. Results and discussionOf all individuals aged 65 or older, 19.3 percent live in a barrier-reduced residence. Also, of mobility-restricted elders, only 21.4 percent have such residences. The logistic regression results show that mobility restrictions are associated with a higher probability of living in a barrier-reduced residence. Compared to the lowest income group, older people in the highest income group are more likely to live in barrier-reduced housing. East Germans and people in urban areas are less likely to live in a barrier-reduced home. The likelihood of barrier-reduced living is higher among seniors who moved into their current residence after age 65. No significant differences were found for age groups and gender. The findings show that not enough seniors have barrier-reduced access to their homes and rooms, even if they suffer from mobility restrictions. Preventing functional restrictions must therefore also include improvements in the residential environment, especially in disadvantaged residential areas.",barrier-reduced housing,mobility restriction,aging in place,moving in old age,Germany,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the help of a primary survey of 293 workers in the Chennai Metropolitan Region between January and June 2018, augmented with in-depth interviews of 20 women on their commuting parameters and mobility constraints, we document gender disparity in the use of modes of transport with women relying more on public transport (among low skilled workers) and cab services (among high skilled workers) compared to men's higher use of personal modes of transport. The transport mode in turn, adversely influences the time, cost and/or convenience of commuting for women. The evidence suggests that the mode of transport is not being endogenously determined, but a constraint that appears to emerge due to gender norms surrounding access to transport resources. The home location also acts as a constraint for working married women if a cultural norm requires them to move into a spouse's home location post marriage.

However, with completed urban road networks and the mass of family cars, the question of how to incentivize people to prioritize public transport as a mode of travel has become an issue for city management and designers to consider. To improve the accessibility (the so-called last mile) of the public transport network, many cities have deployed mobility hubs to provide more choices for people to travel. In addition, research has shown that the convenience, comfort, and functional diversity of walking processes can help people to abandon driving in favor of walking or cycling.

This work aims to understand which characteristics of the urban environment could influence mobility-related air pollution, quantify the health impacts of exposure to traffic-derived PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations, and assess the potential health benefits expected from traffic interventions. The health benefits modeled are intended to provide a set of comparable data to support decision-makers and encourage informed decision-making to design healthier cities. Targeting a large geographical coverage, 12 European cities from 9 countries were comparatively assessed in terms of mean daily traffic volume/area, the number of public transport stops/area, and the percentage of green and outdoor leisure areas, among other urban indicators. This was implemented using an open-source data mining tool, which was seen as a useful engine to identify potential strategies to improve air quality. The comparison of urban indicators in the selected cities evidenced two trends: (a) cities with the most heterogeneous distribution of public transport stops, as an indicator of poor accessibility, are also those with the lowest proportion of km dedicated to cycleways and footways, highlighting the need in these cities for more sustainable mobility management; and (b) the percentage of green and outdoor leisure areas may influence the share of journeys by bicycle, pointing out that promoting the perception of green routes is relevant to enhance the potential of active transport modes. Socioeconomic factors can be key determinants of the urban indicators and would need further consideration. For the health impact assessment (HIA), two baseline scenarios were evaluated and compared. One is based on mean annual traffic contributions to PM2.5 concentrations in each target city (ranging between 1.9 and 13 mu g/m(3)), obtained from the literature, and the second is grounded on mean annual NO2 concentrations at all available traffic and urban background stations within each city (17.2-83.5 mu g/m(3)), obtained from the European Environment Agency database. The intervention scenarios modeled were designed based on traffic mitigation strategies in the literature, and set to ranges of 6-50% in traffic-derived PM2.5 concentrations and of 4-12.5% in NO2 concentrations.

The results indicate that districts with better access to high-capacity transport systems and job opportunities exhibit higher levels of resilience and lower vulnerability. However, the study also uncovers socio-spatial inequalities, with resilience values tending to be higher in coastal areas and central business districts, exacerbating disparities. Addressing urban inequalities and segregation requires not only improving travel times and transportation systems but also considering the economic impact on vulnerable populations and promoting decentralized employment opportunities.",Resilience,Vulnerability,Public transport,Spatial segregation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exploring the role of perceived social impacts in mode choice in five European countries,ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE,OCT 2022,6,"Shifting away from private vehicle use in urban areas is a necessary step in the decarbonisation of mobility. A thorough understanding of the determinants of travel mode choice is paramount for developing policies that can effectively nudge people to make this shift. This paper analyses mode choice in commuting and grocery shopping journeys considering attitudes towards mobility, socio-economic factors and journey characteristics. A multinomial logistic regression is performed on survey data from 5028 household in five European countries (Hungary, Italy, Poland, Norway and Spain) to describe the choice between private vehicle, public transport and active modes. Measures for perception of negative transport externalities (that is indirect negative impacts from road transport activity) and support for sustainable mobility transition policies are considered. Results show that commuters more sensitive to negative transport externalities prefer private vehicles to public transport or active travel. This suggests a paradox may exist with respect to the perception of these externalities. Other factors such as journey characteristics, policy intervention support and family size have also a strong influence on mode choice.",Mode choice,Travel behaviour,Attitudes,Commute,Conditional multinomial logit,TRAVEL BEHAVIOR,PROBLEM AWARENESS,PERSONAL NORM,TRANSPORT,ATTITUDES,TIME,AUTOMOBILE,JOURNEYS,MOBILITY,HABIT,,,,,,,,,,,

Since UAVs are prohibited over important places in Urban Air Mobility (UAM), such as government and airports, it is important to develop air-ground non-cooperative UAV surveillance for air security all day and night. In the paper, an all-time UAV detection algorithm based on visible images during the day and infrared images at night is proposed by our team. We construct a UAV dataset used in urban visible backgrounds (UAV-visible) and a UAV dataset used in urban infrared backgrounds (UAV-infrared). In the daytime, the visible images are less accurate for UAV detection in foggy environments; therefore, we incorporate a defogging algorithm with the detection network that can ensure the undistorted output of images for UAV detection based on the realization of defogging. At night, infrared images have the characteristics of a low-resolution, unclear object contour, and complex image background. We integrate the attention and the transformation of space feature maps into depth feature maps to detect small UAVs in images. The all-time detection algorithm is trained separately on these two datasets, which can achieve 96.3% and 94.7% mAP50 on the UAV-visible and UAV-infrared datasets and perform real-time object detection with an inference speed of 40.16 FPS and 28.57 FPS, respectively.",UAM,UAV detection,all time,defogging detection,object enhancement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Faced with this situation, new urban policies are attempting to control the interaction between urban planning and urban mobility and to redefine a new dimension of proximity, which reduces excessive use of energy-consuming and polluting modes of travel, namely vehicles. This orientation is embodied in the 15-minute city model, which focuses on pedestrian accessibility from one's home to nearby services and urban spaces. From this perspective, the paper proposes a GIS-based model to evaluate pedestrian accessibility to mosques. Using the open-source software QGIS, a total number of 30 mosques in the Agdal district in the city of Fez in Morocco were studied to investigate their pedestrian accessibility, by examining their spatial distribution and also their capacity to accommodate the worshippers of their catchment areas. Considering the land use and the population density of each mosque's catchment area, the results showed that even if a mosque can be spatially accessible by walking, it may not be able to comfortably satisfy the potential worshippers in its area of influence. Many people are then forced to travel long distances, sometimes by vehicles, to reach other mosques that can eventually accommodate them. The proposed method helps city planners better understand the urban configuration in terms of spatial and functional pedestrian accessibility, for more inclusive and equitable cities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on six-month ethnographic fieldwork in Xi'an, China, it shows that taxi drivers generally prefer taxis to e-hailing. Because the e-hailing algorithm treats each driver independently, drivers' spatio-temporal skills become marginalised and taxi drivers are no longer able to maintain a regular spatio-temporal arrangement that facilitates their community nodes as they do in taxi-driving. Their preference for taxis is a response to the potential threat to their community and social values imposed by algorithm-enabled mobilities. The paper emphasises how workers' response to algorithmic digital automation are centred around and operationalised by spatio-temporal mobility. It also shows that the impacts of new mobilities are distributed unevenly across groups with different socio-economic backgrounds and life experiences, in this case vis-a-vis the privatisation and urbanisation of Chinese society.",Taxis,e-hailing,mobility,community,social value,spatio-temporal skills,urban China,INFRASTRUCTURE,LABOR,POLITICS,PEOPLE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study explores the public perception and acceptance of a new concept: shared car services in multi-unit residential buildings, offering residents tailored solutions while retaining the convenience of private car ownership. The study provides insights about the motivations and barriers to adoption among urban dwellers in Israel, using the methodology of focus groups to collect data and the Product Service System approach for analysis. This concept remains unexplored in current literature. The findings from three focus groups comprising Israeli dwellers in multi-unit buildings in densely populated areas suggest that the acceptance and adoption of such services are influenced by the availability of on- and offstreet parking, cost of private car ownership, service quality, and trust among users and toward the service provider. To remove adoption barriers and promote low-carbon sustainable mobility, policy implications include increasing the cost of car ownership and parking fees while reducing parking availability. Implementing more restrictive parking policies should be coupled with policy incentives that widen the availability of shared vehicle services. The insights gained could inform the integration of shared vehicles in multi-unit buildings and promote the development of supportive regulatory frameworks. Additionally, the study investigates whether the adoption of shared electric vehicle services in residential buildings encourages the installation of rooftop photovoltaic technology.

However, research addressing the interplay between e-shopping and transport mode choice is scarce and mostly focused on urban areas. Against this background, the paper complements current literature by answering the following research question: Is e-shopping behaviour associated with walking to in-store retail instead of using a private car, and what are the differences between urban and rural environments? Germany serves as the spatial laboratory, with the data from the 2017 Mobilita t in Deutschland (MiD) survey providing comprehensive insights on mobility and its socio-economic elements. Three logistic regression models are carried out to explore the impact of e-shopping frequency on transport mode choice for three different spatial settings: large agglomerations ( >= 100,000 inhabitants), urban counties, and rural counties. The results show that people who buy online more frequently in urban and rural counties tend to reach in-store destinations by car instead of walking.

However, the visual and acoustic urban landscapes are intrinsically linked: the intricate interplay between what we see and hear shapes noise perception in the urban environment. To measure this complex and mixed effect, we conducted a mobility-based survey in Hong Kong with 800 participants, recording their noise exposure, noise perception and GPS trajectories. In addition, we acquired Google Street View images associated with each GPS trajectory point and extracted the urban visual environment from them. This study used a multisensory framework combined with XGBoost and Shapley additive interpretation (SHAP) models to construct an interpretable classification model for noise perception. Compared to relying solely on sound pressure levels, our model exhibited significant improvements in predicting noise perception, achieving a six-classification accuracy of approximately 0.75. Our findings revealed that the most influential factors affecting noise perception are the sound pressure levels and the proportion of buildings, plants, sky, and light intensity. Further, we discovered non-linear relationships between visual factors and noise perception: an excessive number of buildings exacerbated noise annoyance and stress levels and diminished objective noise perception at the same time. On the other hand, the presence of green plants mitigated the effect of noise on stress levels, but beyond a certain threshold, it led to worsened objective noise perception and noise annoyance instead. Our study provides insight into the objective and subjective perception of noise pressure, which contributes to advancing our understanding of complex and dynamic urban environments.",Noise perception,Audio-visual environment,Street view images,Multi-sensory approach,ROAD TRAFFIC NOISE,GREEN SPACE,SOUND,ANNOYANCE,LANDSCAPE,EXPOSURE,QUALITY,HEALTH,LEVEL,VIEWS,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, the likelihood of upward blue-collar mobility increases by up to 2.3 percentage points (pp.) when exposed to mineral activities, while the likelihood of downward blue-collar mobility decreases by around 4 pp. Likewise, the likelihood of upward white-collar mobility increases by up to 1.6 pp. when exposed to mining activities, while the likelihood of downward mobility decreases by up to 13.3 pp. These effects are more pronounced for individuals born after the discoveries and the start of production. Our results also reveal some heterogeneous effects based on factors such as the migration status, African regions, the size of mineral discoveries, gender, and the urban-rural divide.

A key component of these mobility systems is the charge conditioner, or neutralizer, which is used to place a stationary charge distribution on the aerosols prior to mobility analysis. Yet, there are natural air ions in the atmosphere which are constantly conditioning the charge state of atmospheric aerosols. In this study, we demonstrate that this natural charging process can be utilized by these spectrometers to measure size distributions of atmospheric aerosols without using a conventional neutralizer. This is achieved by measuring charged particles of both polarities, in contrast to only one polarity as conventionally done. The bipolar data is used to retrieve air ion properties from which the aerosol charge fractions are calculated. We deployed this new method in urban Beijing to measure atmospheric aerosols over a period of two years and verified that size distributions can be effectively measured using natural air ions. There is good agreement in aerosol size distributions when comparing this new method to a conventional spectrometer, and good agreement in total particle number concentrations measured by a condensation particle counter. Additionally, measuring charged particles of both polarities makes the uncertainties due to aerosol charging now traceable. We show that during two years of measurement in urban Beijing, the properties of ions produced by conventional neutralizers drifted due to the aging of ion sources, while the properties of natural atmospheric ions remained stable over time, despite occasional short-period fluctuations.

Additionally, pedestrian paths often lack connectivity with other transportation modes like public transit and bike-sharing systems, making it difficult for people to access these services, especially those with mobility impairments. Urbanization also leads to increased traffic and higher speeds on roads, posing greater risks for pedestrians. Poor-quality crosswalks, inadequate traffic-calming measures, and insufficient enforcement of traffic laws further compound these dangers.

By 2050, millions of Africans are likely to consider, or be pushed into, migration because of climate hazards contributing to agricultural disruption, water and food scarcity, desertification, flooding, drought, coastal erosion, and heat waves. However, the migration-climate nexus is complex, as is the question of whether migration can be considered a climate change adaptation strategy across both the rural and urban space. Combining data from household surveys, key informant interviews, and secondary sources related to regional disaster, demographic, resource, and economic trends between 1990 and 2020 from north central and central dryland Namibia, we investigate (i) human migration flows and the influence of climate hazards on these flows and (ii) the benefits and dis-benefits of migration in supporting climate change adaptation, from the perspective of migrants (personal factors and intervening obstacles), areas of origin, and areas of destination. Our analysis suggests an increase in climate-related push factors that could be driving rural out-migration from the north central region to peri-urban settlements in the central region of the country. While push factors play a role in rural-urban migration, there are also several pull factors (many of which have been long-term drivers of urban migration) such as perceived higher wages, diversity of livelihoods, water, health and energy provisioning, remittances, better education opportunities, and the exchange of non-marketed products. Migration to peri-urban settlements can reduce some risks (e.g. loss of crops and income due to climate extremes) but amplify others (e.g. heat stress and insecure land tenure). Adaptation at both ends of the rural-urban continuum is supported by deeply embedded linkages in a model of circular rural-urban-rural migration and interdependencies.

This paper adds new evidence regarding the significance of urban form, built environment characteristics and more in general city planning, as intermediary factors between public and private life connected to civic engagement and public space use. Based on surveys and geographic data from the Greater Metropolitan Area of San Jose ', in Costa Rica, the article investigates how the results of citizen participation change depending on whether residents are from a compact or dispersed study area, relating to urban rhythms and mobility metrics. Findings suggest that inhabitants of group A (lower-density neighborhoods) differ significantly from group B (compact-city areas) in four variables: means of mobility, commuting time, public space use, and civic activism, while having similar sociodemographic composition. Compared with residents of group A, group B report higher levels of use and knowledge of public spaces and civic participation. These two aspects constitute, the Urban Civic Participation Index, which, related to self-reported free time, forms what we define as Public Time. The main characteristics of the compact city (higher population and building density, high street connectivity, grid presence and proximity of services, mixed land use) were found to be positively related to the outcomes of accessibility to public space and community participation. In contrast, there are no significant differences in the availability of free time between the two groups. This study, along with others on the compact city, shows that there are other reasons to reduce daily commuting distances in cities and the need of urban time policies to redesign urban society's temporal dimension besides the known environmental impacts. It also raises the question of how low urban density affects people's time and disposition to participate in public life.",Public space,Urban sprawl,Compact city,Urban form,Civic engagement,BUILT ENVIRONMENT,NETWORKS,HOMES,CITY,FORM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work, different spatial arrangements and locations for evergreen, deciduous trees and palms at NW street canyon are tested using ENVI-met numerical simulation tool. It is aimed to maximize the cooling effect of tree shade on street facades and attain better pedestrian thermal comfort in peak summer times. This ultimately gives better guidance for urban planners and policymakers towards an improved planting design pattern. Comparing simulation results, it is concluded that evergreen trees located at the building edge can provide up to 6°C cooler walls and up to 3.8°C when placed at the building centre. Whilst other tree species have lower cooling effects. Also, these trees have a great role in attaining better thermal comfort levels for pedestrians at the street level.

It is significant to understand its vulnerability, i.e., the variation in capacity and demand when confronted with unexpected events, particularly operational disruptions. Although the network topology is generally fixed, the hourly-changing travel demand greatly impacts the actual vulnerability of a URT system. Unfortunately, few existing studies consider the combined influence of dynamic travel demand and network topology. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a network vulnerability assessment method with the joint consideration of static network topology and dynamic travel demand. This method includes a defined reasonable path, an accessibilitybased identification of station importance with time-varying passenger demand, and a new dynamic vulnerability delay index considering affected travel demand. An empirical analysis was carried out by taking the URT system of Beijing, China as an example, and the impact of the more realistic multiple consecutive station failures in a URT system is also examined. Results show that the distribution of high-importance stations indeed varies with the time of day, affected by both static topology and hourly-changing passenger flow. When the disturbance of operation delay occurs, the impact of high-importance stations on the network vulnerability changes nonlinearly with the increase of delayed travel demand. Some stations that serve as bridges and are visited by large passenger flows have the greatest impact on network vulnerability. Network performance degradation is obviously segmented and stratified in the case of interval continuous failure. The disruption between different lines is the main cause of network performance degradation, and some high-importance stations within the lines act as catalysts to accelerate the performance degradation. The proposed method not only offers a valuable reference for quantifying network vulnerability arising from fluctuations in passenger mobility but also introduces a novel vulnerability evaluation index to the URT system.",Resilience,Human mobility,Complex network,Dynamic demand,Unexpected event,NETWORK,RESILIENCE,ROBUSTNESS,SCALE,EFFICIENCY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are several issues to solve in order to implement successful UAM systems.

Regulation and definition of aerial networks, but also the characterization of ground facilities (vertiports) to allow passengers and freight to access the services are among the most relevant issues to be discussed. To identify UAM transportation networks, suitably connected with ground transportation services, digital twin models could be adopted to support the modelling and simulation of existing-and expected-scenarios with constantly updated data for identifying solutions addressing the design and management of transport systems. In this perspective, a digital twin model applied to an existing urban context-the city of Bologna, in northern Italy-is presented in combination with a novel air transport network that includes the third dimension. The 3D Urban Air Network tries to satisfy the principle of linking origin/destination points by ensuring safe aerial paths and suitable aerial vehicle separations.

In this context, this paper focuses on autonomous navigation during vertical approach and landing procedures and provides three main contributions. First, visual sensing requirements relevant to Urban Air Mobility scenarios are defined considering realistic landing trajectories, landing pad dimensions, and wind effects. Second, a multi-sensor-based navigation architecture based on an Extended Kalman Filter is presented which integrates visual estimates with inertial and GNSS measurements and includes different operating modes and ad hoc integrity checks. The presented processing pipeline is built to provide the required navigation performance in different conditions including day/night flight, atmospheric disturbances, low visibility, and can support the autonomous initialization of a missed approach procedure. Third, performance assessment of the proposed architecture is conducted within a highly realistic simulation environment which reproduces real world scenarios and includes variable weather and illumination conditions.

There are many factors that affect intercity population mobility, such as socioeconomic attributes, geographical distance, and industrial structure. The complexity of the coupling among these factors makes it difficult to simulate intercity population mobility. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named the quantum harmonic oscillator model for simulation of intercity population mobility (QHO-IPM). QHO-IPM describes the intercity population mobility as being affected by coupled driving factors that work as a multioscillator-coupled quantum harmonic oscillator system, which is further transformed by the oscillation process of an oscillator, namely, the breaking point of intercity population mobility. The intercity population mobility among seven cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and its surrounding region is taken as an example for verifying the QHO-IPM. The experimental results show that (1) compared with the reference methods (the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and long and short-term memory (LSTM) models), the QHO-IPM achieves better simulation performance regarding intercity population mobility in terms of both overall trend and mutation. (2) The simulation error in the QHO-IPM for different-level intercity population mobility is small and stable, which illustrates the weak sensitivity of the QHO-IPM to intercity population mobility under different structures.

In recent years, mobility digital twin that makes a virtual replication of human mobility and predicting or simulating the fine-grained movements of the subjects in a virtual space at a metropolitan scale in near real-time has shown its great potential in modern urban intelligent systems. However, few studies have provided practical solutions. The main difficulties are four-folds: 1) the daily variation of human mobility is hard to model and predict; 2) the transportation network enforces a complex constraints on human mobility; 3) generating a rational fine-grained human trajectory is challenging for existing machine learning models; and 4) making a fine-grained prediction incurs high computational costs, which is challenging for an online system. Bearing these difficulties in mind, in this paper we propose a two-stage human mobility predictor that stratifies the coarse and fine-grained level predictions. In the first stage, to encode the daily variation of human mobility at a metropolitan level, we automatically extract citywide mobility trends as crowd contexts and predict long-term and long-distance movements at a coarse level. In the second stage, the coarse predictions are resolved to a fine-grained level via a probabilistic trajectory retrieval method, which offloads most of the heavy computations to the offline phase.

The approach provides the speedacceleration profile of transport flow at high spatial and temporal resolution. The speed-acceleration profiles can be converted to vehicle-specific power (VSP), which can be used to estimate vehicle emissions. The underlying data used in the model is retrieved from a large telematics dataset, which was collected from GPS-connected vehicles during their journeys over the UK's West Midlands region road network for the years 2016 and 2018. Single journey telematics data were geospatially aggregated and then distributed over GeoST-segments. In total, approximately 354,000 GeoST-segments, covering over 17,700 km of roads over 35 timeslots are parameterized. GeoST mapping of the average vehicle speed (traffic flow), and VSP over different road types are analysed. The role of road slope upon VSP is estimated for every GeoST-segment through knowledge of the elevation of the start and end points of the segments. Previously, road slope and its effect upon VSP have been typically ignored in transport and urban planning studies. A series of case studies are presented that highlight the power of the new approach over differing spatial and temporal scales. For example, results show that the total vehicle fleet moved faster by an average of 3% in 2016 compared to 2018. The studied roads at weekends are shown to be less safe, compared to weekdays, because of lower adherence to speed limits. By including road slope in VSP calculations, the annually averaged VSP results differ by +12.6%, +14.3%, and + 12.7% for motorways, primary roads, and secondary roads, respectively, when compared to calculations that ignore road slope.",Telematics data,Road transport,Vehicle specific power,Urban mobility,DRIVING CYCLE,ROAD SAFETY,SPEED,CAR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study of 43 large European cities, we undertook a comparative analysis of travel greenery availability by using high-resolution spatial data and daily school trips as a marker of a daily travel need. By recognising walking accessibility as the most sustainable and equally available mode of transportation, we first estimated the proportion of the population residing within walking distance to upper secondary schools. Second, we associated the detailed school routes with monthly green cover data and compared the spatial variation in travel greenery availability between European cities, taking seasonal variation into account. Lastly, we analysed spatial inequalities of travel greenery availability within the study cities using the Gini index, the Kolm-Pollak equally-distributed equivalent (EDE) index and Moran's I.

Aided by the ever-increasing availability of geospatial and mobility data, machine learning models have enabled large-scale systems for simulating city-wide macro and micro mobility behaviors, urban planning, transportation management, and disaster relief optimization. However, while many fields have invested significant effort in solving the model transferability and generalization problem, the inability of machine learning-based human mobility models to generalize to new locations has come to be implicitly accepted in most geospatial research. In this vision paper, we focus on this geospatial generalization problem, its root causes, and how it is restricting the applications of otherwise-promising research. Most importantly, we argue for several data- and modeling-driven innovations which could help remedy this problem, spanning mega-scale simulations, large foundation models, and multi-task, transfer, and meta-learning. We also spotlight a handful of promising ideas which have recently emerged from the community.

This review explores the barriers affecting women's mobility, in the first- and last-mile stretches, in low- and middle-income countries and their consequences on accessibility, availability, affordability, and acceptability of public transport. This review includes 42 studies on mobility, accessibility, safety, travel patterns, and gendered transport, employing mixed, quantitative, and qualitative methods. The barriers observed in these studies are primarily related to 1) public transport, 2) non-motorized transport, 3) safety, 4) gendered norms, 5) urban form, and 6) policies. The most common concerns for women are the lack of adequate, reliable, inclusive, safe, and integrated public transport, poor pedestrian infrastructure, and unsafe environments. These, coupled with gendered norms, restrict mobility and access to essential services and opportunities for women, especially if traveling with children and luggage, as well as for older adults and persons with disabilities. This is one of the first reviews focusing on barriers affecting women's mobility. It advocates for more contextualized evidence-based studies on first- and last-mile connectivity from more geographic locations, integrated feeder and main transport lines, and operationalizing and monitoring policies and regulations.",Women's mobility,Mobility barriers,Public transport,Gendered norms,Women's safety,INTERMEDIATE PUBLIC TRANSPORT,GENDER,ACCESS,CITY,ACCESSIBILITY,RESIDENTS,CHOICE,MODES,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Concerns over social distancing and new health regulations reduced the number of trips to under 20% of its historical values during extended periods of time during the lockdowns.

These uncoordinated and diverse uses without data-driven management have led to increased safety and sustainability issues. This research intends to address the increasing curbside uses of PUDO activities due to MoD services and proposes a data-driven agent-based simulation approach to plan designated PUDO zones in limited public curbside spaces. A case study was conducted for five street blocks in urban cores of the City of Gainesville, Florida, United States, based on longitudinal parking transaction and violation records, place visitation data, and geospatial data of parking assets. The results show that temporary PUDO zones should be designated at all investigated blocks during peak hours even when the MoD market penetration rate is low (i.e., 10%), which helps mitigate the occurrences of competing use events, while permanent PUDO zones should be designated for the two busiest blocks when the MoD market penetration rates increase to 30% or 50%. Sensitivity analyses suggest that the designated PUDO zones can mitigate curbside stresses more effectively when regulating MoD users' PUDO dwell time (e.g., within one minute).

Separate treatment of the spatial distribution, flux, and distance of human movement increases the complexity and uncertainty of understanding geographic phenomena. Therefore, we propose a flow-based location measure, termed the mobility difference index (MDI), that fuses multidimensional movement characteristics to quantify temporal variations and spatial differences in human mobility. The method quantifies the differences in human mobility by calculating the minimum transformation cost between two sets of origin-destination flows based on optimal transport theory. Simulation experiments confirmed the advantage of the MDI in perceiving the multidimensional characteristics of human movement, particularly regarding spatial distribution. We examined mobile signaling and positioning data from Wuhan and found that the proposed MDI could effectively identify the spatial and temporal dependencies of variations in human mobility and heterogeneous effects of spatial semantics and distance on spatial differences in human mobility.",Population movement,temporal variation,spatial difference,quantitative method,SPACE,LAW,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exploring urban green spaces as cooling solutions for older adults in a warming city,URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING,AUG 2024,0,"As cities grapple with the escalating challenges of urban heat and its impacts on vulnerable populations, particularly older adults, green spaces are increasingly promoted as effective urban cooling solutions. However, despite the extensive literature on people's access to and preferences for urban green spaces, little is known about the perception and use of these spaces as nature-based climate shelters on hot days, especially by older adults. This study focuses on Barcelona, a Mediterranean city facing rising temperatures, to explore older adults' patterns of use and preferences for urban green spaces on hot days. The research aims to: 1) analyze heat coping behaviors, emphasizing visits to urban green spaces; 2) identify crucial characteristics of green spaces for older adults; and 3) assess variations in behaviors and preferences based on socio-demographic factors. The study leverages survey data from 291 older adult residents, combining face-to-face and online formats. Results indicate that 54 % of older adults use urban green spaces for cooling on hot days, with preferences for morning or evening visits. Factors influencing non-visitation include perceived lack of thermal comfort, noisiness or crowdedness, and proximity issues. Alternative heat coping strategies include staying at home, traveling to cooler areas outside the city, visiting blue spaces, or air-conditioned indoor facilities. Preferred green space characteristics include abundant shade, leafy vegetation, accessibility factors (e.g., walkability), urban furniture (e.g., benches), and water features. Socio-demographic differences reveal higher green space use among younger age groups and residents in certain districts. Mobility limitations and lower education levels influence preferences, with mobility-challenged individuals prioritizing accessibility aspects. Lower-educated respondents are more likely to report barriers to accessing green spaces. These findings highlight the need for tailored urban planning strategies, considering sociodemographic variations, to mitigate heat-related health risks for older adults. By prioritizing green space accessibility, enhancing its quality, promoting its cooling benefits, addressing cooling inequalities and integrating climate considerations in urban green planning, cities facing increasingly pressing heat challenges can create climate-resilient and inclusive green environments that prioritize the well-being of their aging populations.",Thermal comfort,Climate shelters,Climate change adaptation,Nature-based solutions,Urban Heat Island,Ecosystem services,Vulnerability,ECOSYSTEM SERVICES,THERMAL COMFORT,HEAT,MICROCLIMATE,PREFERENCES,HEALTH,HOT,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study explores its effect on Urban Green Space (UGS) perception in Buenos Aires City (CABA), Argentina. We provide a detailed overview of the distribution of UGS in CABA, along with socio-economic analysis and visitors' profile and perception before and during the restrictive measures adopted by the national authorities to contain the COVID-19 outbreak (July to December of 2020). We conducted a series of surveys based on open and closed questions. Before the pandemic, surveys were carried out in situ in eight parks of six districts, randomly chosen. During the confinement, online surveys were conducted. According to our results, the mean UGS density in CABA is 6.09 m(2) /person, but marked differences between districts exist, ranging from 0.02 m(2) /person to 17.68 m(2) /person. This uneven distribution causes differences in the quality of life of CABA inhabitants, perhaps more pronounced during reduced-mobility situations like COVID-19 confinement. Socio economic analysis were done linking multidimensional poverty, COVID-19 positive cases and urban mobility in CABA. Regarding UGS visitors, before the confinement, the majority of respondents were employees or students; during the confinement, employees and retirees predominated. When asked to choose important attributes to describe their perception about the UGS from a given list, respondents selected ""calm,"" ""green,"" and ""sounds of nature,"" without differences before and during the confinement. However, when asked about the UGS role, the main answer was ""a place to be with nature"" before the confinement and ""an important place in the city"" during it. Understanding how society perceives the UGS, especially during crises, is essential to rethink the urban landscape and prepare our cities, towards biophilic cities and for a more sustainable future.",Landscape,Perception,Urban green space,Biophilic cities,COVID-19,PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT,PREFERENCE,HEALTH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, data used to evaluate associations between walkability indicators and travel behavior is obtained via traditional methods of data collection, like questionnaires, that are costly and hard to scale in large urban environments. Moreover, the spatial resolution of most indicators may not be sufficient to support granular local public interventions. To face these issues, we propose a novel walkability indicator that provides a score of walkability for every one-meter street point, based on street conditions and accessibility to points of interest calculated with a Cumulative-Gaussian impedance function. Resorting to Linear and Geospatial Weighted Regressions, we evaluate the associations between walkability features and pedestrian flow data retrieved from mobile phone communication signals for a week in March 2022. The relationship between walkability features and pedestrian flow is stronger during workdays, in which accessibility to education, food amenities and government services are the most important predictors. On the weekend, the features with more explanatory power are accessibility to crosswalks and leisure amenities. Accessibility to public transport, side-walk width and slope seem to impact pedestrian decisions independently of the day type, although the impact is stronger on weekends.

We find cities use multiple discourses which refer to the socio-economic, cultural identity and the spatial dimensions of public art in cities.

In response, cities are introducing pedestrianisation, cycle lanes or tactical urban interventions aimed at repurposing streets for other road users. Framed as 'experiments', these reallocations of street space disrupt traditional transport planning procedures, often with promising results in promoting active travel. They are also associated with deep conflicts and criticism, especially by citizens defending the right to drive. Despite their ability to stop experiments, such conflicts have been little explored in the debates about experimentation and automobility. Similarly, street experiments have in most cases been uncritically embraced as a panacea for urban mobility problems, with little attention paid to experimentation as an expression of austerity urbanism. This paper aims to deepen our understanding of street experiments and their relationship to automobility by contextualising their conflictual unfolding as an expression of post-political planning in the age of austerity urbanism. Through a critical examination of the Torino Mobility Lab, a collaborative pedestrianisation experiment in Torino, we show how the governance-beyond-state setup of such projects masks a complex and contested coexistence of different meanings and processes for reimagining urban mobility and public space. We show how conflicts emerge embedded in the problematic and post-political governance of transport experiments. Nested within austerity urbanism, the experiment remains limited in its ability to create healthy spaces for participation. We conclude by highlighting the limitations and contradictions of attempts to overcome car dependency embedded in post-political frameworks and neoliberal-austerity planning practices.",austerity,pedestrianisation,post-political,street experiments,transport governance,TACTICAL URBANISM,SPACE,CITY,INFRASTRUCTURE,CONTROVERSIES,DYNAMICS,CITIES,POWER,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of the literature on this subject predominantly focuses on individual assessments of these systems, overlooking the comparative analysis necessary for a comprehensive understanding. This study aims to bridge this gap by conducting a spatiotemporal analysis of two different shared micromobility modes of transportation, docked bike-sharing systems and dockless e-scooter-sharing systems operating in the municipality of Lisbon. The analysis is further segmented into arrivals and departures on weekdays and weekends. Additionally, this study explores the impact of sociodemographic factors, the population's commuting modes, and points of interest (POIs) on the demand for both docked bike-sharing and dockless e-scooter-sharing. Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) models are employed to estimate the influence of these factors on system usage in different parishes in Lisbon. Comparative analysis reveals that the temporal distribution of trips is similar for both docked bike-sharing and dockless e-scooter-sharing systems on weekdays and weekends. However, differences in spatial distribution between the two systems were observed. The MGWR results indicate that the number of individuals commuting by bike in each parish has a positive effect on docked bike-sharing, while it exerts a negative influence on dockless e-scooter-sharing. Also, the number of commercial points of interest (POIs) for weekday arrivals positively affects the usage of both systems. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of shared micromobility patterns in urban environments and can aid cities in developing effective strategies that not only promote and increase the utilization of these shared micromobility systems but also contribute to sustainable urban mobility.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, nature experiences can also be perceived incidentally, if daily living activities like trips are encouraged towards green spaces. In a public participation GIS (PPGIS) survey of five local districts in Copenhagen, 517 respondents mapped 688 places along their walking or cycling shortcut trips through green spaces. This study investigated what types of green space provide opportunities for such shortcuts, what inci-dental nature experiences can be perceived there and the different responses of pedestrians and cyclists. This study also explored the relation between incidental nature experiences and green space characteristics in the form of tree cover density. Lastly, this study explored whether frequent short trips through green spaces relate to nature connectedness.

Pedestrians are found more prone to experience surprise, inspiration and emotion, while cyclists prefer shortcuts close to water, which they value highly. The study suggests that high tree cover density is key to delivering incidental nature experiences. Furthermore, the study shows that people who make frequent trips through green spaces have higher levels of nature connectedness, indicating that incidental nature experiences during shortcut trips trigger the reconnection of people and nature.

In congestion scenarios, congestion-related path flow (CPF) and congested path sub-flow (CPSF) are extended to track individuals' congestion exposure and explore the correlations between congestion and human mobility. To finely classify congestion-related travel demands, a Bayesian inference approach, incorporating destination and spatiotemporal heterogeneities, is developed to deduce trip purposes. The experiments conducted in Wuhan demonstrate the availability and importance of PF in spatiotemporal dynamics analysis of human mobility.

The dataset captures movement traces of a large number of international travelers who visited South Korea in 2018. By introducing two prediction models, one being Markov chain and the other with a recurrent neural network architecture, we assess how well travelers' movements can be predicted under different model settings, and examine how predictability relates to travelers' length of stay and activeness in travel patterns. Since travelers' destination choices are quite diverse in South Korea, this enables us to further investigate the geographic variation of the models' performance. Results show that the Markov chain model achieves an overall accuracy between 33.4% (@Acc1 metric) and 64.2% (@Acc5 metric), compared to 41.9% (@Acc1) and 67.7% (@Acc5) for the recurrent neural network model.

There is a notable geographic variation in the models' performance, meaning that travelers' movements are more predictable in some cities, but less in others. We believe this study represents a new effort in portraying the movement predictability of urban tourists and visitors.

In recent years, the lives of poor urban dwellers have undergone significant transformations which have been associated with shifts in patterns of daily food consumption from household-based towards primarily out-of-home. However, as of yet, little research has explored how changing everyday contexts of consumers' lives interrelate with their food vending-consumption practices. This study seeks to understand the interrelations between everyday urban lives and out-of-home food consumption practices among the urban poor in Ibadan, Nigeria. A situated social practice approach is employed to understand how everyday contexts shape practices of out-of-home food vending consumption. Multiple methods were employed, including GIS mapping of food vending outlets, quantitative consumer surveys, in-depth consumer interviews, and participant observation. The study provides an overview of food vending-consumption practices in terms of the socio-demographic situation of consumers and the embeddedness of food vending in the practice arrangements making up their daily lives. The findings reveal three key daily life practices that interlock with their ready-to-eat foods consumption practices: daily mobility practices, working arrangements, and domestic engagements These three categories of daily urban practices that have undergone rapid transformation in line with socio-economic change and urbanisation and emerged as particularly important in shaping out-of-home food consumption. The paper concludes by considering the importance of understanding the embeddedness of food vending practices in the daily lives of the urban poor for sustainable food systems transitions in the Global South.

In this study, using mobile phone data, we therefore examine daily spatial mobilities in Stockholm to understand how they changed during the pandemic from their pre-pandemic baseline given this background. The analysis demonstrates: that mobilities did indeed change but with some variations according to (a) the residential social composition of places and (b) their locations within the city; that the changes were long lasting; and that the average fall in spatial mobility across the whole was not caused by everybody moving less but instead by more people joining the group of those who stayed close to home. It showed, furthermore, that there were seasonal differences in spatial behaviour as well as those associated with major religious or national festivals. The analysis indicates the value of mobile phone data for spatially fine-grained mobility research but also shows its weaknesses, namely the lack of personal information on important covariates such as age, gender, and education.",COVID19,Urban form,Big data,Spatial mobility,Temporal analysis,DISTANCE-DECAY,PATTERNS,MODELS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, POI recommendation models based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been extensively studied and achieved, however, the effective incorporation of both spatial and temporal information into such GNN-based models remains challenging. Temporal information is extracted from users' trajectories, while spatial information is obtained from POIs. Extracting distinct fine-grained features unique to each piece of information is difficult since temporal information often includes spatial information, as users tend to visit nearby POIs. To address the challenge, we propose Mobility Graph Transformer (MobGT) that enables us to fully leverage graphs to capture both the spatial and temporal features in users' mobility patterns. MobGT combines individual spatial and temporal graph encoders to capture unique features and global user-location relations. Additionally, it incorporates a mobility encoder based on Graph Transformer to extract higher-order information between POIs. To address the long-tailed problem in spatial-temporal data, MobGT introduces a novel loss function, Tail Loss. Experimental results demonstrate that MobGT outperforms state-of-the-art models on various datasets and metrics, achieving 24% improvement on average.

Yet, the assumed social impact of FFPT has since been under-researched. Based on qualitative research with 22 transport-dependent users, including two semi-structured interviews and a seven-day travel diary, this study examines the daily experiences, mobility constraints, and travel practices of care mobilities, i.e., journeys made to care for others or a household. Findings indicate that the absence of fares, although a relative variable in modal choice, allows carers expanded activity spaces, independence from car ownership, and easier coordination of care tasks. I propose to frame accessibility as a relational process emerging from passengers' encounters and the practices adopted to navigate shared spaces. With this, I argue that understanding public transport use and experiences at a micro-level offers an intersectional and justice lens to commuter-oriented transport and neoliberal urban planning policies.",Care mobilities,fare-free public transport,fare policies,gendered mobilities,mobility constraints,TIME-GEOGRAPHY,GENDER,PATTERNS,EQUITY,IMPACT,INCOME,CITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the traditional urban and suburban communities experience the least risk of Covid-19, minority communities are severely impacted in the initial and outbreak stages, and remote suburban communities are primarily affected in the outbreak and recovery stages. The regression further reveals the role of urban form in the pandemic. High-density urban land use is the main density factor contributing to the disease's spread. In the initial stage, mobility factors such as street connectivity and walkability contribute to the local spread, while land use mixture is the catalyst in the outbreak stage. A comprehensive compact development might offset these negative effects on local public health, and its contribution to local resilience in the recovery stage is also confirmed. Thus, compact development is still valuable for building urban resilience, and proper planning and policies can offset the potential adverse effects of pandemics.",Covid-19,community,compact development,urban form,BUILT ENVIRONMENT,HEALTH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, accurate detection and localization of seismic sources at the urban scale with conventional seismic sensing networks is unavailable due to the prohibitive costs of ultra-dense seismic arrays required for imaging high-frequency anthropogenic seismic sources. Here, we leverage existing fiber-optic networks as a distributed acoustic sensing system to accurately locate urban seismic sources and estimate how their intensity varies with time. By repurposing a 50-kilometer telecommunication fiber into an ultra-dense seismic array with 50,000 channels, we generate high-resolution spatiotemporal maps of seismic source power (SSP) across San Jose, California. Our approach overcomes the proximity limitations of urban seismic sensing, enabling accurate localization of remote seismic sources generated by urban activities. Examples of detected activities are vehicle movements and operations at construction sites and schools. We also show strong correlations between SSP values and noise level measurements, as well as various persistent urban features, including point of interest density, land use patterns, and demographics.

The Beijing government implemented large-scale policy interventions to achieve structural industrial changes in order to stop the downward spiral of poverty and segregation in ""urban villages."" Beijing has accelerated the redevelopment of urban villages and helped tens of thousands of low-wage migrant workers in garment villages move to surrounding secondary cities or small towns in Hebei Province with better opportunities. However, low-wage migrant workers did not respond linearly to the intervention. This study analyzes the reasons underlying the response of low-wage migrant workers to these policy interventions. First, the antipoverty policy is a geographic exercise, moving low-end industries from a global center to peripheral locations. This study considers why this mobility strategy for improving opportunity has become the arena for opportunistic behavior and conceptualizes the logic of opportunism and the self-worth of low-wage migrant workers in a metropolitan area. Second, the Beijing government is attempting to disperse the low-end informal industries into formal industrial bases in Hebei. Dispersal campaigns inevitably involve circuitous mobility and the outcome of dispersal is inherently unstable. One of the crucial questions in dispersal strategies is scale. Would an upscaled Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) City Region or a downscaled ""neighborhood effect"" better implement the antipoverty strategy? This dispersal strategy can break up the concentration of migrants, but their perceived opportunities remain in Beijing. One of the obstacles to the full implementation of the dispersal strategy is grassroots opposition. This study uses a three-year survey conducted prior to the COVID-19 lockdown to analyze how displaced migrant workers perceive these opportunities in their processual and networked decision-making. Garment villages are important ""anchor places"" where migrants can mobilize their social capital and facilitate upward mobility outside a dominant institution in Beijing.

Households predominantly purchased food from open-air markets and vendors, and only a subset of households bought food from supermarkets. Variations in urban population size, area, and connectivity across the 18 cities presented a clustering of four city types that shape household food access and purchasing patterns at food retail locations. Despite a growing narrative that supermarkets and western diets will dominate SSA's urban food systems, our findings suggest that low- to middle-income households will continue to purchase food at open-air markets in SSA's secondary cities in the coming years. Attention to these urban household purchasing patterns can inform urban planning and governance priorities to ensure that SSA's food systems can meet urban food security needs.",Food systems,Food security,Urbanization,Urban planning,Secondary cities,Africa,URBAN AGRICULTURE,SECURITY,SUPERMARKETS,ECONOMY,TRANSFORMATIONS,URBANIZATION,GOVERNANCE,MOBILITY,POVERTY,QUALITY,,,,,,,,,,

Amid such challenging circumstances, there has been a growing attention placed on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11.7, which has brought opportunities for urgent action. In this paper, we applied the Gini coefficient to our analysis of unequal access to urban greenspaces across all urban planning areas in six special municipalities in Taiwan. Moreover, we also conducted comparative analyses between the Gini coefficient and other socio-economic factors. The results show that approximately 63.98% of the urban planning area suffers from unequal access to greenspaces. In addition, urban greenspace provision and household income show significant positive correlations with the Gini coefficient, which reflects Taiwan's environmental injustice. Furthermore, these findings can help city planners and decision-makers evaluate levels of equality in each urban planning area and decide which priority areas should be improved.

We ask: what are the drivers behind these innovations in these regions? What are the potential barriers? And what implications for policy or sustainability transitions emerge? Based on a review of the academic literature, we argue that these innovations are particularly important at providing low-carbon transitions for the transport sector, even though low-carbon development is an important topic that is under-researched in many developing economies. We begin by introducing these three innovations and justifying our four case studies. We base the research design on an interdisciplinary critical and umbrella literature review. We then discuss the results of our review, which is organized as a dualism of positive drivers and negative barriers, before discussing how to better harness innovation for low-carbon mobility in an African context.

An evaluation method is required for this purpose to decide which parts of a transit network should be upgraded first.

The basic hypothesis is that OllivierRicci curvature indicates the theoretical attractiveness of the fastest path between any two nodes, thereby capturing the internal structure of the transit network. Meanwhile, travel demand and behavior can be approximated by urban mobility big data. By comparing the theoretical attractiveness and the flow volume between a path between two stations, the traits of lines with mismatched supply and demand are identified, and macro strategies are suggested.

Previous studies establish a connection to the importance of greening to mitigate the surface urban heat island (SUHI) and evaluate the effectiveness of these measures on urban climate. In this study, land surface temperature (LST), a remote sensing (RS) parameter, recorded by Landsat satellites (5, 7, and 8) was used to evaluate the effect of SUHI in Vitoria-Gasteiz between 1985-2021. The aim was to evaluate whether the urban greening actions influenced the local thermal conditions and, consequently, helped minimize the SUHI. Thirty sampling locations were identified, corresponding to different local climate zones (LCZ), at which LST data were extracted. A total of 218 images were processed and separated into summer and winter. Four of the 30 locations had, since 2003, on-site meteorological stations with regular air temperature (Tair) measurements which were used to validate the LST data. The results showed that Spearman's correlation between Tair and LST was higher than 0.88 in all locations. An amount of 21 points maintained the same LCZ classification throughout the analysed period and nine underwent a LCZ transformation. The highest average temperature was identified in the city centre (urbanized area), and the lowest average was in a forest on the outskirts of the city. SUHI was more intense during the summer. A significant increase in SUHI intensity was identified in areas transformed from natural to urban LCZs.

However, traditional studies have failed to capture fully a high-frequency understanding of how urban vibrancy is linked to urban features, how this might differ for different genders, and how this might affect segregation in cities. Our results show that (1) there are differences between males and females in terms of urban vibrancy, (2) the differences relate to 'Points of Interest' as well as transportation networks, and (3) there are both positive and negative 'spatial spillovers' existing across each city.

This study takes a critical look at the city definition in China and summarizes two critical challenges that emerge when prefecture-level cities are adopted as city-equivalent statistical units.

The second challenge is that, because prefecture-level cities cannot represent the real functional areas that are based on a daily labor-shed concept, the estimation of inter-city mobility could be largely erroneous by conflating the real inter-city travel with the de facto intra-metropolitan travel such as daily commuting. While the first challenge has long been addressed by scholars and eventually by the national government of China in 2008, the second challenge remains to be solved. These two challenges demand rigorous attempts to delineate cities in China considering integrated economic and social units. This study sheds light on how delineation of administrative boundaries affects our understanding of city hierarchy and spatial interactions. Its implications are not limited to China but applicable to other countries and regions.",City definition,prefecture-level city,inter-city mobility,functional area,urban China,BIG DATA,POLICY IMPLICATIONS,URBAN EXPANSION,CITIES,GUANGZHOU,DYNAMICS,MOBILITY,SYSTEM,MODES,WUHAN,,,,,,,,,,,

The extension and quality of such infrastructure is investigated in two neighborhoods that are different both in territorial and social terms (Bangu and Copacabana). The results show a concentration of cycling infrastructure of greater extension and quality in Rio de Janeiro’s highest-income neighborhoods (Copacabana) and of lesser extension and quality in the periphery (Bangu), and the difference in existence, extension, and quality of Rio de Janeiro’s cycling infrastructures is related to greater or lesser citizenship.",cycling infrastructure,cycle path,urban mobility,Rio de Janeiro,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although deep learning based models have shown promising results over the past decade, their reliance on extensive private mobility data for training and their inability to perform zero-shot predictions, have hindered further advancements. Recently, attempts have been made to apply large language models (LLMs) to mobility prediction task. However, their performance has been constrained by the absence of a systematic design of workflow. They directly generate the final output using LLMs, which limits the potential of LLMs to uncover complex mobility patterns and underestimates their extensive reserve of global geospatial knowledge. In this paper, we introduce AgentMove, a systematic agentic prediction framework to achieve generalized mobility prediction for any cities worldwide. In AgentMove, we first decompose the mobility prediction task into three sub-tasks and then design corresponding modules to complete these subtasks, including spatial-temporal memory for individual mobility pattern mining, world knowledge generator for modeling the effects of urban structure and collective knowledge extractor for capturing the shared patterns among population. Finally, we combine the results of three modules and conduct a reasoning step to generate the final predictions. Extensive experiments on mobility data from two sources in 12 cities demonstrate that AgentMove outperforms the best baseline more than 8% in various metrics and it shows robust predictions with various LLMs as base and also less geographical bias across cities.

These violent measures are often differentially experienced with 'street vending mothers', the elderly and those with disabilities bearing the brunt of Harare's authoritarian spatial governance. Alternatively, the city has also experimented with what we call governing through 'spatial containment', aimed at 'taming' street traders and transforming them into formalized entities. We demonstrate that despite its noble intentions, such a policy approach has unintended outcomes for street traders since it undermines the organic attributes of their trade: operational flexibility, spatial mobility and proximity to customers.

The validation of the UML method showed that it achieved a coefficient of determination of 0.836 when estimating OD flows using boarding-alighting data. Upon the successful validation, the proposed methodology was implemented to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on the mobility of the New York City subway system. The implementation results indicate that (1) the rise in the number of weekly new COVID-19 cases intensified the impact on the public transport mobility, but not as strongly as public health interventions; and (2) the inflows to and outflows from the center of the city were more sensitive to the impact of COVID-19.",COVID-19,Urban mobility,Origin-destination flow estimation,Unsupervised machine learning,TRAFFIC COUNTS,TRIP MATRICES,PREDICTION,MODEL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In urban Africa this challenge is compounded by the fragmented material condition of cities. As a result, a growing number of tech companies have been compelled by the possibility of creating digital platforms that address the unique logistical configurations of African cities, often enrolling informal systems such as motorcycle taxis to address spatial and economic fragmentation. Through the perspective of three Nairobi-based startups that incorporate motorcycle taxis into their last-mile platforms, this article illustrates how processes of 'algorithmic suturing' knit together the loose ends of splintered urban networks thanks to platform business models that visualize the last mile as a site of optimization. In parallel with common understandings of suturing within African infrastructure debates which foreground makeshift practices of the urban poor, this article argues that algorithmic suturing is a speculative endeavour through which urban fractures are made legible as sites of value.

This is because the use of digital twins in the operation and control of UAM vehicles is essential for the UAM operational digital twin infrastructure (UAM-ODT). There are several issues that need to be addressed in this process: (i) the lack of digital twin engines for the digitalization (twinization) of the dynamics and control of UAM vehicles at the core of UAM-ODT systems; (ii) the lack of back-end system engineering in the development of UAM vehicle DTs; and (iii) the lack of fault-tolerant mechanisms for the DT cloud back-end system to run uninterrupted operations 24/7. On the other hand, software aging and rejuvenation are becoming increasingly important in a variety of computing scenarios as the demand for reliable and available services increases. With the increasing use of containerized systems, there is also a need for an orchestrator to support easy management and reduce operational costs. In this paper, an operational digital twin (ODT) of a typical urban air mobility (UAM) infrastructure is developed on a private cloud system based on Kubernetes using a proposed cloud-in-the-loop simulation approach. To ensure the ODT can provide uninterrupted operational control and services in UAM around the clock, we propose a methodology for investigating software aging in Kubernetes-based containerized clouds. We evaluate the behavior of Kubernetes software using the Nginx and K3S tools while they manage pods in an accelerated lifetime experiment. We continuously execute operations for creating and terminating pods, allowing us to observe the utilization of computing resources (e.g., CPU, memory, and I/O), the performance of the Nginx and K3S environments, and the response time of an application hosted in those environments. In some conditions and for specific metrics, such as virtual memory usage, we observed the effects of software aging, including a memory leak that is not fully cleared when the cluster is stopped. These issues could lead to system performance degradation and eventually compromise the reliability and availability of the system when it crashes due to memory space exhaustion or full utilization of swap space on the hard disk. This study helps with the deployment and maintenance of virtualized environments from the standpoint of system dependability in digital twin computing infrastructures where a large number of services are running under strict continuity requirements.",operational digital twin,urban air mobility,cloud-in-the-loop simulation,software aging,software rejuvenation,Kubernetes,Nginx,K3S,VIRTUALIZATION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparison with the existing uncertainty modelling methods is conducted using the real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate the presented BiLSTM assisted framework's robust outperformance in achieving more adaptive and accurate movement uncertainty prediction, as measured by multiple metrics.

Factors driving spatial correlations were explored using QAP regression. Additionally, spatial heterogeneity of economic resilience was analysed, and GeoDetector was employed to determine the impacts of various factors and their interactions. The economic resilience of 26 cities within the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration was calculated. The spatially correlated network exhibits lower density and efficiency. Some cities play central, bridging, and connected roles, while others have limited connectivity, linked to factors like population mobility, spatial adjacency, economic development difference, and knowledge network. During regional integration strategy promotion, significant global spatial autocorrelation is observed, and local spatial autocorrelation reveals heterogeneity in economic resilience.

Urban planners and designers must develop urban forms that address these chal-lenges. With the integration of new communication and information technologies (Smartphone, GIS, Drones, IoT, Sensors, etc.), urban activities have generated large volumes of urban data. The rapid growth in terms of collection and big data storage capacities combined with the ever-increasing computational power of modern machines have made possible their efficient treatment using machine (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. The emergence of such groundbreaking methods has in turn helped to address the challenges of modern-day cities in several domains (health, security, mobility, etc). ML algorithms have been proposed to model the urban form's indicators for intelligent urban planning decision making. They have been proven to perform better than the traditional methods. However, the potential of ML has not yet been fully explored in research for urban planning decision support.

An accurate and updated delineation of the UFZs is crucial for assessing the functional integration between cities within a mega-city region. Mobility data provides a chance to depict the UFZs from actual human activities at a finer spatial scale. Existing studies mostly adopted network-based approaches relying on the topological relationship but ignoring spatial factors, causing the lack of sensitivity in detecting the cross-cities integration of the functional region. This research proposed a novel regionalisation algorithm that redraws non-overlap boundaries of urban functional zones based on the commuting origin-destination matrix, representing the spatial interactions within cities and cross-cities. In particular, functional zones are drawn by searching for the best partition with the best goodness of fitting in the hierarchical spatial interaction model.

By adopting two different settings, this model evaluated the current status and predict the future trend of urban integration respectively. The results show the current boundary of UFZs in the SDH area almost coincides with administrative boundaries.

Covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM) was used with a sample from the US and China. The results confirm that attitudes, perfor-mance expectancy, and social influence reinforce the intention to use UAAVs, while anxiety reduces it. The UAAV acceptance model is very similar between the Chinese and US populations. The only difference between the two samples is that social influence has a positive and significant effect on intention to use among US people. At the same time, this variable is not essential in the Chinese sample.",Covariance-based structural equation modeling,Human values,Intention to use,Pro-environmental behavior,Urban air autonomous vehicles,INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY,ACCEPTANCE,ADOPTION,DESIGN,USAGE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Urban environments combine natural elements like topography and waterways, with various intensities of urban development. These combinations shape the spatial environment of cities and influence the diversity and persistence of urban wildlife. Insectivorous bats occur in urban areas, with urban tolerant species correlated with greater mobility and flexible roosting strategies, such as trawling bats. To understand how trawling bats use urban space, we studied patterns of land use selection in an urban population of a trawling bat, the large-footed myotis (Myotis macropus) in a subtropical city. We quantified fine-scale space use using radio telemetry over two seasons using land use categories applied in urban planning and design. Bats used urban land use types in a non-random manner, displaying a preference for green and blue space associated with the recreation land use type at both the landscape and home range scale. Tracked bats used waterways and riparian areas, as well as parkland, sportsgrounds and other green space adjacent to waterways. Trawling bats are dependent on riparian habitats, and these complex habitats are particularly vulnerable to changes to the availability of water resources associated with climate change. Maintaining spatial heterogeneity in urban planning and design by retaining and providing green space along, and adjacent to waterways, will provide a landscape mosaic for urban trawling bats to persist, facilitating climate change resilience in a specialist urban species.",Trawling bat,Urban ecology,Green space,Urban planning,MYOTIS-ADVERSUS CHIROPTERA,FORAGING BEHAVIOR,DAUBENTONS BAT,HOME-RANGE,INSECTIVOROUS BATS,HABITAT SELECTION,BIODIVERSITY,PATTERNS,VESPERTILIONIDAE,URBANIZATION,,,,,,,,,,,,

To support this emerging aviation application, concepts for UAS/UAM traffic management (UTM) systems have been explored. Accurately characterizing and predicting the microscale weather conditions, winds in particular, will be critical to safe and efficient operations of the small UASs/UAM aircrafts within the UTM. This study implements a reduced order data assimilation approach to reduce discrepancies between the predicted urban wind speed with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) model with real-world, limited and sparse observations. The developed data assimilation system is UrbanDA. These observations are simulated using a large eddy simulation (LES). The data assimilation approach is based on the time-independent variational framework and uses space reduction to reduce the memory cost of the process. This approach leads to error reduction throughout the simulated domain and the reconstructed field is different than the initial guess by ingesting wind speeds at sensor locations and hence taking into account flow unsteadiness in a time when only the mean flow quantities are resolved. Different locations where wind sensors can be installed are discussed in terms of their impact on the resulting wind field. It is shown that near-wall locations, near turbulence generation areas with high wind speeds have the highest impact. Approximating the model error with its principal mode provides a better agreement with the truth and the hazardous areas for UAS navigation increases by more than 10% as wind hazards resulting from buildings wakes are better simulated through this process.

Restoring and developing green and blue infrastructures using nature-based solutions is vital to improving urban biodiversity and urban ecosystems. Healthy urban ecosystems have a high capacity to supply regulating (e.g., air, noise, climate and water regulation), provisioning (e.g., food, medicinal plants, biomass) and cultural (e.g., recreation, landscape aesthetics, social cohesion) ES. This multifunctionality can provide diverse environmental, social and economic benefits to urban residents, hence contributing to the sustainability of urban areas. However, urban green and blue areas are also associated with ecosystem disservices (e.g., plant allergies or poisoning, emission of biogenic volatile organic compounds, unpleasant smells), tradeoffs (e.g., increased water consumption, wildfire risk, associated management costs) and implementation barriers (e.g., political motivation, lack of knowledge, time and workload).

The rapid development of UAM has brought innovation and dynamism to many industries, especially in the field of logistics. Various types of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for use in transport logistics are being designed and produced. UAV logistics refers to the use of UAVs, usually carrying goods and parcels, to achieve route planning, identify risk perception, facilitate parcel delivery, and carry out other functions. This research provides a method for assessing the operational capacity of a UAV logistics route network. The concept of ""logistics UAV route network operation capacity"" is defined, and a bi-objective optimization model for assessing the route network's operating capacity is developed. The first objective is to maximize the number of UAV logistics delivery plans that can be executed in a fixed operation time. The second objective is to minimize the total operational impedance value in a fixed operation time. To solve the bi-objective optimization model, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is utilized. A UAV logistics route network with 62 nodes is developed to assess the rationale and validity of the proposed concept. The experiments show that with an increase in operation time, the route network's optimal operational capacity gradually increases, the convergence speed of the algorithm slows down, and the optimization magnitude gradually reduces. Two key parameters-operational safety interval and flight speed-are further analyzed in the experiments. According to the experiments, as the safety interval increases, the route network's average operational capacity steadily diminishes, as does its sensitivity to the safety interval. The average operational capacity steadily rose with the rise in flight speed, especially when the UAV logistics flight speed was between 10 m/s and 10.5 m/s. In that range, the operational capacity of the route network was substantially impacted by the flight speed.",air traffic management,airspace management,capacity assessment,urban air mobility,UAV logistics,AIRSPACE CAPACITY,DELIVERY,DRONE,MODEL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While pioneering studies have attempted to leverage multi-modal data for socioeconomic prediction, jointly exploring their underlying semantics remains a significant challenge. To address the gap, this paper introduces a Multi-Semantic Contrastive Learning (MuseCL) framework for fine-grained urban region profiling and socioeconomic prediction. Within this framework, we initiate the process by constructing contrastive sample pairs for street view and remote sensing images, capitalizing on the similarities in human mobility and Point of Interest (POI) distribution to derive semantic features from the visual modality.

To merge the acquired visual and textual features, we devise an innovative cross-modality-based attentional fusion module, which leverages a contrastive mechanism for integration.

Patterns of shock mobility and immobility are not new categories of movement, but rather are significant alterations to the timing, duration, intensity, and relations among existing movements. Many of these alterations have been induced by governments' reactions to the pandemic in both migrant-sending and receiving contexts, which can be especially consequential for migrants in and from the Global South. Our interventions explore these processes by highlighting experiences of Afghans and Kurds along Iran's borders, Western Africans in Europe, Filipino workers, irregular Bangladeshis in Qatar, Central Americans travelling northwards via Mexico, and rural-urban migrants in India.

The potential for sustainable densification is assessed through a spatial multi-criteria analysis performed at the census tract level considering 13 variables related to five living environment dimensions: socioeconomic profile, urban morphology, mixed-land use, urban green areas, and transportation and mobility. A municipality within the Emilia-Romagna region, Carpi, is selected as a case study to experiment with and validate the methodology.

Cross-border practices contribute to (re)produce functional border regions between different countries. The current amount of information on the geographies of cross-border mobilities of people, the creation of functional cross-border regions and how these regions change over time is inadequate. As transnational phenomena are fragile to global disruptions and prone to 'rebordering' in times of emergency, we lack knowledge of how the COVID-19 crisis affected border practices and functioning regions. We consider mobility to be a tool for understanding society and used big data to examine cross-border mobilities between the five Nordic countries: when and where borders were crossed, how mobilities captured functional border regions, and evaluated the influence of COVID-19 on mobilities and functional border regions from a spatio-temporal perspective. The feasibility of the proposed methodology for monitoring cross-border mobilities and border regions to improve planning and development of border regions and decision-making in future crises is discussed. We studied a 4-year Twitter dataset, including the first year of the pandemic until February 2021. We found that overall cross-border mobility decreased by 68% due to the pandemic, yet with geographical and temporal variations. We showed how the influence of the pandemic on the spatial extent of functional border regions varies for a range of reasons for cross-border mobility.

Conventional approaches tend to estimate segregation based on residential patterns. However, the residential dimension does not fully comprise individuals' interactions with their environment and, consequently, can misrepresent individuals' lived experiences. To address this gap, we analyse how segregation extends to other dimensions of the urban life. We accomplish this by using the Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE) to measure socioeconomic segregation at amenities and on public transit lines. Moreover, we consider the pivotal role that transport plays in democratising access to opportunities. Using transport networks, amenity visitations, and census data, we leverage agent-based models to approximate socioeconomic composition at amenities and on transit lines. Consequently, we can estimate socioeconomic segregation within the United States, for various aspects of urban life. We find that neighbourhoods that are segregated in the residential domain tend to exhibit similar levels of segregation in amenity visitation patterns and transit usage, albeit to a lesser extent. Moreover, we discover that low-income neighbourhoods experience a greater decrease from residential to amenity segregation, than their high-income segregated counterparts, highlighting how mobility can be used as a tool for overcoming residential inequalities, given the proper infrastructure. We identify inequalities embedded into transit service, which impose constraints on residents from segregated areas, limiting the neighbourhoods that they can access within an hour to areas that are similarly disadvantaged. By exploring socioeconomic segregation from a transit perspective, we underscore the importance of conceptualising experiential segregation, while also highlighting how transport systems can contribute to a cycle of disadvantage.",Transportation networks,socioeconomic segregation,urban analytics,ACCESSIBILITY,INEQUALITY,COVID-19,POVERTY,ACCESS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Existing methods mainly rely on surveys to obtain the coverage radii by fitting the first-mile distance distribution of metro passengers, which is costly and time-consuming to capture the spatiotemporal heterogeneity at the urban scale. Daily generated multi-source mobility data offers the possibility of a broad and low-cost assessment. This study proposes a framework to assess the coverage radius of metro stations using metro smart card data and Baidu population heatmap data. First, we build a nested logit model to model travelers' mode choice and station selection behaviors, considering both the competitiveness of the metro over other modes and travelers' sensitivity to first-mile distance. We then establish the relationship between choice probability and metro station inflows, calibrating the parameters through a genetic algorithm-based bi-objective optimization. Finally, we propose a novel metro station coverage assessment method using a distance-decay function that describes the cumulative mode choice proportions. An empirical analysis is conducted using Hangzhou, a sizeable monocentric city in China. The results reveal significant tidal patterns in travel behavior parameters. During the morning peak, suburban travelers rely more on the metro, whereas evening peak reliance is more pronounced among urban center travelers. This aligns with Hangzhou's commuting patterns. Moreover, significant differences occur in attraction patterns between downtown and suburban stations. Suburban metro stations exhibit larger coverage radii due to the lack of convenient alternative transport modes, a result that existing methods fail to capture. This evaluation framework can be extended to other cities, offering valuable insights for enhancing metro services.",Metro station coverage,First-mile distance distribution,Urban scale assessment,Spatial heterogeneity,Big data,TRANSIT,ACCESSIBILITY,MODE,TRANSPORT,DISTANCE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The gastronomy business is one of the most decentralized and location-based consumer business in urban, which is highly related to the economic attributes of cities. However, there are few studies on quantitative analysis of urban economic resilience through the opening and closing of restaurants. Understanding and planning for the aftermath of the COVID-19 may not only minimize detrimental effects but also provide insights into the economic recovery policies. This study analyzes the phenomenon of restaurant failures after the pandemic in Shenzhen, China via percolation in multilayer complex networks. We identify the closed restaurants through data mining, and construct the human mobility network through mobile phone location data, aggregating origin and destination points into grids. We then embedded the restaurants' Points of Interest (POIs) into the grids, creating an additional restaurant network layer. By considering spatial interactions between restaurants, we constructed a geographical proximity network for restaurants in each grid. Finally, Using these multilayered nested networks, we analyzed the pandemic's impact and the occurrence of critical phenomena related to restaurant closures under lockdown policies through percolation in multilayer complex networks. As a result, this study found that the severity of the pandemic significantly increased the probability of restaurant failures, with cascade and critical phenomena. However, implementing precise lockdown measures can effectively lower the probability of restaurant closures. These results highlight the effectiveness of accurate lockdown policies in striking a balance between epidemic prevention and economic development, contingent upon the correct identification of high-risk areas. This finding suggests that policy makers and public health departments need to balance policy effectiveness with interventions in economic activities in order to increase the resilience of urban economies during the pandemic.",Urban economic resilience,Percolation,COVID-19,Spatio-temporal analysis,Multilayer networks,human mobility,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pandemic-induced economic downturn and mobility restrictions have left more territories severely exposed to the adverse risk of food desertification. A food desert is a territory where people are food-insecure because of job/income loss or through the absence of food retail facilities. During lockdown, many non-essential firms were forced to close. This meant that many workers, especially those in more precarious positions, lost their jobs, while entrepreneurs had consistent financial shortcomings. Local population mobility was restricted to the municipality of residence, with reduced access to grocery stores outside that area. Disrupted food supply chains and panic buying stimulated short-term food shortages, emptied municipal food stores and meant that supplies often failed to meet local needs. This insecurity left mountain municipalities increasingly vulnerable to desertification. The most food-insecure areas are those that depend heavily on the tourism sector and those with limited access to food retail facilities or other organized forms of food supply in proximity. Their challenges through the period of Covid-19 have heightened questions about their access to food and possible initiatives to increase their food self-sufficiency. Among the initiatives most frequently debated in that period, gardening has been highly valued. This paper contributes to the debate by presenting a Decision Support System (DSS) that calculates the land required for food self-sufficiency in South Tyrolean municipalities and the percentage covered by the production of local urban gardens. The results demonstrate that urban gardens' contribution to local food self-sufficiency is almost insignificant in these municipalities, representing less than 1 % of the municipal needs. Restricting the analysis to self-sufficiency in fruit and vegetable production only, findings derived from the DSS application confirm the insignificance of urban gardens' production levels, which remains below 1 % of the municipal needs.",Urban gardening,Food self-sufficiency,South Tyrol,Food desert,Covid-19,Mountain municipalities,HEALTHY FOOD,DESERTS,ACCESS,ENVIRONMENT,COMMUNITY,IMPACT,DIET,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To fill this gap, we leverage a large human mobility dataset to track a year of park visitation by residents across the Phoenix, AZ, metropolitan area combined with a spatial autoregressive model using spatially lagged dependent variables. Our results suggest that it is not vegetation but the presence of water features within a park that encourages higher visitation to local parks.

Mobility paths and policies are imbued with a contested understanding of socialist legacies as well as capitalist realities. The Special Issue explores how transport options and choices confront citizens with social diversity, transformations of social norms, institutions and routines, values, concepts, and traditions. Valuable lessons can be learnt in terms of critical mobility geographies beyond the region as post-socialist transformations address justice and changing social norms and understandings of state roles. A decolonial inspiration that challenges existing readings of the formerly socialist region and transgresses the analytical ""Othering"" of its transition experience can be traced throughout the papers. Instead of arguing whether or not post-socialism is still a valid analytical framework, authors see the region as marked by multiple experiences of modernity and coloniality. In the former Soviet peripheries, urban mobility shapes socio-spatial contentions, making visible multiple and conflicting narratives of modernity and coloniality, tracing flows and dependencies at different scales, and taking into account complex constellations of actors, cultures, and materialities. The post-socialist lens is meant to critically scrutinize continuities and changes, providing particular interpretations for contemporary issues: mobile post-socialist publics are thus a turn away from what was before but in a context in which a strong relation to the past is embedded in several continuities in institutions, materialities, and practices.",Mobility,transport,post-socialism,publics,TRANSPORT,MOBILITY,GENDER,POLITICS,TRAVEL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, the spatial distribution and the variety of amenities at the local scale represent an important feature of the liveliness of places. The local availability and access to essential services are particularly relevant for some demographic groups experiencing limited mobility or mobility poverty, such as older adults living in cities, and spatial disparities have been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlighted severe difficulties in accessing essential services. This work explores the issue focussing on the following question: who can access what depending on where they live in cities? Using Machine Learning and Spatial Autocorrelation applied to different data sources for spatial information on the location of urban amenities and Internet access, this work aims to identify the most underserved places in terms of the variety of available amenities and access to quality broadband in three European capital cities. A comparison to urban areas where high percentages of older adults reside makes it possible to identify where residents can locally access several essential services (green spaces, health care, and local shopping) and where this need cannot be satisfied because of a lack in the amenity variety available at walking distance to their home. The combination of underserved areas with a high concentration of senior residents identifies left-behind areas in these cities, where interventions on inequalities are most needed. Results can inform policies aiming at favouring fair access to services at the local scale, possibly including slow and active mobility modes, and in general to develop comprehensive and sustainable planning strategies for cities, leaving no place and no person behind.",Inequalities,ageing,amenities,digital,left-behind,OLDER,ASSOCIATION,TRAVEL,ENVIRONMENT,ADULTS,LIFE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Row_841,"Buckle, C (Buckle, Caitlin) [1]",Seeking 'home' through counter-urban migration to coastal Australia,AUSTRALIAN GEOGRAPHER,OCT 2 2022,3,"Many motives for undertaking a counter-urban move appear to be associated with a search for a sense of 'home', such as moving for a sense of community, for affordable or larger housing, perceptions of a 'safer' area for children, or moving to a childhood hometown. However, rarely is counter-urban migration directly linked to the concept of home. In this paper, I make the direct link between counter-urban moves and the search for a sense of home using biographies of four (4) counter-urban movers to the Sunshine Coast, Australia. The participants each moved to the area in a search for a sense of home related to four key themes: housing, family, stability and familiarity, however they varied in their pre-move experiences and expectations of how the Sunshine Coast would improve their sense of home. These differences impacted their post-move experiences, as those participants with prior familiarity with the Sunshine Coast felt a greater sense of home post-move. This paper provides an important conceptual link between the search for a sense of home and counterurbanisation, to add further critical insight into motivations and experiences of counter-urban migrants, and the perceptions of a sense of home being better achieved outside of major cities..",Home,counterurbanisation,Australia,migration,lifestyle,seachange,mobility,LIFE-STYLE MIGRATION,PROCESS VIEW,POLITICS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We define user communities as groups of users that share common mobility features over spatio-temporal scales of arbitrary length, such as time spent in certain locales, mobility speed, and time between consecutive movements. We describe our user community identification framework in detail including how mobility features can be extracted from real mobility traces (as examples of unlabelled data) and synthetic mobility records (as examples of labeled data). We present results obtained when using our approach in four distinct mobility scenarios represented by both unlabeled and labeled datasets. We also introduce a new validation methodology that uses image-based similarity metrics in order to assess the quality of identified communities. Our results show that the proposed approach significantly increases similarity between users within the same community as well as dissimilarity between users in different communities. We also demonstrate that the proposed user community identification approach yields significant increase in contact time amongst users belonging to the same community when compared to the average contact time when not considering community structures.",Trajectory,Global Positioning System,Wireless fidelity,Social networking (online),Smart cities,Feature extraction,Urban planning,Clustering methods,principal component analysis,geospatial analysis,pattern analysis,unsupervised learning,mobile applications,TRANSPORTATION MODES,GPS DATA,INTERNET,,,,,,,,,,

From the perspective of Urban Studies, this issue has been addressed from the experience of young people in their journeys to their places of study and the modes of transport they use. However, addressing it is still a challenge for this process from a perspective inscribed in mobility biographies, that is to say, with attention to the changes they experience in their mobility. In this work, changes in the urban mobility of young people are identified, specifically, changes in modes of transportation and in the space of social activities during the process of transition to university of young people in the Metropolitan Region of Santiago. To this end, the results of a self-administered survey of young people who started university in undergraduate programs in 2023 are reported. The results show that those who start university undergo changes that make the modes of transportation and social activities more sensitive at the neighborhood and municipal scale; that the changes affect socialization, leisure, and recreation activities carried out by young people more; and that the repertoire of activities from starting university is experienced differently according to gender, family group income, sector of residence, and location of the study campus. This work offers an opportunity to problematize how the transition to university is conceived from the perspective of mobilities at a metropolitan scale.",Mobility biographies,urban campus,activity space,university student,transport modes,urban mobility,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to movement constraints that result in local economic patterns, individual mobility patterns are expected to occur. However, this matter needs further investigation from people's spatial behaviour during the RMCO. Therefore, this research proposed a new technique for analysing people's spatial behaviour patterns via geo-tagged data. The data from social media users are gathered using data mining techniques. Geographical Information System (GIS) is used to show the geolocation of social media users and analyse their spatial behaviour. The finding of this analysis shows higher people's movement recorded when the RMCO was enforced; a distinctive pattern where spatial trajectory length is high but spatial area coverage is low.

Increasing urban heat has made high density housing units a vulnerability hotspot. Alternatives to extended air-conditioning are required. This research sought evidence on using urban parks as a sustainable alternative by low-income households deprived of adequate living space. We interviewed occupants of tiny flats (approx. 10 m(2)), known as subdivided units, and compared their park visiting routines and thermal comfort practices with other urban dwellers in Hong Kong. The substandard conditions of these small units have contributed to dwellers' sensitivity and lower capacity to adapt to summer heat, resulting in heat-related illness. The space-poor households have taken a wider range of adaptive actions and visited urban parks more frequently for cooling. Their higher mobility between home and nearby parks has shortened their home-stay time that would otherwise demand residential space cooling. The findings are important for reconsidering and redressing the uneven distribution of urban green spaces. Poor housing conditions and heat stress have forced disadvantaged households to seek refuge from natural cool spaces, such as vegetated and shaded areas of urban parks. Measures for increasing their accessibility, availability and capacity for heat mitigation are conducive to pro-poor and pro-climate spatial planning.",Urban park,Substandard housing,Pro-poor planning,Air conditioning,Thermal comfort,Climate change adaptation,CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION,GREEN SPACE,THERMAL COMFORT,INFRASTRUCTURE,PERCEPTION,COMMUNITY,CAPACITY,BENEFITS,DENSITY,ISLAND,,,,,,,,,,

Advancements in machine learning algorithms open up new horizons to face these challenges. This research proposes a supervised machine learning approach, Random Forest, for population density appraisal in a large and dense developing city. We studied Bogota, where functional integration with neighboring municipalities exists, although they have different governments and uncoordinated urban development plans. As a starting point, we use simulated residential land-use patterns, classified according to socioeconomic levels, from a cellular automata-based model. We estimate population density with reliable land-use change models and nine simple representations of the urban structure, such as land values and the distance to urban amenities. Therefore, combining a cellular automata model with a classification model, considering both continuous and categorical variables, demonstrates this methodology's potential and promises a reliable assessment of population density. Finally, we present a trip generation model integrated with densities and spatial location.

This work involves adapting and optimizing the YOLO v3 model to accurately identify and count vehicles passing through the roundabout. The aim is to measure traffic volume and identify circulation trends, which are crucial for understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of vehicles. The collected data not only estimate the number of EVs likely to traverse this area but also predict the needs for charging infrastructure in and around this specific roundabout. Our prototype demonstrated high accuracy in vehicle counting, allowing detailed analysis of traffic patterns at different times of the day. This analysis reveals significant variations in traffic flows, providing valuable insights into the most suitable times and locations for installing EV charging stations. While this study focuses on a single roundabout, it establishes a precedent for using advanced deep learning techniques in assessing EV charging infrastructure needs in broader urban contexts.

Urban road networks play a pivotal role in shaping intricate urban spatial patterns as they intricately weave throughout the cityscape, significantly influencing land utilization, spatial arrangements, and the mobility of residents. The urban environment is a complex system teeming with multifaceted human activities. With the continuous evolution of advanced data and computational technologies, it is now feasible to construct intricate models for an in-depth exploration of urban spatial structures. In this study, we constructed an analytical framework that leveraged road network image recognition, multi-scale influence factors analysis, and predictions using codeless visual programming. Within this framework, deep learning and unsupervised clustering are applied to complete the hierarchical clustering of road networks and exploit the intrinsic association between cities. Meanwhile, hierarchical clustering and natural and humanistic attributes of cities are connected to investigate the strength of different attributes on specific clusters. The research has the following results: (1) In addition to the alignment of urban road network clustering outcomes, quantitative unevenness and geographical heterogeneity are also observed. (2) Multiple attributes have a complicated impact on urban space, including city size, and socioeconomic and geographic characteristics. Among these factors, socio-economic variables emerge as the principal drivers influencing urban spatial structure. (3) The research enhances the model's generalization capability and predictive accuracy.

The focus of the analysis is on whether and how the policies used to pilot and implement EMM and other shared mobility systems address equity concerns. Our results reveal that cities at the forefront of piloting EMM systems have provided useful lessons to others further behind the implementation curve. These lessons are of many types, including co-learning with other agencies, conducting research and pilots in advance of developing and enacting EMM policies or service models, and responding to equity demands. Our findings also suggest that policies for EMM devices tend to over-rely on public safety concerns to motivate their enactment.
