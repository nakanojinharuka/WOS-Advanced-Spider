Row_2,"Most urban green space (UGS) studies focus on city-level analysis, which is not conducive to urban renewal. We developed a new deep learning approach for characterising the structural evolution of block-scale UGS in urban renewal scenarios. Taking Beijing and Shanghai as models, we first segmented the study areas into block-scale grids and trained a random forest model based on a local climate zone framework to identify the spatial morphological classes of the grids. Second, we established a VGG16-based deep learning model to identify UGS structural types. Finally, we examined the associated patterns of grid spatial morphology and UGS structure under different renewal scenarios. We found that six distinct types of UGS structure are associated with different urban morphological classes. Spatial and temporal variations of UGS structures were observed in terms of direction of conversion, activity level, and extent of improvement to service level. Holistic and micro-renewal approaches drove positive evolution of block-scale UGS structures mainly by reducing building density and via precise optimization, respectively. Our results provide a reference for urban renewal policies and planning guidelines for block-scale UGSs in high-density cities.","Zhou, Conghui","Zhang, Shining","Liu, Bowen","Li, Tianjiao","Shi, Jixin","Zhan, Huiying",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,CITIES,Deep learning,Green space,Structure,Urban morphology,Urban planning,Urban renewal,,,,,,,,,JUL 2024,Using deep learning to unravel the structural evolution of block-scale green spaces in urban renewal
Row_9,"Improving living conditions, quality of public services and social safety nets in blighted and underdeveloped urban areas also are important aspects of urban renewal. In another way, achieving sustainable urban development requires more improvements. Equity, sustainability, and universality are core principles of sustainable development and should be integrated into urban renewal strategies. For instance, urban renewal in old town areas presents multiple challenges, including balancing public investment needs, social justice considerations, and environmental impacts. Studies have shown that inequalities often arise during implementation, disproportionately affecting low-income residents in old town areas. While energy justice is a key concept for reducing these inequalities during renewal process, however existing frameworks lack a multi-dimensional approach. This study proposes a comprehensive evaluation framework that combines sustainable development with energy justice principles during the renewal of old town areas. This framework aims to achieve equitable and sustainable development outcomes in renewal of old urban areas by systematically examining the unequal impacts on lowincome groups and proposing equitable energy services and inclusive policies. The proposed equity evaluation framework includes two key components: 1) Main factors in existing renewal strategies, which include equitable access to energy resources, sustainable energy systems, affordability, and public participation. 2) Criteria for refining energy justice evaluation framework, which include accessibility, energy efficiency, community participation, and policy coordination. The research emphasizes the importance of fairness in providing affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy opportunities within urban renewal initiatives. This focus can provide rational perspective and reference for decision makers, thereby empowering vulnerable groups, giving equitable energy access and contributing to achieve sustainable urban development.","Cui, Dingyue","Ditta, Asim A.","Cao, Shi-Jie",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,Sustainable development,Energy justice,Urban renewal,Low-income groups,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 25 2024,Energy justice and sustainable urban renewal: A systematic review of low-income old town communities
Row_11,"In the process of rapid urban renewal, quantitative research on functional preferences and spatial layout norms of multi-type urban renewal entities is crucial for optimizing spatial governance and promoting orderly control of urban renewal. We investigate urban renewal in Beijing from 2006 to 2021 using directional distribution, spatial autocorrelation, and hotspot analysis. The findings are as follows: (1) The functional preference of each type of entity differs. While most private companies and other profit-oriented entities concentrate on producer services and residential functions, policy-oriented entities dominate the urban regeneration of public service activities. (2) Every entity shows a significant agglomeration characteristic, yet exhibits a differentiated spatial response pattern. Those entities with stronger leasing ability prefer the central zone while others are the opposite. (3) Diverse types of entities have differentiated spatiotemporal evolutions. The spatial directional divergence of state-owned enterprises and scientific research institutes has increased between 2006 and 2021. This is mainly influenced by the policy of relieving Beijing of nonessential functions. However, the rest entities show a balanced spatial development trend with the difference in each direction becoming smaller. Furthermore, the center of gravity of profit-oriented entities has shifted from the suburbs to the central zone due to a combination of administrative and market forces, whereas the center of gravity of policy-oriented entities tends to move outward from the central zone.","Xu, Shan","Liu, Boya",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,HABITAT INTERNATIONAL,Urban renewal,Entity types,Functional preference,Spatial evolution,Influencing factors,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2024,Functional preference and spatial response of urban renewal entities in Beijing
Row_18,"Urban renewal is imperative due to growing urbanization (i.e., population migration into cities), requiring acceptable planning to meet peoples' housing needs and playing a key role in highlighting and satisfying societies' needs. Complex urban renewal decisions encompass environmental degradation, poverty, inequality, and inaccessibility to services. Decision makers must meet on -going challenges by transforming urban spaces so that they satisfy all constraints while satisfying residents' needs. A holistic view of urban renewal facilitates efficient strategies for meeting economic, social, and environmental obligations. Multicriteria methodology may ideally be used to develop a complete, transparent, and realistic model that identifies planning factors best resolving urban renewal efforts. Therefore, we rely on cognitive mapping, the decision -making trial and evaluation laboratory technique, and neutrosophic logic, applied by a panel of experts with experience in urban renewal planning in two group work meetings. The results were analyzed and validated by an independent specialist in this field. The contributions and limitations of this methodological framework were also examined.","Cordeiro, Tiago A.

Row_22,"The prevailing paradigm of traditional top-down urban renewal has been criticized for failing to consider diverse public requests and preferences. This critique has prompted a ""human-centric"" approach, emphasizing effective two-way communication within urban renewal. Despite this shift, there remains a significant gap in research on real-time public opinions generated from bottom-up participation in urban renewal, particularly with regard to governmental response to such micro-level feedback. Therefore, based on provincial-level panel data and microlevel opinions on the Leaders' Message Board, this research adopted a text mining method and regression model to evaluate unstructured user-generated data and explore the determinants of government responsiveness in urban renewal. The results reveal that there are more public opinions on urban renewal in economically developed regions than in less developed regions. This study also found that local governments can respond to most public opinions. Meanwhile, ""project progress inquiry"", ""quality problem"", and economic level have significant positive impacts on response timeliness, while ""information disclosure"" and ""livelihood issues"" have adverse effects.

Urbanization that takes place without taking into account these legal and technical bases lead to the emergence of informal, risky and dysfunctional settlements. Over time, these settlements become increasingly vulnerable due to their failure to meet social and technical requirements, making their sustainability increasingly challenging, and inevitably becoming subjects of urban renewal activities. Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform's archive of satellite images provides temporal monitoring of urbanization on Earth for about 50 years and analysis of changes in the cloud environment. This study investigates whether the GEE platform can use to detect the impact of the areas where settlement activities are carried out without a development plan in the current urban transformation projects in Istanbul. Land use/cover maps classified with the Random Forest algorithm correlate urbanization activities in urban renewal areas with the entry into force date of the spatial plans that guide the settlement. The classification results evaluated in conjunction with statistical tests and spatial plan decisions demonstrate that unplanned urbanization is a serious obstacle to the sustainability of settlements. Additionally, the study results show the performance of the GEE platform in detecting the effects of factors in the urbanization period.

Institutional co-production and actornetwork theory were employed in two cases in Shanghai to analyse relationships between administrative departments, policy implementors, and residents. The findings show that while institutional co-production promoted substantial spatial change for elderly residents, and stimulated both administrative change and bottom-up initiatives. However the need for the state to provide a bottom line for more vulnerable actors was highlighted, an over-representation of dominant actors and uneven information assembly in the process also resulted in unequal distributions of benefits among actors.

As rapid urbanization continues to be a global challenge, the economic impacts of different urban revitalization strategies hold crucial importance in informed urban planning and policymaking. This study uses a spatial hedonic approach to analyze the influence of distinct urban renewal and regeneration initiatives on land values. The results reveal that the urban renewal project, which involves significant physical upgrades and redevelopment, appears to substantially increase land prices. However, a deeper analysis accounting for spatial spillover effects indicates that most of this increase is due to the influence of high-value adjacent areas. Conversely, urban regeneration projects, which focus on enhancing the socioeconomic and cultural aspects of urban areas without causing drastic physical changes, consistently have a significant positive impact on land prices, even when spatial structures are considered. This study underscores that urban planners and policymakers should carefully evaluate the type of urban revitalization strategy to be implemented and its contextual spatial effects. The findings suggest that urban regeneration can be a more effective tool than urban renewal for sustainable urban improvement, contributing to enhanced land utility and neighborhood development. These insights are particularly valuable for cities in developed and developing countries facing similar urban challenges.","Gu, Hanmin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,CITIES,Urban revitalization,Urban renewal,Urban regeneration,Neighborhood development,Land prices,Hedonic pricing model,Spatial hedonic approach,,,,,,,,NOV 2024,"Differential impacts of urban revitalization projects on land prices: A case study of Seongnam, South Korea"
Row_38,"Urban pluvial flooding mitigation is a significant challenge in city development. Many mature methods have been used to reduce the risk of flood. The optimal design of impervious surfaces (ODIS) is an adaptive solution to urban flooding from the perspective of urban renewal planning. However, existing ODIS models are limited because they do not consider the drainage systems. To address this issue, this study proposes an elastic and controllable optimization model based on assumptions about rainstorm and drainage capacity, nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II), multivariate linear programming (MLP) and soil conservation service curve number model (SCS-CN) in a case study of the old town of Guangzhou city, China. The model not only coupled the drainage systems, but also collaboratively optimized the impervious surfaces and the drainage systems. The results show that the proposed model achieved an optimized efficiency of 5.70 %, which is more than a tenfold improvement compared to existing ODIS models. The study emphasizes that the optimization of the drainage system should be the focus and the optimization of impervious surfaces should be supplementary, and different flood risk areas require different optimization strategies. Furthermore, transforming impervious surfaces into a ""high-low-high"" spatial distribution of impervious surface densities is the optimal design solution for impervious surfaces.

However, the huge funding gap, coupled with the unwillingness of enterprises to participate, has impeded the sustainable development of OCR in China. This issue has become a major practical challenge for the government. This study employed the modified theory of planned behavior (M-TPB) to examine enterprise behavior, focusing on how internal capabilities and external conditions influence their participation. Data was collected from 261 questionnaire surveys, and structured equation modeling was used to analyze the data. Further in-depth interviews were conducted to explain and validate the results from the SEM. The findings illustrate that: (1) the M-TPB offers a more detailed and nuanced explanation of the mechanisms influencing participation behavior; (2) the attitude towards participation is an important factor in shaping the intention to participate; (3) there is a significant negative correlation between perceived behavioral control, which is based on external conditions, and the participation intention; and (4) different types of enterprises show differences in attitude and perceived behavioral control.

This helps reveal how urban form evolution impacts the thermal environment. Previous research often used isolated images, ignoring the temporal dimension of thermal infrared and reflectance data from Landsat sensors. Additionally, cost-effective and efficient methods for reconstructing time-series built height are lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, we utilized Landsat time-series data to reconstruct the yearly trends in urban form in Beijing, China, spanning from 1990 to 2020. Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) time series analysis method was used to identify urban growth and renewal years. Employing a reference height for 2020 and logical reasoning method, we reconstructed the annual dynamics of built-up heights, pinpointing years of significant change. Finally, we analyzed the alterations in urban form over the past three decades and their impact on surface temperature changes. Our change detection method achieved an overall accuracy of 86 %, demonstrating its effectiveness in determining the year of change. When compared with data from Lianjia and LiDAR point cloud, our height reconstruction method showed impressive accuracy, with R-2 values of 0.9773 and 0.9526, respectively. Analysis of summer and winter LST values revealed distinct temperature patterns across different building heights, with mid-rise buildings exhibiting the highest LST in summer and low-rise buildings registering the highest LST in winter. During periods of urban growth, both mean and amplitude values of LST increased, while during urban renewal (demolition), they decreased. The date of annual temperature peaks advanced during urban growth but delayed during urban renewal (demolition). Our time series analysis framework offers a new method for understanding the yearly dynamics of urban form and its influence on surface temperature, with potential applications in carbon emission and urban climate modeling studies.","Liang, Ying","Cao, Shisong","Mo, You","Du, Mingyi","Wang, Xudong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION,Urban growth,Urban renewal,Height dynamics,Time-series surface temperature,Temporal thermal signature,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2024,Characterizing annual dynamics of two- and three-dimensional urban structures and their impact on land surface temperature using dense time-series Landsat images

Following stricter building codes, the district underwent significant demolition and construction between 2014 and 2015. We employ construction data and credit card transaction data to analyze the demographic changes. We find that urban regeneration due to building renewal may have diverse context-dependent effects on the demographic tapestry of communities, their culture and history. While some neighborhoods showed positive response to increased local amenities and resulted in reduced mobility outside their local area, leading to greater income segregation from the rest of the city, others behaved in the opposite direction. Similarly, the transformation process has attracted a more educated and higher-income inflow of residents in some neighborhoods compared to others. Herein, we employ new big data and mobility-driven metrics from computational social science such as diversity, loyalty and assortativity to reveal the link between urban regeneration and segregation. Our findings provide important clues and insights to urban planners for developing urban policies leading to neighborhood designs that are more connected to each other (hence reducing segregation) while still offering modern amenities expected by their residents.","Seyedkazemi, Seyedpayam","Dass, Zuhal Ozbay","Ozbay, Ayse Elif Ozsoy","Bozkaya, Burcin","Balcisoy, Selim",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,CITIES,Urban regeneration,Gentrification,Economic segregation,Purchase activities,Building renewal,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,Can financial transactions reveal the change in social fabric triggered by urban regeneration?

This paper proposes the hypothesis that governance structure and institution affect the functional system and adaptability of the community, and forms a framework of structural-institutional-functional adaptation. Using comparative analysis of cases from different governance structures and self-organizing foundations. The government governance structure and weak self-organization foundation of Hongmei community form the dependence on the government to improve the functional system. Qicai Community is a market governance structure, which realizes multi-functional adaptability in design, but the weak self-organization foundation increases the cost of operation and institution. Hemu Community is a multi-agent structure based on the self-organization institution, which improves the multi-functional adaptability under the cooperation of self-organization and the government. The case comparison shows that the governance structure and institutional adaptability are the basis of functional adaptation, which together constitute the system adaptability. From the perspective of CAS, the bottom-up self-organization structure has more flexible adaptability. The multi-agent governance structure based on the self-organization is more conducive to the improvement of functional adaptability. But market and government mechanisms each have their own irreplaceable roles.

In order to facilitate the optimization of renewal timing and strategy from the perspective of reducing the comprehensive global warming impacts, we put forward the low-carbon bridge renewal decision method referring to the ideas of consequential life cycle assessment (LCA) and dynamic LCA. In the proposed method, a comparative system boundary matching the bridge renewal characteristics is constructed, where the carbon emission reduction owing to the traffic efficiency improvement by functional updating is incorporated as the lowcarbon benefits of renewal, and three types of time-dependent factors, i.e., time-dependent characterization factor, trend factors and changes of traffic demands, are introduced to characterize the influence of renewal timing. The proposed method provided guidance for the renewal of Maogang Bridge, the first long-span cablestayed bridge in Shanghai. Results illustrate that the global warming impacts of renewal construction activities and the low-carbon benefits from functional updating decrease with the renewal timing. For Maogang Bridge, the rapidly increasing traffic demands inevitably advocated renewal in advance, and the reduction of global warming impacts from emission reduction or carbon uptake could be manifested for renewal in advance. Adopting material recycling in the disposal of old bridge helped reconstructing a new bridge while deconstructing the old one in 2019 becoming the finally selected low-carbon renewal strategy, which is expected to reduce 15.04 kt CO2e-2019 compared to the essential renewal in 2050 with the landfill disposal method. The robustness of the strategy choice has been justified, given the variations of analytical time horizon, expected emission trends and repair emissions.

Green urban renewal is likely to exacerbate social injustice without adequate countermeasures. Low-income groups are more likely to be displaced since their housing spending is more elastic. However, research on whether China's new environmentally responsible green urban renewal has also aggravated socioeconomic inequity is still insufficient. Using the Happiness Forest Belt (HFB, currently the largest green infrastructure regeneration project in China) in Xi'an as a case study, our study examines whether green urban renewal actions have resulted in green gentrification. By incorporating spatial effects into the difference in differences (DID) model, our estimates show that HFB significantly and dynamically stimulated the appreciation of nearby property rents. Moreover, the lower the property rents, the more intense the impact of HFB and the more likely it was to gentrify. It confirms our concern that green urban renewal would probably result in the displacement of the poor and that green initiatives aimed at common human well-being are more beneficial to the wealthy.

We address these voids by integrating the literatures of urban studies and crime and deviance to theorise the linkage between nearby gentrification and disorder policing. Using negative binomial regression models to analyse three years of arrest records from the Washington, DC Metropolitan Police Department, we find that the occurrence of gentrification in nearby block groups is associated with increased order maintenance arrests in the average block group.

The high-frequency mobility of villagers accelerates the categorization of UVs and enhances intra-area circulation. We further discussed the interaction between UV renewal and its destigmatization. To counter spatial stigmatization, enhancing the spatial quality and infrastructure of UVs, as well as promoting diversified land use can reduce the public's stereotypical impressions. Moreover, prioritizing affordable housing and equitable distribution of facilities, along with fostering synergies between urban capital and UVs, can facilitate the destigmatization process. Stigmatization in informal settlements is a widespread issue. Our quantitative approaches, as well as targeted renovation and policy recommendations, can serve as a blueprint for addressing similar challenges in informal settlements globally.","Rui, Jin","Xu, Yuhan","Li, Xiang",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,HABITAT INTERNATIONAL,Destigmatization,Urban villages,Mobility patterns,Job-housing patterns,Spatial attractiveness,,,,,,,,,,AUG 2024,Destigmatizing urban villages by examining their attractiveness: Quantification evidence from Shenzhen

Improving the pedestrian quality of service (PQOS) of riverfront streets is crucial. However, the needs of citizens for walking and daily activities are rarely considered in the riverfront streets. This paper established the evaluation system for PQOS of riverfront streets from five aspects of accessibility, attractiveness, comfort, safety and pleasure, and realized the collection and calculation of indicators through space syntax, semantic segmentation and other methods. Taking Jilin Riverfront Streets as examples, the PQOS was evaluated. Through the establishment of the coordinate system, the streets were divided into four categories: Advantage, Maintain, Opportunity and Improvement streets. The renewal strategies were proposed. The results showed that the PQOS have great room for improvement. The natural openness ratio and blue visual index of the improvement streets need to be enhanced. Most opportunity streets were located in the residential, industrial and biophilic districts. The number and types of service facilities need to be increased.

Distinct from most renewal paradigms that are usually one-offs, neighborhood rehabilitation is a long-term endeavor that requires ongoing resident participation to effectively address diverse needs, investment shortages, and governance challenges. Extant research predominantly focuses on residents' initial engagement, leaving the dynamics of continued participation and its influencing factors largely unexamined. Employing the Expectation-Confirmation Model (ECM), this study explores how residents' initial participation experiences influence their intentions to continue participation. Analyzing questionnaire responses from 367 experienced residents in Wuhan, China, the study finds that a mere 38.2 % of residents exhibit re-engage intention. Path analysis shows that initial participation experience influences residents' reengage intention indirectly through participation satisfaction and perceived usefulness. Residents' re-engage intention is most influenced by level of influence residents hold in decision-making, followed by type of activities they engage in, and stage of their initial involvement. As an exploratory study into the realm of continued participation, this research uncovers several potential pathways and policy recommendations, aiming to ease residents' transition from initial acceptance to sustained engagement in future neighborhood development efforts.","Li, Yu","Zhuang, Taozhi","Qian, Queena K.","Mlecnik, Erwin","Visscher, Henk J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,CITIES,Neighborhood rehabilitation,Urban renewal,Resident participation,Continued participation,Expectation-confirmation model (ECM),China,,,,,,,,,APR 2024,From acceptance to continuance: Understanding the influence of initial participation experience on residents' intentions to continue participation in neighborhood rehabilitation

UCSs are crucial for timely tracking of urban expansion and renewal progress, understanding settlement environments and human activities, and achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3 and 11. However, distinguishing UCSs from other land covers remains challenging, whether using spatial texture and spectral features or time-series characteristics. There is an urgent need for a universally applicable UCS mapping method at the national scale, a gap that current research has yet to fill. In this study, we proposed a method combining geospatial data with remote sensing data for national UCS mapping under medium spatial resolution. Additionally, we combine the UCS mapping results with SDGSAT-1 GLI data to evaluate the utilization status of new construction areas, thereby supporting SDG 11.3. The results showed that, for six representative cities, the F1-Score and Matthews Correlation Coefficients (MCC) for exposed UCS mapping results ranged from 98.83 % to 99.49 % and from 0.64 to 0.77, respectively. Variable importance detected in the Random Forest (RF) model highlighted that the key to identifying UCSs lay in geospatial information describing UCS spatial distribution, including distance to roads, city boundaries, and dust-proof nets. The assessment of the utilization status for new construction areas highlights the differences in the utilization status with which cities at various stages of development utilize these new areas. We then compared the ability of UCS distribution with existing impervious surface products in reflecting the dynamics of urban construction. The results showed that UCS spatial distribution could reflect urban construction patterns more timely and accurately, providing key insights for urban planners. Overall, this study provides a universal methodology that can be referenced for mapping land covers that have low separability in spectral and textural features in complex urban environments. The proposed method offers a cost-effective and reliable way to map nationwide UCS distribution, providing clear and timely spatial information for urban planning and achieving SDGs.","Zhang, Chaoqun","Chen, Ziyue","Luo, Lei","Zhu, Qiqi","Fu, Yuheng","Gao, Bingbo","Hu, Jianqiang","Cheng, Liurun","Lv, Qiancheng","Yang, Jing","Li, Manchun","Zhou, Lei","Wang, Qiao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT,Urban construction site (UCS),SDGSAT-1,Geospatial data,National-scale mapping,Urbanization,,,,,,,,,,DEC 15 2024,Mapping urban construction sites in China through geospatial data fusion: Methods and applications

Therefore, exploring the relationship between urban street planning and human perception, especially restorative perception, is crucial for sustainable urban planning. In this study, we analyzed restorative perception of urban streets among different population groups and accessibility of urban streets using Baidu Street View Images, deep learning, and space syntax. Furthermore, we clarified the impacts of various street elements on restorative perception using correlation and ridge regression analyses. Based on restorative perception and accessibility coupling assessment, streets were classified into four types, identifying ""inefficient segments"" and ""prioritized segments"". The results showed that: 1) the level of restorative perception of streets in Nanjing was relatively limited and exhibited variation across different population groups; 2) the impacts of different street elements on restorative perception varied, with trees having the highest positive impact (beta = 0.378), while walls had the greatest negative impact (beta = - 0.182); and 3) ""prioritized segments"" and ""inefficient segments"" represented 33.92 % and 17.96 %, respectively, indicating the urgent demand for streets planning and renewal.

Row_140,"The global urbanization trend is geographically manifested through city expansion and the renewal of internal urban structures and functions. Time-series urban land use (ULU) maps are vital for capturing dynamic land changes in the urbanization process, giving valuable insights into urban development and its environmental consequences. Recent studies have mapped ULU in some cities with a unified model, but ignored the regional differences among cities; and they generated ULU maps year by year, but ignored temporal correlations between years; thus, they could be weak in large-scale and long time-series ULU monitoring. Accordingly, we introduce an temporal-spatial-semantic collaborative (TSS) mapping framework to generating accurate ULU maps with considering regional differences and temporal correlations. Firstly, to support model training, a large-scale ULU sample dataset based on OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Sentinel-2 imagery is automatically constructed, providing a total number of 56,412 samples with a size of 512 x 512 which are divided into six sub-regions in China and used for training different classification models. Then, an urban land use mapping network (ULUNet) is proposed to recognize ULU. This model utilizes a primary and an auxiliary encoder to process noisy OSM samples and can enhance the model's robustness under noisy labels. Finally, taking the temporal correlations of ULU into consideration, the recognized ULU are optimized, whose boundaries are unified by a time-series co-segmentation, and whose categories are modified by a knowledge-data driven method. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we consider all urban areas in China (254,566 km2), and produce a time-series China urban land use dataset (CULU) at a 10-m resolution, spanning from 2016 to 2022, with an overall accuracy of CULU is 82.42%. Through comparison, it can be found that CULU outperforms existing datasets such as EULUC-China and UFZ-31cities in data accuracies, spatial boundaries consistencies and land use transitions logicality. The results indicate that the proposed method and generated dataset can play important roles in land use change monitoring, ecological-environmental evolution analysis, and also sustainable city development.","Xiong, Shuping","Zhang, Xiuyuan","Lei, Yichen","Tan, Ge","Wang, Haoyu","Du, Shihong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT,Urbanization,Land use,Time-series mapping,China urban land use dataset (CULU),,,,,,,,,,,OCT 1 2024,Time-series China urban land use mapping (2016-2022): An approach for achieving spatial-consistency and semantic-transition rationality in temporal domain

The findings revealed that Tangshan and Zhangzhou can be classified as high-pressure and low-resilience cities; Lianyungang and Huizhou as highpressure and medium-resilience cities; Dalian and Ningbo as medium-pressure and medium-resilience cities; and Shanghai as a low-pressure and high-resilience city. From 2012 to 2019, the UER of PPCs exhibited a fluctuating upward trend. However, most cities can currently only withstand single petrochemical environmental pressures and are incapable of managing the CEPs of the petrochemical industry. Except for Shanghai, the UER of all cities is below the average level of 0.106. The implementation of cleaner production and the green petrochemical industry's scale have not yet met the policy expectations set by authorities. Moreover, major ecological initiatives and policy regulations are lagging, relative to the pace of the development of petrochemical industries. Key environmental pressure sources from the petrochemical industry were identified: reinforced dependence on petrochemical fuels (0.0393), high carbon emissions from the petrochemical industry (0.0335), and the instability of fossil energy supplies (0.0328). Insufficient environmental resistance (-0.068) and delayed renewal capacity (0.041) have been identified as weak links limiting the UER of PPCs. Strengthening environmental protection projects, improving urban infrastructure, and controlling petrochemical industry risks were projected as common focal points and effective environmental measures for all PPCs to manage long-term threats and sudden CEPs from the petrochemical industry.","Tian, Chuang","Liang, Yahui","Lin, Qiaoqiao","You, Dongni","Liu, Zun",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,Petrochemical industry,Compound environmental pressures,Multi-source data fusion,Urban environmental resilience,Sustainable cities,,,,,,,,,,SEP 15 2024,Environmental pressure exerted by the petrochemical industry and urban environmental resilience: Evidence from Chinese petrochemical port cities
Row_171,"The conflict between public and private interests has become a focal point of contention among various parties in the process of expropriation and relocation for historic urban regeneration. Failures to properly resolve such conflict often lead to impeded urban regeneration and/or loss of cultural values. Although previous studies have analyzed the mediating role of various types of indirect stakeholders in historic urban regeneration, they have not further examined various effects of indirect stakeholders. Inspired by the theories of dependence, deterrence, and agency among stakeholders, this study explains the different effects of indirect stakeholders on the three parties (government, developers, and residents) following the evolutionary game theory. Specifically, replicator dynamics equations are established to simulate the evolution paths of the government, developers, and residents in the tripartite game involving indirect stakeholders through a case study for the historic regeneration of Zhongshan Road in Nanning, China. Modeling parameters are obtained through semi-structured interviews and quantified analyses of policy documents. The results reveal that indirect stakeholders (1) show a positive ally effect benefiting the stability of government strategies, (2) have a negative deterrent effect conducive to the stable evolution of developers, and (3) have an indirect leverage effect on the evolution of residents. Our study makes contributions by (1) designing a new indirect stakeholder mechanism to urban regeneration, and (2) establishing a new analysis framework for the tripartite game in urban regeneration. Although the case study is conducted in the context of China, the analytical framework is applicable to other countries.","Zhong, Jimin","Li, Bin","Shen, Guoqiang","Zhou, Long",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,CITIES,Historic urban regeneration,Indirect stakeholder,Evolutionary game theory,Replicator dynamic system,Ally,deterrence,or leverage effects,,,,,,,,JUN 2024,"Ally, deterrence, or leverage in the tripartite game?

The integration of dual-use public infrastructure stands at the forefront of planning initiatives to enhance urban flood resilience. This study introduces a pioneering Smart Water Plaza (SWP) system, orchestrated by predictive algorithms, to mitigate pluvial floods. A high-risk old neighborhood (4.5 km2) in Changsha, China, is selected as a case for empirical analysis. Two types of SWPs-in-situ detention, and runoffreceiving units-are initially established based on spatial mapping and potential analysis. The core feature of the SWP system is a multi-horizon 2D-1D model predictive control (MPC), which directly verifies the suitability of terrain configurations and evaluates temporal efficiency. The study plots the performance curves of the SWPs under various design rainfalls and demonstrates flood dynamics using an actual torrential event. The findings indicate that SWPs' resilience contribution index for the stormwater system ranges from 9 % to 38 %. Furthermore, SWPs covering only 5 % of the site lead to an obvious decrease in flooded areas, with reductions ranging from 46 % to 48 %.

Row_202,"The process of sustainable urban development is accompanied by frequent and complex land cover changes, and thus, clarify accurate information on land cover changes can provide scientific data for urban management. To characterize urban development at an accurate spatiotemporal scale, a change detection model is not only required to provide accurate location (Where) and time (When) of the changes, but also semantic information on the change types (What). Accordingly, this study proposed a deep learning method for temporal semantic segmentation change detection (TSSCD) that obtains information on the where, when, and what of changes simultaneously. TSSCD model bridges the semantic gap between remote sensing time series abrupt changes and land cover changes by learning the month-to-month mapping from spectral information to land cover types. We implemented a temporal semantic segmentation model based on the most classic fully convolutional network, where all two-dimensional convolutions and pooling operations were replaced with one-dimensional. We conducted tests on the TSSCD in several urban study areas, and it consistently exhibited good accuracy. In most cases, it outperformed the BFAST and CCDC algorithms, except when only a single spectral band was used. Simultaneously, we analyzed the minimum data requirements for training a TSSCD. The TSSCD currently faces challenges in achieving strong generalization beyond the training data distribution. Additionally, we observed that change detection for specific land cover types can be achieved through the flexible configuration of TSSCD. Finally, we explored a method for constructing datasets using existing products to minimize data annotation efforts, yielding promising results. However, there is still some gap compared to complete manual annotation.

Reusing waste CO2 to make new construction materials produces circular carbon flows and constitutes a key step toward a carbon-negative economy. To establish a holistic view of the field, this paper examines upscaled technologies with industrial deployments for utilizing CO2 in manufacturing cement-based materials and analyzes their interplay for attaining net-zero emissions (NZE) in the concrete sector. By scrutinizing the status quo, it suggests that NZE agendas should be diversified catering to the wide-ranging built products. Small-sized precast elements and lightweight components lead the way in carbon-neutral manufacturing, while the market-dominating ready-mix concrete is by far difficult to decarbonize and relies on the incorporation of pre-carbonated ingredients, preferably sourced from alkaline wastes, to leverage large-scale CO2 utilization. To expedite the race to NZE, it is necessary to combine the development of CO2 utilization and low-CO2 cement to create decarbonization strategies tailoring for individual products.

However, with the extensive construction of infrastructure and rapid expansion of cities, the road updating process is imperative to maintain the high quality of current basic geographic information. Currently, road extraction and change detection are two commonly used methods to solve road updating problems. Most of the existing methods rely on a large number of accurate road labels to generate road information while ignoring the use of quantities of available but incomplete road maps. In our work, we proposed a semisupervised road extraction method specifically for road-updating applications [semi-supervised road updating network (SRUNet)]. In this approach, historical road maps are fused with the latest remote sensing images, and the state of the roads is updated directly. A multibranch network is the core of the method, which consists of three noteworthy parts: the map encoding branch (MEB) proposed for representation learning, the boundary enhancement module (BEM) for improving the accuracy of boundary prediction, and the residual refinement module (RRM) for further optimizing the prediction results. We applied our method to two datasets: the DeepGlobe public dataset and our self-constructed dataset from Zhengzhou and Nanjing. Experimental results show that our method achieves an improvement of 14.37% over the baseline approach. Notably, the addition of historical maps improved the model's performance by 12.4%.

The win-win agreement, particularly concerning rising rent fees between tenants and owners within the commercial area revealed the positive potential role in softening gentrification effects.","Seomun, Gyu","Kim, Hyun","Woosnam, Kyle Maurice","Kim, Hyewon",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,CITIES,Commercial gentrification,Governance,Rent gap,Social capital,Win-win agreement,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2024,Commercial gentrification revisited: Social capital and community governance in regenerated neighborhoods of South Korea
Row_304,"Gentrification is a complex and context-specific process that involves changes in the built environment and social fabric of neighborhoods, often resulting in the displacement of vulnerable communities. Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful predictive tool that is capable of circumventing the methodological challenges that historically held back researchers from producing reliable forecasts of gentrification. Additionally, computer vision ML algorithms for landscape character assessment, or deep mapping, can now capture a wider range of built metrics related to gentrification-induced redevelopment. These novel ML applications promise to rapidly progress our understandings of gentrification and our capacity to translate academic findings into more productive direction for communities and stakeholders, but with this sudden development comes a steep learning curve. The current paper aims to bridge this divide by providing an overview of recent progress and an actionable template of use that is accessible for researchers across a wide array of academic fields. As a secondary point of emphasis, the review goes over Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tools for gentrification models and opens up discussion on the nuanced challenges that arise when applying black-box models to human systems.","Maya, Mueller","Simi, Hoque","Pearsall, Hamil",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS,Gentrification,Machine learning,Built environment,Neighborhood change,Computer vision,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2024,Machine learning to model gentrification: A synthesis of emerging forms
Row_308,"Globally, co-production serves as a crucial approach to promote sustainable neighborhood rehabilitation. However, in China, where the governance system is characterized by strong state discourse power and a lack of public participation tradition, neighborhood rehabilitation encounters significant challenges, leading to project postponements or even failures due to unsuccessful co-production activities. To reveal the hidden problems, this paper aims to gain an in-depth understanding of the stakeholders' co-production roles and their participation structure in the co-produced sustainable neighborhood rehabilitation process from multiple dimensions. Using the case in Chongqing, the data was collected through questionnaire surveys and in-depth interviews. Social network analysis was utilized as the research method, and one-mode and two-mode networks were established to depict six relationship types with using diverse network indicators. This study revealed the high complexity of stakeholder structure, the awkward role of grass-rooted government, the dilemma of public voices and perceptions, uneven involvement in the co-production process, and the dynamic path of co-production formation. Drawing upon co-production theory, this paper elucidates the intricate mechanism of co-produced neighborhood rehabilitation in China. It offers valuable implications for policymakers and urban planners for project promotion, and contributes empirical insights to research in similar governance systems across the global context.","Wu, Hongjuan","Wang, Ying","Zhuang, Taozhi","Li, Kaijian","Hu, Wanping",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,CITIES,Co -production,Sustainable neighborhood rehabilitation,Social network analysis,Stakeholder structure,China,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2024,What makes co-production work in sustainable neighborhood rehabilitation in China?

Row_312,"Resident participation is essential for neighborhood rehabilitation. It requires the active involvement of residents and efficient management by organizers. To improve the effectiveness of resident participation, it is necessary to understand the critical success factors (CSFs) underlying it. However, previous research has examined the critical factors from a single-stakeholder perspective, overlooking potential differences in perceptions among stakeholders with diverse roles and rehabilitation experiences. Based on 30 interviews and 255 questionnaires from six stakeholder groups in Wuhan, China, this study explores how the perception of critical factors for effective resident participation varies among local government, community-based organization, designer, contractor, consulting party, and resident. Thirty-seven factors were identified and compared among the stakeholders. Financial Incentive (for participation organizers) was identified as the most critical factor for effective resident participation, followed by Information Disclosure and Transparency, and Trust. Results from the analysis of variance (ANOVA) show that the six groups differed significantly in the importance of most factors (25/37), especially in Participant Education and Prejudice against the Working Group. Interview results indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic and rehabilitation experience changed stakeholders' perceived importance of some factors. Specifically, in future RP initiatives, extra emphasis could be placed on Trait and Capacity (of the working group) and Participation-assistance Technologies. Stakeholders regarded these two factors as more critical as their rehabilitation experience accumulated. By understanding stakeholders' conflicting and changing perceptions of effective resident participation, suggestions were proposed to each stakeholder group to fulfill their distinct participation objectives and improve the overall effectiveness of participation practices.","Li, Yu","Tao, Yinhua","Qian, Queena K.","Mlecnik, Erwin","Visscher, Henk J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,Resident participation,Neighborhood rehabilitation,Critical success factor (CSF),Stakeholder perception,COVID-19 pandemic,China,,,,,,,,,APR 2024,"Critical factors for effective resident participation in neighborhood rehabilitation in Wuhan, China: From the perspectives of diverse stakeholders"
Row_314,"Agriculture impacts the ecological status of freshwaters through multiple pressures such as diffuse pollution, water abstraction, and hydromorphological alteration, strongly impairing riverine biodiversity. The agricultural effects, however, likely differ between agricultural types and practices. In Europe, agricultural types show distinct spatial patterns related to intensity, biophysical conditions, and socioeconomic history, which have been operationalised by various landscape typologies. Our study aimed at analysing whether incorporating agricultural intensity enhances the correlation between agricultural land use and the ecological status. For this, we aggregated the continent's agricultural activities into 20 Areas of Farming-induced Freshwater Pressures (AFFP), specifying individual pressure profiles regarding nutrient enrichment, pesticides, water abstraction, and agricultural land use in the riparian zone to establish an agricultural intensity index and related this intensity index to the river ecological status. Using the agricultural intensity index, nearly doubled the correlative strength between agriculture and the ecological status of rivers as compared to the share of agriculture in the subcatchment (based on the analysis of more than 50,000 sub-catchment units). Strongest agricultural pressures were found for high intensity cropland in the Mediterranean and Temperate regions, while extensive grassland, fallow farmland and livestock farming in the Northern and Highland regions, as well as low intensity mosaic farming, featured lowest pressures. The results provide advice for pan-European management of freshwater ecosystems and highlight the urgent need for more sustainable agriculture. Consequently, they can also be used as a basis for European Union-wide and global policies to halt biodiversity decline, such as the post -2027 renewal of the Common Agricultural Policy.","Schuerings, Christian","Globevnik, Lidija","Lemm, Jan U.","Psomas, Alexander","Snoj, Luka","Hering, Daniel","Birk, Sebastian",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8,,WATER RESEARCH,Cropland,Cumulative pressure index,Hydromorphology,Livestock,Nitrogen,Pesticides,Production intensity,Water abstraction,,,,,,,MAR 1 2024,River ecological status is shaped by agricultural land use intensity across Europe
Row_339,"Nearly 40 years after the first wave of Ethiopian immigration to Israel, the country's Ethiopian population still suffers from significant socioeconomic disadvantage: Many of its members live in highly homogeneous poor neighborhoods, which expose them to a variety of negative externalities. This study is the first to examine empirically the impact of Israel's policy of absorption and spatial distribution on the formation of homogeneous ghettos of Ethiopians, and the contribution of the government's major housing assistance programs for Ethiopians to solving or exacerbating this problem. The study, structured into four main stages, embraces a mixedmethods research approach drawing on diverse theoretical and methodological frameworks. In the first stage, we use descriptive statistics to introduce the current characteristics of the Ethiopian population in Israel and compare them with those of other marginalized social groups. In the second stage, we analyze the government's various housingassistance programs for the Ethiopian population, focusing on three flagship programs. The third stage analyzes the spatial outcomes of the primary housing-assistance program, which remains active to date. Lastly, through in-depth interviews with policymakers and Ethiopian leaders, we delve into the underlying considerations that lay behind the policy decisions made. The research findings indicate that Ethiopians experience social and economic disadvantages, yet their spatial situation seems to be better than that of other disadvantaged groups, because a significant part of this population apparently enjoys the advantages of living in the center of the country. The findings further show that while the various government housing-assistance programs have elevated homeownership rates among Ethiopians, they have not prevent the formation and proliferation of spatial concentrations of poverty. Nor have they ever provided both the means and the knowledge needed to enable Ethiopians households to enhance their quality of life by moving out of these neighborhoods. To truly address the problem of homogeneous concentrations of poverty, a holistic but tailor-made housing policy is essential. This policy should not simply mirroring the national housing policy, which focuses almost exclusively on homeownership, but rather incorporate diverse policy measures for different populations. A good and just housing policy must take into account the existing spatial dynamic and the core-periphery relations and ensure an environment that provides quality employment and education opportunities alongside social networks that the residents can leverage to increase their social, economic, and cultural capital. Otherwise, the government housing-assistance programs will continue to be mere lip service and too little, too late.","Yohalasht, Dana Shomuiy","Nachmany, Harel","Hananel, Ravit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,PROGRESS IN PLANNING,Housing policy,Absorption policy,Concentrated poverty,Ethiopians,Israel,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,"Immigrants, slums, and housing policy: The spatial dispersal of the Ethiopian population in Israel"
