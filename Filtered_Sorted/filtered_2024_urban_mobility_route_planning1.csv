Row_10,"As urbanization and economic growth advance, large-scale customers and real-time traffic conditions have become crucial factors in urban route planning. Deep reinforcement learning is considered the most effective method for solving urban route planning problems involving large-scale customers and real-time traffic conditions. Due to memory usage limitations, existing deep reinforcement learning methods cannot identify candidate customers or determine optimal travel routes in large-scale and real-time environments. To tackle these problems, this study introduces a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning method utilizing an improved transformer model (HDRLITF) based on the divide-and-conquer concept. Graph attention networks and gate mechanisms are integrated into the transformer model to capture dynamic features and improve the model's performance. A two-stage training method, based on the actor-critic algorithm, is proposed to determine the optimal policy function. To evaluate the HDRLITF method, experiments were conducted using datasets from the cities of Shenzhen and Chengdu in China. The experimental results suggest that the HDRLITF method can effectively interact with real-time traffic environments and obtain high-quality solutions compared to other deep reinforcement learning methods. The robustness and reliability of HDRLITF were further validated across multiple traffic scenarios and indicators.","Li, Yuanyuan","Guan, Qingfeng","Gu, Jun Feng","Jiang, Xintong","Li, Yang",,,,,,0,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE,Urban route planning,large-scale customers,real-time traffic,hierarchical deep reinforcement learning,transformer model,,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,A hierarchical deep reinforcement learning method for solving urban route planning problems under large-scale customers and real-time traffic conditions
Row_11,"The increasing availability of mobile Internet and portable devices has led to the popularity of spatial crowdsourcing recently. The significant burgeoning of ridesharing services in spatial crowdsourcing has transformed urban mobility. However, due to the imbalance between supply and demand, some requests may be rejected or workers may keep idle for a long time. Fortunately, sharing tasks and workers across multiple platforms in a collaborative manner can diminish the negative effects of non-uniform distribution. In this paper, we propose a M ulti-platform Route P lanning in ridesharing problem (MPRP), which integrates route planning and task assignment in spatial crowdsourcing. We study how to improve the total revenue of platforms through coordination with multiple ridesharing platforms. To solve the problem, we propose the Greedy Multi-platform Route Planning algorithm (G-MPRP), which extends the dynamic programming insertion operation and assigns workers in a greedy manner. To overcome the shortcoming of G-MPRP, we further propose the Pack-based Multi-platform Route Planning algorithm (P-MPRP), which packs requests through a ranking-based function. Extensive experimental results shows the proposed algorithms can improve the revenues significantly.","Jin, Qianqian","Li, Boyang","Cheng, Yurong","Zhao, Xiangguo",,,,,,,0,,EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS,Spatial databases,Crowdsourcing,Ridesharing,Task assignment,Route planning,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 1 2024,Real-time Multi-platform Route Planning in ridesharing
Row_12,"To address the growing challenges urban sprawl poses, it is essential to understand its influence on urban transportation, a primary source of economic, social, and environmental impact. This study fills this gap by quantifying the consequences of sprawl on transportation efficiency, proposing an interdisciplinary methodology that integrates knowledge from operations research. Specifically, adopting a broad European perspective, we investigate how urban sprawl correlates with travel distances and optimal routes in 156 spatially heterogeneous cities across 28 European countries. We discover a significant correlation between five sprawl indicators (Land usage, Gini coefficient, Shannon entropy, Moran I index, and Bribiesca index) and both travel distances and routes by car and bicycle: transportation is inherently less efficient in cities with higher levels of sprawl. Among the considered indicators, Shannon entropy emerges as the best predictor of route efficiency. We offer insights into the geography of sprawl in Europe, finding that many Spanish cities stand out for their compactness and route efficiency, while hotspots of sprawl are present in many Western and Central European countries. Our results underline the underestimated importance of addressing urban sprawl to reduce transportation's economic, social, and environmental costs and encourage policymakers and urban planners to prioritize compact city development to foster sustainable urban growth.","Rosati, Roberto Maria",,,,,,,,,,0,,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,Urban sprawl,Routing,Impacts of urban sprawl,Geography of urban sprawl,City logistics,Traveling salesman problem,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2025,Urban Sprawl and Routing: A Comparative Study on 156 European Cities
Row_17,"Urban greenways enhance the social, environmental, and ecological facets of city life by offering accessible and engaging spaces for residents. Despite their significance, the route selection for these urban greenways often hinges on suitability analysis, which can be influenced by a planner's subjective judgment, thus potentially introducing bias. Spatial optimization is a potential solution for determining optimal urban greenway routes. However, urban greenway route planning poses a distinct spatial optimization challenge that is not addressed by existing models. While urban greenways are inherently linear features, there are generally no specific start or end points dictated in their planning, which contrasts with many existing line-based spatial optimization models. Moreover, the way that coverage for urban greenways is measured-by taking into account the area encompassed within a particular distance from the entire urban greenway-deviates from the method used in conventional coverage optimization models, which works through discrete point-based evaluations. To address these gaps, our study introduces the maximal covering location problem for lines (MCLP-Line) model, which is designed to determine the optimal single-line-shaped urban greenway route with maximum coverage of nearby residents. In this paper, we utilize a line graph data structure to transform the candidate road network into a graph where road segments become nodes and junctions are treated as edges. We delineate the mixed integer linear programming formulation for the MCLP-Line model and discuss approaches for eliminating subtours in the MCLP-Line model in detail. The study provides simulation tests using both randomly generated data and an empirical dataset from Lhasa to demonstrate the practicality and computational efficiency of the proposed model.","Mu, Wangshu","Li, Changfeng",,,,,,,,,2,,COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS,Spatial optimization,Coverage,Line,Urban greenway,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2024,Optimization of urban greenway route using a coverage maximization model for lines
Row_27,"The urban logistics delivery planning problems are a crucial component of urban spatial decision analysis. Most studies typically focus on traditional urban logistics delivery planning problems and ignore real-time traffic information. With the advancement of urbanization, real-time traffic networks play a critical role. However, previous studies have utilized heuristic methods to solve urban logistics delivery planning with real-time traffic information problems, and few studies have applied deep reinforcement learning methods to tackle this problem. Deep reinforcement learning methods solving traditional logistics delivery planning problems overlook the impact of dynamic spatio-temporal features on route planning. In this study, we propose a new deep reinforcement method called DRLDSTG. The method introduces the dynamic spatio-temporal graph model into a deep reinforcement learning method to capture these dynamic features from urban logistics delivery planning tasks. The actor-critic with maximum entropy method is employed to train the model and determine the optimal policy function. The experimental results indicated that the proposed method can achieve a superior solution with faster computational efficiency compared to commercial software and heuristic methods. Compared to other deep reinforcement learning methods, our method can more effectively learn dynamic spatio-temporal features from environments, demonstrating promising applications in cities.","Li, Yuanyuan","Guan, Qingfeng","Gu, Junfeng","Jiang, Xintong",,,,,,,1,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH,Urban spatial decision analysis,urban logistics delivery planning problems,real-time traffic,deep reinforcement learning,graph model,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 9 2024,A deep reinforcement learning with dynamic spatio-temporal graph model for solving urban logistics delivery planning problems
Row_46,"Detours are inevitable in on-demand customized bus (CB) systems. Previous studies alleviate the impact of detours by predefining high-spatial-temporal similarity of travel orders for CB. However, this assumption is clearly inconsistent with orders' distribution at the urban level and leads to low-bus occupancy rate in practical use. In this article, we propose a novel service policy to achieve cost-effective CB, which consists of dynamically deployed bus stops and a spatial-temporal heterogeneous-order service. Then, to address the challenge of computational complexity, we provide an order-oriented graphic model named order correlation network (OCN) to formulate the CB design problem. By introducing OCN, we propose a near-optimal computationally efficient solution to the problem, which is scalable and suitable for real-time implementation. Finally, comparative experiments based on the real-world taxi trajectory data set in San Francisco are implemented to verify the performance of our proposed CB in terms of service coverage and travel efficiency.","Wang, Yueting","Hu, Zhiqun","Huang, Hao","Lu, Zhaoming","Wen, Xiangming",,,,,,0,,IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL,Heuristic algorithms,Costs,Internet of Things,Routing,Computational modeling,Urban areas,Schedules,Bus planning,customized bus (CB),CB system,demand-responsive transit,directed acyclic graph,,,,,,MAR 15 2024,"Optimization for Customized Bus Stop Planning, Order Schedule, and Routing Design in On-Demand Urban Mobility"
Row_50,"Sustainable urban road planning necessitates the formulation of functional, economic, people-friendly, ecofriendly, and engineering-reasonable road schemes within the confines of limited urban space. It is challenging to meet traffic demands, stimulate economic growth, foster social progress, and minimize adverse impacts on the social and natural environment. This study proposes a comprehensive approach for sustainable urban road planning, employing the Digital Twin-MCDM-GIS framework. Digital twins play a pivotal role in converting diverse factors into comprehensible expressions. MCDM (multi-criteria decision making) evaluates and assigns weights to these multidisciplinary factors. GIS (geographic information system) offers an integrated digital space for analysis. Various digitalisation and parsing methods, including direct assignment methods, spatial analysis methods, and complex professional methods, are introduced for traffic, development, cost, social, environmental, and engineering factors. By assigning distinct weights to these factors, diverse raster data are established to generate multiple road schemes using the least-cost wide path analysis. To validate the proposed approach, a case study was conducted in the London Borough of Bromley, resulting in the generation of 14 road schemes with varying widths and factor considerations in limited urban space.","Jiang, Feng","Li, Junda","Ma, Ling","Dong, Zejiao","Chen, Weiwei","Broyd, Tim","Wang, Guohao",,,,1,,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,Urban road planning,Sustainable development,Environmental protection,Built environment,Social development,Economy,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 1 2024,Sustainable urban road planning under the digital twin-MCDM-GIS framework considering multidisciplinary factors
Row_59,"Road traffic is the primary source of environmental noise pollution in cities. This problem is also spreading due to inadequate urban expansion planning. Hence, integrating road traffic noise analysis into urban planning is necessary for reducing city noise in an effective, adaptable, and sustainable way. This study aims to develop a methodology that applies to any city for the stratification of urban roads by their functionality through only their urban features. It is intended to be a tool to cluster similar streets and, consequently, traffic noise to enable urban and transportation planners to support the reduction of people's noise exposure. Three multivariate ordered logistic regression statistical models (Model 1, 2, and 3) are presented that significantly stratify urban roads into five, four, and three categories, respectively. The developed models exhibit a McFadden pseudo-R-2 between 0.5 and 0.6 (equivalent to R-2 >0.8). The choice between Model 1 or 2 depends on the scale of the city. Model 1 is recommended for developed cities with an extensive road network, while Model 2 is most suitable in intermediate and growing cities. On the other hand, Model 3 could be applied at any city scale but focused on local management of transit routes and for designing acoustic sensor installations, urban soundwalks, and identification of quiet areas. Urban features related to road width and length, presence of transport infrastructure, and public transport routes are associated with increased traffic noise in all three models. These models prove useful for future action plans aimed at reducing noise through strategic urban planning.","Montenegro, Alexandra L.","Rey-Gozalo, Guillermo","Arenas, Jorge P.","Suarez, Enrique",,,,,,,1,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,Road traffic noise,Urban sound environment,Sustainable urban planning,Multinomial ordered logistic regression,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 1 2024,Streets classification models by urban features for road traffic noise estimation
Row_74,"Unmanned Ariel Vehicle (UAV) services with 5G connectivity is an emerging field with numerous applications. Operator-controlled UAV flights and manual static flight configurations are major limitations for the wide adoption of scalability of UAV services. Several services depend on excellent UAV connectivity with a cellular network and maintaining it is challenging in predetermined flight paths. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework for UAV path planning with assured connectivity (DUPAC). During UAV flight, DUPAC determines the best route from a defined source to the destination in terms of distance and signal quality. The viability and performance of DUPAC are evaluated under simulated real-world urban scenarios using the Unity framework. The results confirm that DUPAC achieves an autonomous UAV flight path similar to base method with only 2% increment while maintaining an average 9% better connection quality throughout the flight.","Oh, Jiyong","Raza, Syed M.","Mwasinga, Lusungu J.","Kim, Moonseong","Choo, Hyunseung",,,,,,0,,IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL,UAV flight planning,signal quality,Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL),Unity framework,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024,Deep UAV Path Planning with Assured Connectivity in Dense Urban Setting
Row_90,"Although many cities are incentivizing non-auto modes of transportation in response to the climate crisis, their sustainable mobility transition efforts are being challenged by the rising intensity and frequency of heatwaves. Pedestrians are exposed to high levels of heat stress on hot days, which may reduce their willingness to walk. It is thus important to understand how heat affects pedestrian behavior and accessibility, so that climate mitigation strategies can be better targeted to support walking as a mode of transport but also as a first-/last-mile connection to public transit. In this study, we used a dataset of pedestrian trips undertaken during the summer of 2014 in Boston, MA. Along with several route attributes (such as length, turns, sidewalk width, amenities, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and Sky View Factor), we also included a measure of heat stress (Universal Thermal Climate Index - UTCI) to explain pedestrian route choice behavior. Using path-size logistic regression models, we found evidence to suggest that heat stress has a considerable and statistically significant effect on the perceived walking distance. We also found that the effect was non-uniform and possibly exponential. Additionally, we illustrated the extent to which heat stress can reduce pedestrian accessibility to important destinations (such as public transit). This reduction was significant on a typical summer day, with an even sharper reduction on the hottest summer day. Non-White residents were observed to have lower accessibility levels compared to all pedestrians, likely because of disparities in urban heat exposure. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating heat exposure into transportation planning and urban design frameworks, especially with an equity lens to address unequal consequences.","Basu, Rounaq","Colaninno, Nicola","Alhassan, Aziz","Sevtsuk, Andres",,,,,,,1,,CITIES,Heat stress,Thermal comfort,Willingness to walk,Pedestrian route choice,Accessibility,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,Hot and bothered: Exploring the effect of heat on pedestrian route choice behavior and accessibility
Row_94,"As urban redevelopment becomes an essential instrument for further urban development, the spatial outcomes of these redevelopment activities exert an increasingly profound impact on urban development. Unlike past statedominated urban redevelopment, current market-oriented redevelopment activities are becoming more active, while the government continues to play an important role through various forms of intervention. To optimise the development of urban space, a comprehensive understanding of the effect of government interventions on the spatial variations of market-oriented redevelopment activities is required. Against the background of Shenzhen's market-oriented urban village redevelopment, this study formulated a theoretical framework to identify the core government interventions in terms of urban planning, development intensity control, and decentralisation, and then analysed how they affect the market-oriented redevelopment activities from a spatial perspective. Ordinary least squares regression and geographically weighted regression models were employed to conduct an empirical analysis to measure the specific impact of diverse government interventions. The results show that the planned transport routes, public facilities, and density zones can effectively guide the urban village redevelopment projects towards the future core development areas of a city. The introduction and implementation of Shenzhen's decentralisation of urban redevelopment have promoted urban village redevelopment and have resulted in significant differences in redevelopment activities dominated by market forces across administrative districts. It provides practical implications for implementing proper government interventions for the sustainable spatial development of redevelopment activities.","Jiang, Lin","Lai, Yani","Guo, Renzhong","Li, Xiaoming","Hong, Wuyang","Tang, Xiao",,,,,17,,CITIES,Urban redevelopment,Urban village redevelopment,Government intervention,Spatial outcomes,Shenzhen,,,,,,,,,,,,,APR 2024,"Measuring the impact of government intervention on the spatial variation of market-oriented urban redevelopment activities in Shenzhen, China"
Row_115,"Attractive cycling routes can effectively promote active mobility, thus reducing the twin pressures of the population boom and the greenhouse effect. However, the existing approaches for cycling route recommendation primarily concentrate on identifying the most efficient routes while ignoring the urban spatial context, which is essential to meet the user's particular preferences. This article proposes a novel method for informed sampling and recommending cycling routes leveraging crowd-sourced trajectories with weighted-latent Dirichlet allocation (WLDA). Precisely, spatial context mapping, incorporating a weighting mechanism into LDA, latent topics mining, and cycling route recommendation based on informed sampling are introduced. We collected 1,016 cycling trajectories around Cologne, Germany, for experimental analysis. The experimental results show that the three latent topics within the trajectories, leisure, city, and green tours, are clearly presented in the line density analysis. The insightful recommendation for unfamiliar cyclists could also be actively sampled upon the WLDA model. These findings suggest that our approach could shift the route recommendation paradigm from GIS analysis to a semantic mining perspective, yielding highly interpretable results and offering novel research avenues for applying machine learning in route planning.","Li, Weilian","Haunert, Jan-Henrik","Forsch, Axel","Zhu, Jun","Zhu, Qing","Dehbi, Youness",,,,,0,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE,Cycling route recommendation,weighted-latent Dirichlet allocation,crowd-sourced trajectories,spatial context mapping,natural language processing,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 1 2024,Informed sampling and recommendation of cycling routes: leveraging crowd-sourced trajectories with weighted-latent Dirichlet allocation
Row_159,"Under international advocacy for a low -carbon and healthy lifestyle, ambient PM2.5 pollution poses a dilemma for urban residents who wish to engage in outdoor exercise and adopt active low -carbon commuting. In this study, an Urban Air Health Navigation System (UAHNS) was designed and proposed to assist users by recommending routes with the least PM2.5 exposure and dynamically issuing early risk warnings based on topologized digital maps, an application programming interface (API), an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model, and two-step spatial interpolation. A test of the UAHNS's functions and applications was carried out in Wuhan city. The results showed that, compared with trained random forest (RF), LightGBM, Adaboost models, etc., the XGBoost model performed better, with an R2 exceeding 0.90 and an RMSE of approximately 15.74 mu g/m3, based on data from national air and meteorological monitoring stations. Further, the two-step spatial interpolation model was adopted to dynamically generate pollution distribution at a spatial resolution of 300 m*300 m. Then, an exposure comparison was performed under randomly selected commuting routes and times in Wuhan, showing the recommended routes for lower PM2.5 exposure made effectively help. And the route difference ratios of about 14.9 % and 16.9 % for riding and walking, respectively. Finally, the UAHNS platform was integrally realized for Wuhan, consisting of a real-time PM2.5 query, a one -hour PM2.5 prediction function at any location, health navigation on city map, and a personalized health information query.","Jiang, Pei","Gao, Chang","Zhao, Junrui","Li, Fei","Ou, Changhong","Zhang, Tao","Huang, Sheng",,,,1,,ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL,PM2.5,Air Health,Dynamic Exposure Risk,Machine learning model,Route planning,,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 2024,An exploration of urban air health navigation system based on dynamic exposure risk forecast of ambient PM2.5
Row_212,"Currently, most of the world's economically developed and densely populated cities are built along coasts, and populations and industries tend to concentrate in coastal areas. However, with climate change, extreme weather events frequently occur in coastal areas. High-density urban spaces have changed the natural hydrological cycle, and the dense spatial layout, low-load municipal system planning, and inefficient management system of coastal cities have led to an increasing threat of flooding in these high-density urban areas, affecting their safety and sustainable development. In this context, the scientific and reasonable risk assessment of future flooding in coastal high-density urban areas has become an urgent problem and a key focus of urban disaster prevention and control efforts. In this paper, a flood identification tool is developed, a technical route for flood risk identification is established, identification scenarios under several disaster conditions are set, and classification criteria for flood risk identification are determined. An empirical study of high-density urban areas in Macau is carried out, the Infoworks Icm hydrological simulation software (Manufacturer: HR Wallingford (Shanghai) Co.,Ltd) is used to establish a flood hazard risk identification model for the Macau Peninsula, and flood hazard risk zones for the high-density urban areas in Macau are identified and delineated based on the simulation results.","Zhang, Rui","Li, Yangli","Chen, Tian","Zhou, Long",,,,,,,6,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION,High -density urban area,Flood,Risk identification,Disaster scenario simulation,Infoworks icm,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 1 2024,Flood risk identification in high-density urban areas of Macau based on disaster scenario simulation
Row_216,"The increasing prominence of natural disasters in recent years has made emergency disaster management one of the main challenges for building resilient societies. This way, the warming combination with human-induced urban interventions with climate change reshapes the strategic decision-making that public managers must deal with to promote safety and preparedness. Consequently, it implies complex situations under uncertainty that comprise conflicting dilemmas about which decision-makers (DMs) should establish trade-offs. Given this backdrop, this work proposes a risk-based multidimensional model for assessing urban shelter location against flood risk with Decision Analysis and Multi-Attribute Utility Theory. By using principles of the Queue Theory, the decision model undertakes four criteria that measure in a probabilistic manner the alternatives' performance when considering urban flood disaster evacuation routes in affected areas. Altogether, it enables the DM to establish his/her preferences with views to rank potential locations for mounting temporary shelters and for planning emergency preparedness in risky areas. Being replicable to any urban context, our proposal has the potential to support and promote the development and implementation of crisis protocols consisting of measures to reduce flood impacts and adapt critical areas to climate change. From a numerical application of the proposed model, the DM is encouraged to explore graphical and tabular visualization tools, as well as sensitivity analysis, to establish in strategic terms how to design and implement emergency shelters to reduce flood risks in urban areas effectively.","de Albuquerque, Nicolas Lennick Bomfim","da Silva, Lucas Borges Leal","Alencar, Marcelo Hazin","de Almeida, Adiel Teixeira",,,,,,,4,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION,Emergency preparedness,Urban flood,MAUT,Decision analysis,Multicriteria decision-making,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2024,A multicriteria decision model to improve emergency preparedness: Locating-allocating urban shelters against floods
Row_223,"The implementation of vehicle-to-grid technology enables bidirectional communication and power flow in the Internet of Electric Vehicles (IoEV) context, facilitating the extensive application of electric vehicles (EVs) in the logistics industry. In response to escalating urban traffic congestion, simultaneously, many cities have implemented widespread traffic restriction policies. Scientifically optimizing the charging strategies for electric logistics fleets and formulating rational distribution plans are pivotal pathways for developing more efficient and intelligent IoEV. To address the problem, an EV routing problem of heterogeneous fleet with time window under traffic constraints is formulated, featuring strategies for demand-driven charging within the IoEV and staggered traffic restriction periods. Given the intricate nature of this mathematical model, it is divided into two sub problems, from which two integer programming models are derived. To tackle this model, a two-tier optimization approach is employed, and an improved ant colony optimization algorithm integrated with variable neighborhood search is proposed. Experimental results show that the proposed model reduces the cost by 9.80%-15.68%, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed charging and staggered traffic restriction strategies, as well as the influence of different traffic restriction factors. This research holds practical and theoretical significance in aiding local governments in formulating rational traffic restriction policies, assisting businesses in effectively reducing the costs of electric logistics fleets, and advancing the development of IoEVs.","Wang, Heng","Chen, Sihao","Li, Menghan","Zhu, Caihua","Wang, Zhenfeng",,,,,,0,,IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL,Logistics,Electric vehicles,Routing,Costs,Mathematical models,Batteries,Vehicle-to-grid,Demand-driven charging,electric vehicle routing problem (EVRP),Internet of Electric Vehicles (IoEV),traffic restrictions,,,,,,,NOV 15 2024,Demand-Driven Charging Strategy-Based Distributed Routing Optimization Under Traffic Restrictions in Internet of Electric Vehicles
