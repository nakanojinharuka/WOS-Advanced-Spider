Row_305,"Modelling of groundwater flow and transport in urban environments is complicated by changes in recharge due to urbanization, and interactions between groundwater, water supply networks and sewerage pipe infrastructure. This study presents an applied groundwater modelling project that attempts to capture the complexity and quantify the uncertainty of groundwater flow and mass transport in urban environments using recently developed methods. A python scripting approach was used for model development and preparation of a calibration constrained parameter uncertainty analysis using the iterative ensemble smoother method (IES). Water supply and sewer infrastructure locations were explicitly included in the numerical model as boundary conditions with adjustable parameters during the calibration. The model calibration, and predictive uncertainty analysis considered more than 100,000 independent parameters, which were applied at zones, pilot points and directly on the model grid to define model properties, boundary conditions, and initial conditions. Calibration observations included both water level and concentration measurements at 18 boreholes over the 12-year operational life of a remediation system. The IES method was applied to calibrate 120 alternative and equally plausible parameter realizations. Initial parameter values were produced from initial statistical distributions defined by parameter bounds and based on the conceptual hydrogeological model, literature review and spatial correlations of hydraulic properties observed in well tests. The Amazon EC2 cloud computing service was used to provide the parallel computing capacity necessary to complete the project within a reasonable timeframe. Predictions of long-term mass transport towards a creek after the termination of active remediation were made with 47 of the resulting IES calibrated parameter sets. The IES method provided a distribution of potential impacts and allowed decisions about the future of the current remediation system to be made based on a quantitative, statistical, risk-based analysis. The extremely high degree of model parameterization allowed the complexity and uncertainty of an urban groundwater systems to be represented using adjustable model parameters, which reduced the likelihood of structural model error and biased predictions. This study found that fully python scripted model development and calibration setup, combined with IES, successfully allowed for improved representation of urban groundwater systems in numerical models. The post calibration groundwater flow budget of the model showed that groundwater interactions with sewer and water supply infrastructure are of similar magnitude to distributed recharge, and the omission of representing infrastructure in urban groundwater models could result in misleading predictions.","Hayley, Kevin","White, Emma",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Urban groundwater,Numerical Modelling,Uncertainty analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2024,Quantifying urban groundwater complexity: A high parameterization modelling approach

In this paper, we investigate the integration of real-world pet activities into immersive VR interaction. Our pilot study showed that the active pet movements, especially dogs, could negatively impact users' performance and experience in immersive VR. We proposed three different types of pet integration, namely semitransparent real-world portal, non-interactive object in VR, and interactive object in VR. We conducted the user study with 16 pet owners and their pets. The results showed that compared to the baseline condition without any pet-integration technique, the approach of integrating the pet as interactive objects in VR yielded significantly higher participant ratings in perceived realism, joy, multisensory engagement, and connection with their pets in VR.","Xiong, Ningchang","Liu, Qingqin","Zhu, Kening",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS,Virtual reality,Visualization,Virtual environments,Urban areas,Three-dimensional displays,Portals,Media,Virtual Reality,Haptics,Distractions,Presence,Pet,,,MAY 2024,PetPresence: Investigating the Integration of Real-World Pet Activities in Virtual Reality

However, the nonlinear and interaction relationships between multilevel (macroscale and microscale) BE and outdoor jogging are poorly explained. Therefore, this work established an explainable machine learning-based analytical framework that integrating Gradient Boosting Decision Tree and SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the nonlinear and interaction effects. Employing Beijing, China as the case, this study conducted an empirical analysis of multilevel BE factors affecting outdoor jogging utilizing multi -source big data, including large-scale jogging GPS trajectories and street view images. Results revealed that: (1) Macroscale BE including sports amenities and accessibility play an important role in affecting jogging. (2) All BE factors have nonlinear association with jogging, and the effective range and threshold effects vary by variables. Notably, several variables associated with jogging are in inverted U or V shapes. (3) The complex interaction effects including synergistic, weakened, among BE factors were scrutinized. BE factors regarding accessibility and sports amenity interact more easily. (4) Regions with similar local effects were clustered to understand the spatial varying of BE's influences and establish targeted interventions.

Row_317,"Background: Despite growing attention from researchers and governments, challenges persist in comprehensively assessing urban sound quality by integrating both quietness and naturalness aspects. Goals: This study aimed to develop an innovative soundscape quality index that concurrently evaluates quietness and naturalness in urban soundscapes. Our objectives included conducting urban soundscape quality mapping, analyzing influential mechanisms, and identifying priority zones for sound environment management. Approaches: We collected sound pressure level (SPL) and raw audio data, from which we computed a normalized difference soundscape index (NDSI). With a dataset comprising 28 explanatory variables encompassing land use, built environment, vegetation characteristics, and temporal factors, we employed the random forest (RF) model to predict 10 indicators, including eight SPL-related indices, NDSI, and the QNS (quietness and naturalness soundscape) index. Crucially, we utilized SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to interpret the RF model. Findings: Spatial variations in quietness and naturalness were evident, closely associated with road networks and vegetation, respectively, with discernible temporal variations. The top three variables influencing QNS were distance to major roads, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and proportion of tree coverage. Moreover, interaction effects highlighted dual negative or synergistic promoting effects on QNS from factors such as road width, human disturbance, vegetation configurations, and land cover. Notably, these mechanisms were successfully applied to six typical tourist attractions in Xiamen city, where five types of management zones were mapped based on priority considerations of population density and soundscape quality. Interestingly, natural soundscape reserves were highly correlated with city parks, high-risk zones predominantly overlapped with road networks, and potential zones comprised inner communities between streets. Significance: The framework demonstrated effectiveness in mapping, exploring mechanisms, and guiding management strategies for the urban sound environment.","Wang, Jingyi","Wang, Zhen","Li, Chunming","Yao, Ziyan","Cui, Shenghui","Huang, Quanjia","Liu, Yin","Wang, Tingting",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL,Sound environment quality,Urban sound environment prediction,Sound map,Sound environment management,Random forest,Public health,,,,,,,,,MAY 2024,"An exploratory framework for mapping, mechanism, and management of urban soundscape quality: From quietness to naturalness"
Row_319,"Investigating the spatiotemporal characteristics of residents' intercity travel affected by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is of great significance to understanding and extending the impact of major public health affairs on intercity travelers, urban management policies, and intercity cooperative interactions. Taking 366 cities in China as an example, this study proposed a novel research framework for analyzing the spatiotemporal characteristics of intercity population flows. Using AutoNavi population migration big data sets from web crawling, the spatiotemporal structure patterns of intercity travel in China from January 1st to June 30th, 2020 were extracted by using the singular value decomposition (SVD) method. Then the spatial organization patterns of intercity travel networks in China and its five major urban agglomerations were identified by the weighted stochastic block model (WSBM). The results showed that the total volume of intercity travel in China and its five major urban agglomerations experienced a process of rapid decline followed by a slow recovery, presenting a ""Vshaped"" distribution since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Three distinctive intercity travel patterns, namely the stable, holiday, and weekday-weekend intercity trip patterns, were extracted from the spatiotemporal OD matrix of intercity travel. Strong intercity travels were mainly distributed in eastern and central China, forming an intercity travel pattern in which core cities pushed and pulled each other within the national urban agglomerations. However, intercity migration flows were dominated by weak-intensity flows. Intercity trips during the holidays had a phenomenon of ""escaping from the metropolis"". Meanwhile, it had significant spatial proximity and directionality. The daily intercity trips were characterized by a remarkable periodicity with seven days as a repeat. A more interesting finding is that when weekends overlap with holidays, intercity travel on the 1-2 days before the vacations has presented an effect of ""suppression travel"". Furthermore, at the national scale, the stable intercity travel network has formed a polycentric core-periphery structure of ""Three Cores-Six Semiperipheries-Five Peripheries"". At the urban agglomeration scale, they formed respectively distinguished monocentric, bicentric, and polycentric core-periphery structures.","Wei, Shimei","Pan, Jinghu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,CITIES,Intercity travel,Spatiotemporal pattern,Singular value decomposition (SVD),Weighted stochastic block model (WSBM),COVID-19,AutoNavi migration index (AMI),China,,,,,,,,SEP 2024,Spatiotemporal characteristics of residents' intercity travel in China under the impact of COVID-19 pandemic
Row_320,"Regional integration, a global trend covering multiple aspects of cities that constitute an urban agglomeration, is poised to reallocate limited resources and reshape regional production pattern. While its effects on urban economic efficiency and environmental emissions have been investigated, the agricultural system, which plays a pivotal role in ensuring food security, remains an underexplored domain. To address this, this study commences by discussing the possible influence of regional integration on agricultural production drawing from literature and practical evidence. Then the regional integration level of the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration (YRDUA) from 2005 to 2019 was evaluated, which is a facet that has received limited quantitative scrutiny hitherto. Subsequently, the agricultural production efficiency (APE) that integrates the composite inputs and outputs information was analyzed to assess the utility of rural production. The interconnection between these two systems was then explored by panel Tobit Model. The findings reveal that (1) regional integration in the YRDUA has exhibited fluctuation across different developmental stages and is presently converging toward a state of stability. (2) The APE appears better performance characterized by weakened spatial heterogeneity and long-term growth. (3) The APE presents an increase in response to the improved integration levels within the gradients, and the model results suggest a positive relationship between them. The discovery of this study implied the potential of macro-regulation promoted through regional integration to enhance APE, underscoring its dual welfares, impacting not only urban development but also extending its spilled-beneficial effects to rural overall production. It provides insights to help find solutions to food security and regional equilibrium under the worldwide tendency of regional integration.","Su, Dan","Cao, Yu","Fang, Xiaoqian","Wang, Jiayi","Cao, Yu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,Agricultural production efficiency,Regional integration,Food security,Regional heterogeneity,Yangtze river delta urban agglomeration,,,,,,,,,,JUL 20 2024,"Regional integration, agricultural production, and their heterogeneous interaction in the classic urban agglomeration of China"
Row_324,"Microplastics in freshwater ecosystems have gained attention for their potential impact on biodiversity. Rivers are complex and dynamic ecosystems that transport particles and organic matter from the headwaters through watersheds to the ocean. Changes in land use and the presence of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) increase the risk of plastic contamination. Simultaneously, hydromorphological features of the watershed can influence the dispersion and retention of microplastics. This study assesses the impact of urban land uses and river hydromorphology on microplastic abundance and spatial distribution in two watersheds with contrasting land uses. Unexpectedly, our findings show that microplastics were widespread throughout watersheds both in water (3.5 +/- 3.3 particles/L) and sediments (56.9 +/- 39.9 particles/g). The concentration of microplastics in sediments significantly increased in granulometry ranging from 0.5 to 1 mm. Microplastics in running waters are significantly correlated with increasing urban land use coverage. However, the presence and distance of WWTPs did not affect microplastic distribution. In conclusion, contrasting patterns were observed for suspended and sedimented microplastic particles: suspended microplastics were associated with an anthropogenic effect, whereas the concentration of microplastics in sediments was determined by riverbed granulometry. Our results suggest that the interaction of anthropogenic and environmental factors shapes microplastic distribution along the rivers and their subsequent transport toward the coastal ocean. Finally, a review of the current literature reveals the absence of standardization in field and laboratory assessment techniques and measurement units, representing a challenge for intercomparisons of river microplastic studies.","Gonzalez-Saldias, Fernanda","Sabater, Francesc","Goma, Joan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,Microplastic size,Urban land use,Hydrographic,Water treatment plants,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 10 2024,Microplastic distribution and their abundance along rivers are determined by land uses and sediment granulometry
Row_330,"The frequency and magnitude of extreme events, such as heat waves, are predicted to increase with climate change. However, assessments of the response of biological communities to heat waves are often inconclusive. We aimed to assess the responses in abundance, taxonomic and functional diversity indices of stream invertebrate communities to heat waves using long-term monitoring data collected across Europe. We quantified the heat waves' magnitude, analyzed the spatial (i.e., long-term mean) and temporal (anomaly around the long-term mean) components of variation in the magnitude of heat waves, and their interaction with anthropogenic stressors (ecological quality and land cover). For the spatial component of variation, we found a negative association of the community indices to the increasing magnitude of heat waves. Sites undergoing heat waves of higher magnitude showed fewer species and lower trait diversity compared with sites experiencing lower magnitude heat waves. However, we could not detect an immediate temporal response of the communities to heat waves (i.e., the temporal component). Furthermore, we found that the effects of heat waves interacted with the ecological quality of the streams and their surrounding land cover. Diversity declined with increasing heat waves' magnitude in streams with higher ecological quality or surrounded by forest, which may be due to a higher proportion of sensitive species in the community. Heat waves' impacts on diversity were also exacerbated by increasing urban cover. The interaction between heat waves' magnitude and anthropogenic stressors suggests that the effects of extreme events can compromise the recovery of communities. Further, the predicted increase in heat waves will likely have long-term effects on stream invertebrate communities that are currently undetected.","Cortes-Guzman, Daniela","Bowler, Diana E.","Haase, Peter",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,Invertebrates,Functional diversity,Heat waves,Spatio-temporal analysis,Taxonomic diversity,,,,,,,,,,NOV 25 2024,Spatial and temporal effects of heat waves on the diversity of European stream invertebrate communities

BC has resulted in an average of 6 % reduction in corporate carbon emissions, and the BC-ER policy interaction has encouraged firms to further reduce their emissions. This policy mix mainly exerts an abatement effect on firms by increasing green factors at the input-output stage and improving production efficiency. Furthermore, the digitalization effect of BC reduces corporate carbon emissions. Our empirical results are stronger for firms with high financial constraints, nonheavily polluting firms, non-high-technology firms, state-owned enterprises, and developed urban agglomerations. Furthermore, BC significantly suppresses the sectoral and spatial spillover effects of corporate carbon emissions, and external shocks to ER exacerbate this suppression effect.

Row_344,"On July 21, 2012, a catastrophic precipitation event occurred in Beijing, highlighting the serious threat of extreme precipitation on socioeconomic development and human health under climate change. Nevertheless, whether, how and to what extent aerosols and urbanization, as the two main influencing factors of urban extreme precipitation, have affected this highly damaging extreme event remains largely unexplored. Here, we employed the weather research and forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) and a single-layer urban canopy model to investigate the influences of urbanization, aerosols and their interactions on this extreme precipitation event. We found that the joint intensification effects of urbanization and aerosols on extreme precipitation events greatly enhance its negative influence on megacities. The results indicate that aerosols are enhanced by increasing cloud droplet numbers, thereby intensifying the feedback between precipitation and latent heating. Consequently, the total precipitation increased by 22.6%, raising the precipitation in the Beijing area increase by at least 50 mm. By stimulating atmospheric instability and strengthening vertical air motion (over 0.25 m s(-1)), the urban heat island effect considerably influences the temporal and spatial distributions of extreme precipitation events, resulting in an increase in warm cloud precipitation (80%) and a decrease (30%) in frontal precipitation. Consequently, joint intensification effects resulted in more concentrated precipitation in the southwest of Beijing, leading to a substantial increase (more than 40%, similar to 80 mm). This condition may be an important reason for the most severe disasters in the southwest of Beijing.","Feng, Tai-Chen","Yuan, Tian-Gang","Hu, Zhi-Yuan","Xie, Tie-Jun","Lai, Shen","Dong, Wen-Jie","Huang, Jian-Ping",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH,WRF-Chem,Extreme precipitation,North China,Aerosols,Urbanization,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,"Combined impacts of aerosols and urbanization on a highly threatened extreme precipitation event in Beijing, China"

The complex relationship between meteorological parameters and pollutants was explored using Pearson correlation analysis and interaction effect analysis. Using the correlation analysis and interaction analysis methods, four mechanical learning models, PCC-Is-CNN, PCC-Is-LSTM, PCC-Is-CNN-LSTM and PCC-Is-BP neural network, were developed for predicting PM2.5 concentration in different time scales by combining the long-term and short-term data with the basic mechanical learning models. The results show that the PCC-Is-CNN-LSTM model has superior prediction performance, especially when integrating short-term and long-term historical data. Meanwhile, applying the model to cities in other climatic zones, the results show that the model performs well in the Dwa climatic zone, while the prediction performance is lower in the CWa climatic zone. This suggests that although the model is well adapted in regions with a similar climate to Harbin, model performance may be limited in areas with complex climatic conditions and diverse pollutant sources. This study emphasizes the importance of considering meteorological and pollutant interactions to improve the accuracy of PM2.5 predictions, providing valuable insights into air quality management in cold regions.","Han, Dongliang","Shi, Luyang","Wang, Mingqi","Zhang, Tiantian","Zhang, Xuedan","Li, Baochang","Li, Jing","Tan, Yufei",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,MET parameters,Interaction effect,Deep learning,Prediction,PM2.5,,,,,,,,,,DEC 1 2024,"Variation pattern, influential factors, and prediction models of PM2.5 concentrations in typical urban functional zones of northeast China"

This study investigated the viability of an optical scatter monitor system, featuring two nephelometric monitors (pDR-1500), to determine kappa(OA) after knowing the aerosol chemical composition. This system was operated during a mobile lab deployment on Long Island in the summer of 2023, which was executed to coordinate with the Atmospheric Emissions and Reactions Observed from Megacities to Marine Areas (AEROMMA) field campaign. The derived kappa(OA) under subsaturated high-humidity conditions (RH between 85 % and 95 %) were categorized based on different aerosol sources, including wildfire aerosol, urban aerosol, and aerosol from rural conditions. The kappa(OA )and the OA O:C ratio exhibited linear positive relationships for the urban aerosol and the aerosol from rural conditions, with a much higher slope (0.50 vs. 0.24) for the latter. However, there was no clear relationship between kappa(OA) and the OA O:C ratio observed during each period affected by wildfire plumes.

Row_381,"Rapid urbanization has precipitated significant anthropogenic pollution (nutrients and pathogens) in urban rivers and their receiving systems, which consequentially disrupted the compositions and assembly of bacterial community within these ecosystems. However, there remains scarce information regarding the composition and assembly of both planktonic and benthic bacterial communities as well as pathogen distribution in such environments. In this study, full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing was conducted to investigate the bacterial community composition, interactions, and assembly processes as well as the distribution of potential pathogens along a riverine-coastal continuum in Shenzhen megacity, China. The results indicated that both riverine and coastal bacterial communities were predominantly composed of Gammaproteobacteria (24.8 +/- 12.6 %), Alphaproteobacteria (16.1 +/- 9.8 %), and Bacteroidota (14.3 +/- 8.6 %), while sedimentary bacterial communities exhibited significantly higher diversity compared to their planktonic counterparts. Bacterial community patterns exhibited significant divergences across different habitats, and a significant distance -decay relationship of bacterial community similarity was particularly observed within the urban river ecosystem. Moreover, the urban river ecosystem displayed a more complex bacterial co -occurrence network than the coastal ecosystem, and a low ratio of negative:positive cohesion suggested the inherent instability of these networks. Homogeneous selection and dispersal limitation emerged as the predominant influences on planktonic and sedimentary bacterial communities, respectively. Pathogenic genera such as Vibrio , Bacteroides , and Acinetobacter , known for their roles in foodborne diseases or wound infection, were also identified.

Row_384,"Understanding urban vertical structures, particularly building heights, is essential for examining the intricate interaction between humans and their environment. Such datasets are indispensable for a variety of applications, including climate modeling, energy consumption analysis, and socioeconomic activities. Despite the importance of this information, previous studies have primarily focused on estimating building heights regionally at the grid scale, often resulting in datasets with limited coverage or spatial resolution. This limitation hampers comprehensive global analysis and the ability to generate actionable insights at finer scales. In this study, we developed a global building height map at the building footprint scale by leveraging Earth Observation (EO) datasets and advanced machine learning techniques. Our approach integrated multisource remote-sensing features and building morphology features to develop height estimation models using the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) regression method across diverse global regions. This methodology allowed us to estimate the heights of individual buildings worldwide, culminating in the creation of the three-dimensional (3D) Global Building Footprints (3D-GloBFP) dataset for the year 2020. Our evaluation results show that the height estimation models perform exceptionally well at a global scale, with R-2 values ranging from 0.66 to 0.96 and root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) ranging from 1.9 to 14.6 m across 33 subregions. Comparisons with other datasets demonstrate that 3D-GloBFP closely matches the distribution and spatial pattern of reference heights. Our derived 3D global building footprint map shows a distinct spatial pattern of building heights across regions, countries, and cities, with building heights gradually decreasing from the city center to the surrounding rural areas. Furthermore, our findings indicate disparities in built-up infrastructure (i.e., building volume) across different countries and cities. China is the country with the most intensive total built-up infrastructure (5.28x10(11) m(3), accounting for 23.9 % of the global total), followed by the USA (3.90x10(11) m(3), accounting for 17.6 % of the global total). Shanghai has the largest volume of built-up infrastructure (2.1x10(10) m(3)) of all representative cities.

However, a comprehensive understanding of supply -demand mismatches in NbR is challenging due to the complex interaction among various social, economic and ecological factors. This paper investigates mismatches in NbR supply and demand to provide insights for informing spatial and regional planning to achieve sustainable tourism. To this end, the paper uses a wide range of indicators such as biophysical attributes, accessibility and social indicators to map and assess NbR supply and demand, followed by the application of spatial statistics to analyse supplydemand mismatches. Cluster analysis was performed based on the supply -demand relationship to identify a typology of NbR ES across the study area in the north of Iran. The paper proposes an innovative application of recreation ES bundles with potential implications for sustainable tourism in a region marked as a hot spot for tourism. The analysis generated a typology of five bundles of NbR ES with differing recreational opportunities. Bundles 1 and 2, characterized by a supply surplus and substantial ecological value, are suitable for NbR activities such as camping, hiking, climbing, and birdwatching. In contrast, bundle 4 and 5 associated with urban centres, experience a supply deficit, making them less suitable for NbR. Bundle 3, characterized by a mixture of natural and productive lands, plays an important role in maintaining a balanced supply -demand state. This region holds potential for diverse forms of tourism, including rural and agricultural recreation such as farm tours and farm life experiences.

Row_390,"Utilizing the framework of environmental health risk assessment and healing, the article reviews the effectiveness and potential of green space systems in mitigating the impact of high temperatures, promoting mental health, and improving the risk characteristics of high-temperature heat waves. We utilized CiteSpace software to conduct a time-zone analysis of the relationship between heatwaves, green spaces, and health using clustered data from 2001 to 2023. This study evaluates the role of green space systems in mitigating high temperatures and enhancing mental health within the environmental health risk assessment framework. Using CiteSpace software, we analyzed literature from 2001 to 2023, focusing on the interactions among heatwaves, green spaces, and health. Our results indicate that most existing research concentrates on hazard identification, with insufficient exploration of the dose-response relationships between green spaces and temperature reduction. Quantitative studies on green space design and spatial optimization are scarce, and guidance on effective configurations remains limited. Additionally, the health impacts of heatwaves vary by region, with a noticeable imbalance in research focus; Asia and Africa, in particular, are underrepresented in studies addressing heatwave effects. We conclude that effective mitigation strategies require: (1) a comprehensive environmental health risk assessment framework that integrates advanced methods like big data analysis and geospatial simulations to improve green space planning and design; (2) further theoretical exploration into the mechanisms by which green spaces regulate temperature and mental health, including detailed analysis of spatiotemporal patterns and the functional optimization of green space structures; and (3) the development of robust parameterized design guidance based on specific therapeutic dosages (green space stimulus) to optimize configurations and enhance the effectiveness of green spaces in mitigating adverse mental health impacts from deteriorating thermal environments.

We used the number of takeaway orders (copies/person) and the per capita takeaway consumption amount (RMB/person) in major Chinese cities in 2019 to characterize takeaway consumption in China. We investigated the driving mechanisms and factors affecting takeaway consumption amounts per capita and order per capita in China. The results show that takeaway consumption amounts per capita and order per capita is higher in East China than in North and Central China. The tertiary industry population ratio is crucial to takeaway consumption amounts per capita and order per capita in major Chinese cities. Amounts and orders increase as the tertiary industry population ratio rises. Factors affecting takeaway consumption amounts per capita and order per capita in Chinese cities of different population sizes vary. The working-age population ratio heavily influences the takeaway consumption amounts per capita and orders per capita in megacities. Additionally, internet penetration and average annual temperature play a significant role in takeaway consumption amounts per capita and orders per capita in megalopolis. In big cities I, the road capacity per capita and GDP per capita are the main factors affecting takeaway consumption amounts per capita and orders per capita. The tertiary industry population ratio is the core factor that determines takeaway consumption amounts per capita and orders per capita in big cities II. The interaction between natural and socio-economic factors dramatically increases the impact of takeaway consumption amounts per capita and order per capita in Chinese cities. In conclusion, this study provides a macro-level insight into the spatial characteristics and development factors of takeaway consumption in major Chinese cities. This knowledge is crucial for promoting the takeaway economy's sustainable development and realizing the takeaway industry's green transformation.","Zhang, Yin","Cui, Shenghui","Zhong, Yiqiang","Huang, Wei",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,Takeaway,Urban,Spatial heterogeneity,Multiple linear regression,Influencing factors,Geodetector,,,,,,,,,AUG 1 2024,Spatial patterns and influencing factors of takeaway consumption in 56 cities in China
Row_393,"Natural hazards could have devastating consequences globally, making hazard assessment and spatial prediction crucial for enhancing the resilience of urbanized regions. However, current disaster prediction and assessment research often neglect the compound effects between multiple geohazards highly in urbanized regions. To address the concern, we employed comparative methodology, evaluating four machine learning algorithms-Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), Back Propagation Neural Network (BP), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-in the creation of Geohazard Susceptibility Maps (GSM) for the highly urbanized Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Additionally, the study investigated the triggering mechanisms and the compound interaction between multiple geohazards using the conditional vine copula model. The results showed that the XGBoost model outperformed other models (AUC = 0.89) for predicting multiple geohazards. Geohazards were predominantly concentrated in urban areas in the GBA, with surface subsidence being the most severe, followed by collapse and landslide. The primary triggers for multigeohazards include distance to roads, slope length, and lithology, with slope length and lithology identified as the primary causative factors in urban areas. Urbanization within the GBA increased the probability of multigeohazards by 10%, compared to their univariate counterparts. Urban regions exhibited increased risks of landslides, surface subsidence, and collapse by approximately 31%, 44%, and 32%, respectively compared to non-urban regions. Additionally, compound geohazards in the GBA were primarily triggered by heavy rainfall, resulting in the formation of landslide-collapse and collapse-landslide geohazard chains. The probability of compound geohazards is approximately 5% lower than that of univariate geohazards. This is because compound geohazards necessitate a higher cumulative rainfall, and the rainfall threshold was approximately 2-3 times higher than that of univariate geohazards. In the cascading hazard pattern, the occurrence of primary geohazards during local heavy rain increased the probability of secondary geohazards by approximately 10%. The study provides essential insights for mitigating compound geohazards in urbanized areas.","He, Kunlong","Chen, Xiaohong","Yu, Xuan","Dong, Chunyu","Zhao, Dongmei",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,Geohazard susceptibility map,XGBoost,Vine coupla,Compound geohazard,Urbanization,,,,,,,,,,APR 10 2024,Evaluation and prediction of compound geohazards in highly urbanized regions across China's Greater Bay Area

Utilizing the ""ProductionLiving-Ecological"" spatial theory within territorial planning, this study devises a comprehensive evaluation system for human settlement quality. It delineates the evolution of human settlement quality across 47 counties (districts) in Jilin Province from 1999 to 2020, elucidates the interplay among the three aforementioned dimensions, and identifies the prevailing modes of human settlement transformation. Key findings include: (1) Jilin Province has seen significant enhancements in human settlement quality. Notable shifts in this quality occurred in 2006 and 2015. The synergy and reciprocal influences among the production, living, and ecological dimensions have intensified, with coordination continually advancing. (2) Human settlement quality varies with higher levels in the east and south and lower levels in the west and north in Jilin Province, indicating a spatial clustering pattern. Living and ecological conditions are generally better in the east compared to the west, with noticeable economic-environmental mutual constraints in the west. (3) Given a certain socio-economic development threshold, the trajectory of human settlement quality sketches an overarching ""S""-shaped growth pattern. This can be categorized into the first phase of fluctuation, followed by the second phase of significant growth and the third phase of slowing growth.

Row_401,"The global urbanization process requires solving the issues of rural and poverty, and research on the coupling patterns and correlational effects of rurality and regional poverty governance change can provide references for promoting regional urban -rural integration and rural revitalization. Based on the analysis of the conceptual relationship and interaction mechanism between rurality and poverty, this paper revealed the spatio-temporal pattern evolution characteristics and correlational effects of the rurality index (RI) and poverty governance level (PGL) in 91 counties of the rocky desertification area of Yunnan -Guangxi -Guizhou (RDAYGG) in China from 2005 to 2020 by using the multi -index comprehensive evaluation, Person correlation coefficient, and fixed effects model. The results showed that (1) there are similarities and differences between rurality and poverty. The logic of rurality affecting poverty governance is that the dynamic trade-offs between the share of positive and negative rurality in a region will come to alter the local capacity for urban -rural coordinated development, and the ideal process is manifested in the weakening of negative rurality and the enhancement of positive rurality. (2) From 2005 to 2020, the RI of counties within the RDAYGG showed a pattern of continuous weakening, while the PGL showed a trend of gradual increase in the whole region, and both were holistically characterized by reverse dynamic change. (3) The regional PGL is closely related to the change of rurality. When other influencing factors remain unchanged, for every 10% reduction in the RI, the PGL will increase by about 0.4%.

Specifically, we analyze the future dynamics under scenarios with different leading groups and development goals, and identify the main spatiotemporal patterns of expansion. Our results indicate that animal and seaweed mariculture would expand annually by 15.9-66.5 % and 0.1-2.6 %, respectively. Inertial-development and household-dominated scenarios favor animal production, whereas restricted-development and government-dominated scenarios promote seaweed farming.

Row_425,"As urbanisation increases, wildlife is more likely to be exposed to humans. Although human disturbance is the main cause of biodiversity loss, some wildlife thrives in anthropogenic environments. Such species show increased behavioural tolerance to humans, which plays an important role in human-wildlife coexistence. However, whether wildlife modulates tolerance differently between regions and cities is inadequately understood. Understanding how animals behaviourally modulate their tolerance to humans at the larger geographical scale can provide useful information to predict behavioural adaptations to urbanisation and adequate management actions for conservation. We examined alert distance (AD), flight initiation distance (FID), and vertical escape distance (VED) in Eurasian red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) in four countries (Finland, Germany, Japan, and the UK). Linear mixed models with Tukey's multicomparisons showed that all tolerance measures varied between countries. We subsequently analysed the relationship between site-scale environmental variables (vegetation conditions, presence of artificial feeding, and human population density) and tolerance behaviours separately by country. We found that squirrels were more tolerant in sites with taller trees and more underbrush cover in the UK, and more tolerant in sites with artificial feeding in Japan, while environmental variables were not associated with squirrels' tolerance in Finland and Germany. Our results indicated that regional forms of environmental factors and human-squirrel interactions play a key role in tolerance modification at the larger spatial scale. Our study suggests the importance of considering regional-dependent relationships between tolerance behaviours and environmental characteristics for urban wildlife conservation and management.","Uchida, Kenta","Hamill, Kathryn","Wist, Bianca","Cripps, Rachel","Kaisanlahti-Jokimaki, Marja-Liisa","Kampmann, Marc-Andre","Lindtner, Maira-Lee","Jokimaki, Jukka",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,Antipredator behaviour,Habituation,Flight initiation distance,Mammal,Urbanisation,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2025,Regional-dependent tolerance to humans: A multi-country comparison of horizontal and vertical escape distance in arboreal squirrels

However, traditional landscape ecological risk (LER) assessments consider the potential loss of ES supply while ignoring the supply-demand coupling relationship, and fails to reveal the actual situation of ecological risk. To fill this gap, taking the Southwest China (SWC) as an example, this study proposed an improved LER assessment method that focuses on ES supply-demand balance, and analyzed the spatio-temporal characteristics of LER and its driving factors in the SWC from 2000 to 2020 by using hotspot analysis, geo-detectors and geographical temporally weighted regression models. The results show that (1) the comparison results with the traditional LER evaluation method demonstrated the improved method's superior rationality and reliability. The overall LER of the SWC over the past 20 years displayed a fluctuating trend, with a spatial clustering pattern of high in the northeast and low in the southwest. (2) Human activities explained the relatively high spatial heterogeneity in high-risk areas, while in low-risk areas it was mainly the interaction of natural factors and landscape structural. Meanwhile, obvious temporal non-stationary was identified in the evolution of the key factors.

Row_445,"Land use regression (LUR) models are widely used in epidemiological and environmental studies to estimate humans' exposure to air pollution within urban areas. However, the early models, developed using linear regressions and data from fixed monitoring stations and passive sampling, were primarily designed to model traditional and criteria air pollutants and had limitations in capturing high-resolution spatiotemporal variations of air pollution. Over the past decade, there has been a notable development of multi-source observations from low-cost monitors, mobile monitoring, and satellites, in conjunction with the integration of advanced statistical methods and spatially and temporally dynamic predictors, which have facilitated significant expansion and advancement of LUR approaches. This paper reviews and synthesizes the recent advances in LUR approaches from the perspectives of the changes in air quality data acquisition, novel predictor variables, advances in modeldeveloping approaches, improvements in validation methods, model transferability, and modeling software as reported in 155 LUR studies published between 2011 and 2023. We demonstrate that these developments have enabled LUR models to be developed for larger study areas and encompass a wider range of criteria and unregulated air pollutants. LUR models in the conventional spatial structure have been complemented by more complex spatiotemporal structures. Compared with linear models, advanced statistical methods yield better predictions when handling data with complex relationships and interactions. Finally, this study explores new developments, identifies potential pathways for further breakthroughs in LUR methodologies, and proposes future research directions. In this context, LUR approaches have the potential to make a significant contribution to future efforts to model the patterns of long- and short-term exposure of urban populations to air pollution.","Ma, Xuying","Zou, Bin","Deng, Jun","Gao, Jay","Longley, Ian","Xiao, Shun","Guo, Bin","Wu, Yarui","Xu, Tingting","Xu, Xin","Yang, Xiaosha","Wang, Xiaoqi","Tan, Zelei","Wang, Yifan","Morawska, Lidia","Salmond, Jennifer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,22,,ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL,Air pollution,Land use regression,Multi -source observations,Spatiotemporal modeling,Linear regression,Advanced statistical methods,,,,,,,,,JAN 2024,A comprehensive review of the development of land use regression approaches for modeling spatiotemporal variations of ambient air pollution: A perspective from 2011 to 2023
Row_450,"Designing city-scale Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI) for flood risk management requires detailed and robust methods. This is due to the complex interaction of flow pathways and the need to assess cost-benefit trade-offs for various BGI options. This study aims to find a cost-effective BGI placement scheme by developing an improved approach called the Cost OptimisatioN Framework for Implementing blue-Green infrastructURE (CONFIGURE). The optimisation framework integrates a detailed hydrodynamic flood simulation model with a multi-objective optimisation algorithm (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II). The use of a high-resolution flood simulation model ensures the explicit representation of BGI and other land use features to simulate flow pathways and surface flood risk accurately, while the optimisation algorithm guarantees achieving the best costbenefit trade-offs for given BGI options. The current study uses the advanced CityCAT hydrodynamic flood model to evaluate the efficiency of the optimisation framework and the impact of location and size of permeable interventions on the optimisation process and subsequent cost-benefit trade-offs. This is achieved by dividing permeable surface areas into intervention zones of varying size and quantity. Furthermore, rainstorm events with 100-year and 30-year return periods are analysed to identify any common optimal solutions for different rainfall intensities. Depending on the number of intervention locations, the automated framework reliably achieves optimal BGI implementation solutions in a fraction of the time required to find the best solutions by trialling all possible options. Designing and optimising interventions with smaller sizes but many permeable zones save a good fraction of investment. However, such a design scheme requires more computational time to find optimal options. Furthermore, the optimal spatial configuration of BGI varies with different rainstorm severities, suggesting a need for careful selection of the rainstorm return period.

Previous research had examined the interactions between the various ESEE systems and their effects on public health. However, relatively few studies had conducted comprehensive analyses across different systems and regions. This paper aimed to conduct an in-depth analysis in this field. First, it calculated the ESEE development levels using principal component analysis, the entropy method, and data from 278 Chinese cities between 2012 and 2021. Next, it employed a coupling coordination degree model, which reflects the degree of coordinated development between different systems, to explore the coordinated development levels and trends of the four ESEE systems in each prefecture-level city. Furthermore, this paper innovatively used a spatial Durbin model, incorporating ESEE coordination levels to investigate their impact on public health in local and surrounding areas. The results indicated that the positive impact of ESEE coordinated development on local public health was 0.5082, while the impact on surrounding areas was 2.0240.

Prior arts concentrate on forecasting the flow evolution from bike demand records. Nevertheless, a tricky reality is the frequent occurrence of missing bike flow, which hinders us from accurately understanding flow patterns. This study investigates an interesting task, i.e., Bike-sharing demand r ecovery ( Biker ). Biker is not a simple time-series imputation problem, rather, it confronts three concerns: observation uncertainty, complex dependencies, and environmental facts. To this end, we present a novel diffusion probabilistic solution with factual knowledge fusion, namely DBiker. . Specifically, DBiker is the first attempt to extend the diffusion probabilistic models to the Biker task, along with a conditional Markov decision-making process. In contrast to existing probabilistic solutions, DBiker forecasts missing observations through progressive steps guided by an adaptive prior. Particularly, we introduce a Flow Conditioner with step embedding and a Factual Extractor to explore the complex dependencies and multiple environmental facts, respectively. Additionally, we devise a self-gated fusion layer that adaptively selects valuable knowledge to act as an adaptive prior, guiding the generation of missing observations.

Row_459,"Currently, the goals of sponge city construction mostly focus on urban surface water, with few considerations of groundwater indicators, and there is a lack of simulation methods that consider the interaction between surface water and groundwater under low impact development (LID) scenarios. Taking a sponge campus in Xi'an as the research object, this paper proposes a method to realize the interaction between surface water and groundwater at different spatial and temporal scales, so as to construct a SWMM-MODFLOW coupled numerical model to carry out the analysis of hydrological effect of sponge city comprehensively taking into account both surface water and groundwater. Simultaneously, the SWMM is coupled with the NSGA-III algorithm for multi-objective optimization of LID facility configurations, aiming to identify a globally optimal solution set for LID facility configurations under both long and short-duration rainfall scenarios. A novel framework for a comprehensive evaluation system of surface water-groundwater benefits is also developed to comprehensively assess LID facility optimization schemes that meet the goals of stormwater runoff infiltration and reduction, pollution interception and purification, and groundwater recharge conservation. The simulation results show that after optimization, the LID scheme has good surface runoff regulation effects and pollution reduction capabilities, reducing the runoff peak from 2.297 m3/s 3 /s to 2.128 m3/s, 3 /s, significantly lowering the risk of inundation and effectively reducing the total suspended solids (SS) load by 42.38 kg at the outfall. Meanwhile, the groundwater recharge effect is particularly significant in September. Compared to the baseline scenario, the average groundwater levels from June to September were raised by 3.966 cm, 5.120 cm, 6.743 cm, and 7.639 cm, respectively. The maximum daily groundwater level rise reached 7.82 cm, while the average groundwater level for the whole year of 2023 increased by 2.61 cm.

Here we use airborne measurements from the 2018 Western Wildfire Experiment for Cloud Chemistry, Aerosol Absorption, and Nitrogen (WE-CAN) to parameterize emissions of reactive nitrogen (NOy) from wildfires into peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN; 37%), NO3- (27%), and NO (36%) in a global chemistry-climate model with 13 km spatial resolution over the contiguous US. The NOy partitioning, compared with emitting all NOy as NO, reduces model ozone bias in near-fire smoke plumes sampled by the aircraft and enhances ozone downwind by 5-10 ppbv when Canadian smoke plumes travel to Washington, Utah, Colorado, and Texas. Using multi-platform observations, we identify the smoke-influenced days with daily maximum 8-hr average (MDA8) ozone of 70-88 ppbv in Kennewick, Salt Lake City, Denver and Dallas. On these days, wildfire smoke enhanced MDA8 ozone by 5-25 ppbv, through ozone produced remotely during plume transport and locally via interactions of smoke plume with urban emissions.Wildfires have torn across western North America over the last decade. Smoke from wildland fires in Canada can travel thousands of kilometers to US cities and reacts with urban pollution to create harmful ozone, a criteria pollutant regulated by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Accurately quantifying this impact is needed to inform US air quality policy, but is challenging due to complex physical and chemical processes. In this study, we analyze surface and airborne measurements, alongside a new variable-resolution global chemistry-climate model, to better understand these processes. We show that the near-field conversion of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from wildfires to peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) and other more oxidized forms reduces their localized impacts on ozone. PAN is the principal tropospheric reservoir for NOx radicals. When aged smoke plumes descend southward from Canada toward US cities, higher temperatures cause PAN to decompose and thus help production of ozone during smoke transport. On days when the observed ozone levels exceed the air quality limit (70 ppbv for 8-hr average), wildfire smoke can contribute 5-25 ppbv.Sequestration of wildfire NOx emissions in Canada as peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) enhances the downwind impacts on US O3 air quality Pyrogenic volatile organic compounds and PAN decomposition increase the contribution of aged Canadian smoke plumes to O3 in US cities Accounting for these effects in a high-resolution chemistry-climate model improves simulation of smoke-impacted high-O3 events in US cities","Lin, Meiyun","Horowitz, Larry W.","Hu, Lu","Permar, Wade",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,wildfire smoke,urban ozone,reactive nitrogen,long-range transport,air quality,climate change,,,,,,,,,AUG 16 2024,Reactive Nitrogen Partitioning Enhances the Contribution of Canadian Wildfire Plumes to US Ozone Air Quality

However, the control effect of Best Management Practices (BMPs) for NPS pollution is not yet clear under future scenarios. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was coupled with the entropy-weighted method, global climate patterns and land-use data to explore the dynamic variations in total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) loads in the Jing River Basin during the baseline (2000-2020) and future periods (2021-2065), evaluate the pollution reduction effectiveness of individual and combined BMPs, and propose practical BMP configurations. Results indicate that a future trend of urban land expansion, particularly in the economic scenario (LU_SSP585), leads to weakened environmental ecosystems, while the sustainable scenario (LU_SSP126) exhibits more balanced land development. The MIROC-ES2L model demonstrates higher Taylor skill scores, forecasted significant increases in precipitation, maximum, and minimum temperatures under the SSP585 scenario. Spatial heterogeneity in TN and TP loads is notable, showing an upward trajectory in the future. The interaction between land-use and climate change has complex effects on TN and TP loads, with land-use-induced TN changes being relatively small (4.6 %) and TP changes substantial (24.3 %). The spatial distribution, under overlying effects, leans towards the influence of climate change, emphasizing its dominant role in TN and TP load variations. Distinct differences exist in the reduction of NPS pollution loads among different BMPs, with combined BMPs demonstrating superior effectiveness. The environmental-cost effectiveness trends of BMPs remain consistent across various future scenarios. RG (Return agricultural land to grass), RG + TT (Terracing), and RG + FR10 (Fertilizer reduction: 10 %) + GW (Grassed waterway) + FS (Filter strip) + TT emerge as the most effective single, double, and multiple BMP combinations, respectively.

We examine the driving roles of network structure characteristics, sister city attributes, and control variables. Key findings include that network density (outdegree) positively and insignificantly influences the formation of these networks, while activity plus popularity foster these connections. For city attributes, institutional distance and geographical similarity (both coastal cities) play a positive driving force in the development of sister cities. By contrast, cultural distance similarity negatively affects the dynamic development of these ties.

The PRISMA methodology and frequency analysis were used to extract and analyze the literature. According to our selection criteria, 95 papers were included in the final analysis. Results revealed that: i) 53 % of papers focuses on social vulnerability related to flood hazard, ii) 61 % of case studies include hazard assessment, while the rest only investigate the socio-economic component of vulnerability, iii) Portugal and Italy are the most investigated countries, iv) 51,6 % of papers carry out an integrated approach. The review underlines a pronounced perception of the scientific community to the more recurrent events (floods) rather than to the number of deaths (heat waves), leading to a discussion on the effected of climate change and suggestions for emergency planning in highly developed countries. Finally, a scheme of data integration between hazard, vulnerability and exposure is proposed.","Lapietra, Isabella","Colacicco, Rosa","Capolongo, Domenico","La Salandra, Marco","Rinaldi, Anna","Dellino, Pierfrancesco",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION,Social vulnerability,Hazard assessment,Systematic review,Multidisciplinary approach,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 15 2024,Unveiling social vulnerability to natural hazards in the EEA and UK: A systematic review with insights for enhanced emergency planning and risk reduction
Row_482,"The remote region of the South China Sea (SCS), situated far from urban mainland areas, is commonly perceived to experience minimal pollution. However, this may evolve into a considerably polluted region owing to increasing anthropogenic pollutants. In this study, we employ a multidisciplinary approach to analyze the surface sediments collected from the offshore area of the southern SCS. Our aim is to explore potential anthropogenic pollutants, their interactions, and the related controlling factors. This research endeavors to enhance our understanding of the current pollution status in the SCS and help making relevant policy management decisions. Comparison with previous reports reveals that now, the area is more extensively and increasingly contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons and heavy metals (Cd and As) than before. For the first time, we report the recognition of coprostanol and long-chain alkyl mid-chain ketones, unveiling the noticeable incorporation of sewage fecal matter and biomass burning into offshore sediments. Moreover, sedimentary multipollutants (except ketones) exhibit strong correlations with terrestrial elements and fine-sized particles, displaying a roughly highwest/low-east spatial variability in pollutant accumulation or enrichment. These signatures evidently demonstrate the major impact of river discharges (e.g., the Mekong River to the west and the Pearl and Red Rivers to the north) on the SCS. They have hydrodynamic effects on the subsequent basin-wide dispersal of pollutants, driven by monsoon-induced large- and regional-scale currents. The different behavior of burning-related ketones may be partly due to their aerosol form, leading to atmospheric transportation.

Row_489,"Air pollution has a significant impact on human health and influences housing choices. Existing studies on determinant factors affecting property prices, including air pollution, mainly employed hedonic and spatial regression models that have limitations in capturing non-linear relationships and local interactions. Neglecting the non-linear relationships can lead to incomplete estimation impacts between explainable features and prices. To fill these gaps, this study used machine learning algorithms and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to identify the relative importance of air pollutant variables on land values and their non-linear mechanism. The results showed that the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) outperformed Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), and Extra Tree Regression (ETR) models in price prediction and capturing the non-linear relationship between air pollution and land values. Notably, Ozone (O3) and Nitric Oxide (NO) concentrations contribute 1.64% and 1.47% to land value variation, respectively. The results confirmed the non-linear relationship and identified that the threshold effect between air pollution and land values is at mean concentration values. Furthermore, we observed that the negative influence of O3 and NO on land values appears as their concentration level is higher than 29.3 and 13 ppb, respectively. This paper contributes valuable insights by advancing our understanding of the non-linear mechanism impact of air pollution on house and land values, informing environmental policymaking, and shedding light on housing decisions.","Doan, Quang Cuong","Chen, Chen","He, Shenjing","Zhang, Xiaohu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,Air pollution,House prices,Non-linear relationship,Machine learning,New York city,,,,,,,,,,JAN 1 2024,How urban air quality affects land values: Exploring non-linear and threshold mechanism using explainable artificial intelligence
Row_490,"Historical land cover (LC) maps are significant geospatial data sources used to understand past land characteristics and accurately determine the long-term land changes that provide valuable insights into the interactions between human activities and the environment over time. This article introduces a novel open LC benchmark dataset generated from very high spatial resolution historical Hexagon (KH-9) reconnaissance satellite images to be used in deep learning (DL)-based image segmentation tasks. This new benchmark dataset, which includes very high-resolution (VHR) mono-band Hexagon images of several Turkish and Bulgarian territories from the 1970s and 1980s, covers a large geographic area. Our dataset includes eight LC classes inspired by the European Space Agency (ESA) WorldCover project except for the tree class, which we divided into subclasses, namely agricultural fruit trees and other trees. We implemented widely used U-Net++ and DeepLabv3+ segmentation architectures with appropriate hyperparameters and backbone structures to demonstrate the versatility and impact of our HexaLCSeg dataset and to compare the performance of these models for accurate and fast LC mapping of past terrain conditions. We achieved the highest accuracy using U-Net++ with an SE-ResNeXt50 backbone and obtained an F1-score of 0.8804. The findings of this study can be applied to different geographical regions with similar Hexagon images, providing valuable contributions to the field of remote sensing and LC mapping.
