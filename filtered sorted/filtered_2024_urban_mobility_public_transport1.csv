Row_19,"The outbreak of COVID-19 caused unprecedented disruptions to public transport services. As such, this paper proposes a methodology for analyzing COVID-19 impact on public transport mobility. The proposed methodology includes: (1) a new unsupervised machine learning (UML) method, which utilizes a decoder-encoder architecture and a flow property-based learning objective function, to estimate the origin-destination (OD) flows of public transport systems from boarding-alighting data; and (2) a temporal-spatial analysis method to analyze OD flow change before and during COVID-19 to unveil its impact on mobility across time and space. The validation of the UML method showed that it achieved a coefficient of determination of 0.836 when estimating OD flows using boarding-alighting data. Upon the successful validation, the proposed methodology was implemented to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on the mobility of the New York City subway system. The implementation results indicate that (1) the rise in the number of weekly new COVID-19 cases intensified the impact on the public transport mobility, but not as strongly as public health interventions; and (2) the inflows to and outflows from the center of the city were more sensitive to the impact of COVID-19.","Zhang, Lan","Liu, Kaijian",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,CITIES,COVID-19,Urban mobility,Origin-destination flow estimation,Unsupervised machine learning,,,,,,,,AUG 2024,Unsupervised origin-destination flow estimation for analyzing COVID-19 impact on public transport mobility
Row_22,"Research on public transport systems is continually driven by the societal benefits of transport services. However, the nuanced effects of the built environment on public transport mode shares across different modes have received little attention. Using multi-source travel data from Shenzhen, this study presents an analytical framework, which integrates the light gradient boosting machine and Shapley additive explanations, to delve into the complex interplay among public transport modes. The results reveal that most origin-destination pairs with available metro services exhibit a metro share exceeding 50%, underscoring the high attractiveness of the metro. Travel distance emerges as the primary determinant of mode share, with transport-related characteristics proving more influential than land use modifications. This study identifies nonlinear effects of the built environment on mode share, with specific thresholds for built environment characteristics suggesting fine-tuned planning strategies. Metro station densities of 2 counts/km2 correlates with increased metro share, while bus stop densities of 15 counts/km2 are associated with higher bus share. Areas within 2 km of a metro station or with bus stop densities below 15 counts/km2 tend to have higher bike shares. Specific land use ratios and high levels of land use mix are linked to increased shares of certain modes. The findings suggest optimizing bus services in relation to metro availability and offer guidance for balanced planning in promoting metro and shared mobility to achieve a sustainable transport system.","Li, Zhitao","Tang, Jinjun","Yu, Tianjian","Liu, Biao","Cao, Junqiang",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,Public transport,Mode share,Built environment,LightGBM,Non-linear associations,,,,,,,NOV 10 2024,Understanding the interplay among urban public transport modes: Spatial variation and built environment effects
Row_35,"As digital mobility platforms, such as ride-hailing apps, have become more widespread and popular, they have garnered public and scholarly interest as potential solutions to challenges of climate change, insufficient mobility services, urban congestion and pollution. This paper examines the potential of ride-hailing platforms through a more critical lens. Thereby I draw attention to how platform transportation workers in Mumbai, India, produce mobility services by collaboratively linking the social and material resources of the city. Networks and communities of transport workers have long been essential for providing intermediate mobility services in Mumbai, and continue to do so in the platform era. Building on these observations, I inquire whether there is potential for the creation of worker-centric platform models that benefit both the workers and the larger urban majority. Therefore, drawing on my fieldwork in Mumbai, I first explore how the current model of digital mobility platforms in Mumbai reinforces socio-spatial fragmentation in Mumbai while leaving workers with decreasing earnings and rising work pressure. Considering the agency of platform workers, I then aim to uncover how platform workers appropriate platform mechanisms and engage their collective knowledge and experiences in order to improve their working situation. I draw upon these insights to highlight how worker-centric approaches to digital mobility platforms can contribute to more inclusive and sustainable cities.","Kuttler, Tobias",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,URBAN STUDIES,alternative platform models,embeddedness,platform mobilities,platform urbanism,South Asia,,,,,,,JUL 2024,Urban mobilities in Mumbai: Towards worker-centric platformisation beyond 'urban solutionism'
Row_71,"This study explores the '15 -minute city' concept in Hamilton, New Zealand, focusing on challenges related to car dependency and urban sprawl. Triggered by the greater emphasis on sustainable urban environments following the global pandemic, the research employs a mobility -based approach to assess the model's applicability across various urban districts. Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping is used to identify 'liveable areas' in business, residential, and industrial districts where essential services are accessible within three different thresholds of 5, 10, and 15 min walking distance. This tiered approach offers a detailed view of urban accessibility, highlighting the practicality and varying implementation levels of the 15 -minute city concept across diverse urban areas. Geolocated mobile phone data from 88,660 residents is analysed with a focus on 'inflow' and 'outflow' travel distances at both city and district levels. While the results reveal the practical challenges of implementing the '15 -minute city' paradigm, they also show partial alignment of Hamilton's urban fabric with the paradigm, offering scope for adjustments to better suit the city's specific characteristics and residents' behaviours. The study highlights opportunities for enhancing the diversity and accessibility of amenities and improving public transportation and alternative transport options, all key factors for sustainable urban development. This adaptable methodology serves as a valuable reference for other cities in developing strategies for sustainable living. The study concludes that while Hamilton shows potential for transformation, a nuanced and locally focused approach is crucial. These insights contribute to the current new urbanist literature by providing a comprehensive city -district perspective, extending the discourse to include distances beyond the '15 -minute city' and highlighting areas where further urban planning or intervention is necessary.","Wang, Tianyi","Li, Yan","Chuang, I. -Ting","Qiao, Weijie","Jiang, Jing","Beattie, Lee",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,CITIES,15-Minute-city,Urban structure,Geolocated data,Human mobility analysis,GIS spatial analysis,,,,,,,AUG 2024,"Evaluating the 15-minute city paradigm across urban districts: A mobility-based approach in Hamilton, New Zealand"

These impacts can manifest through a disruption of social engagement and outdoor activities, which can negatively affect their mobility, overall quality of life, and well-being. This study employs a narrative review approach of 32 academic articles to identify various factors that can affect women's perception of safety in public places and while using public transport. We further selected 21 studies that provide substantive data on the built environment, individual characteristics, and social factors, while also examining their intersectionality. By adopting an intersectionality framework, we evaluated the relative importance of each factor based on its consistency and prominence in previous research and assessed their significance in contributing to women's perception of safety. The findings highlight the importance of urban design and built environment improvements, such as street lighting and walking path conditions, in enhancing women's perceived safety.

Crowdedness has therefore increasingly affected decisions such as a place visit via a specific path, the selection of a public transport stop, itinerary, etc., thereby making related information increasingly relevant. The objective of this study is to examine the route and travel choices of pedestrians and public transport users, with the provisioning of travel information related to crowdedness levels. To that end, a choice experiment was designed to elicit travelers' preferences. Discrete choice models were estimated based on data collected from 465 individuals in Greece. Results showed that crowd avoidance plays a significant role in shaping mobility decisions for both pedestrians and public transport users. Factors such as place of residence, age, the importance of COVID-19 measures and arrival time are found to affect the likelihood of switch routes in response to information about high levels of crowdedness.","Karatsoli, Maria","Nathanail, Eftihia","Basbas, Socrates","Cats, Oded",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,CITIES,Urban mobility,Discrete choice models,Pandemic,Crowdedness level,,,,,,,,JUN 2024,Crowdedness information and travel decisions of pedestrians and public transport users in the COVID-19 era: A stated preference analysis

Amidst efforts to shift modal preferences and reduce transport emissions, cities are turning to spatialbased policies, such as Superblocks, to reshape urban mobility. This research examines the electoral outcomes associated with the implementation of Superblocks in Barcelona, focusing on their impact on political support for Barcelona en Com & uacute; (BEC) during the local elections of 2015 and 2023. Utilizing a combination of adjusted difference-in-differences and propensity score matching methods, we assessed the public's electoral response to the Superblock initiative amidst a backdrop of declining city-wide support for BEC. Our findings reveal that Superblock areas demonstrated significantly stronger support for BEC, suggesting a political premium for the party responsible for these urban interventions. Specifically, electoral support in Superblock districts saw an increase of 10-14% compared to the rest of the city. This result highlights the potential of urban transformation policies to influence political preferences locally and potentially validate the use of local electoral data as a tool for evaluating public response to highly contested urban policies.","Marquet, Oriol","Nunez, Marta-Beatriz Fernndez","Maciejewska, Monika",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL,Superblocks,Electoral analysis,Urban policy acceptability,Sustainable urban planning,Policy evaluation,,,,,,,JUL 2024,The political price of superblocks.

Row_101,"Air quality and urban mobility are complex socioenvironmental issues faced by megacities, particularly those in the Global South. Investments in efficient and inclusive public transport networks, as well as encouraging active transport modals, can mitigate both traffic congestion and air pollution, leading to improved quality of life. Few studies have integrated the potential effects of a well-developed rail network in influencing modal choice - from motorised to active transport - and their impacts on pollutant emission and air quality through dynamic air quality models. In the megacity of Sao Paulo, the expansion of the subway system has not achieved the planned targets, as intended by state government plans. This induces the question ""What would have happened to air pollution if planned stations had been properly implemented?"" which this paper aims to answer, through the increased adoption of cycling or walking to and from railway stations. We applied the WRF-Chem air quality model to model the effects of railway development in a megacity, focusing on criteria pollutants. Results show that the more investments there are in public transport, by expanding the metro system, the more expressive are the decreases in air pollution, and the farther these benefits spread out spatially. More intense reductions in pollutant concentrations are predicted to occur near the new stations' buffers, but citizens living far from the metro stations will also benefit from these improvements. Additionally, modal change from car to walking/ cycling and subway in all trips within a radius of 1.3 km centered in existing and planned stations is expected to result in a decrease of 11.7 % in CO 2 eq vehicular emissions. Therefore, improvements in public transportation could help improving environmental and social justice, leading to better air quality and transport accessibility, decreasing public health problems and costs, while helping cities reach their GEE emissions reduction targets.","Chiquetto, Julio Barboza","Machado, Pedro Gerber","Mouette, Dominique","Ribeiro, Flavia Noronha Dutra",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,Urban mobility,Air pollution,Sao Paulo,Air quality modeling,Urban environment,Transportation planning,,,,,,OCT 1 2024,Air quality improvements from a transport modal change in the Sao Paulo megacity

Yet, detecting factors that reduce the use of cars is a serious challenge, particularly across different regions. Here, we model the use of various modes of transport in a city by aggregating Active mobility (A), Public Transport (B) and Cars (C), expressing the modal share of a city by its ABC triplet. Data for nearly 800 cities across 61 countries is used to model car use and its relationship with city size and income. Our findings suggest that with longer distances and the congestion experienced in large cities, Active mobility and journeys by Car are less frequent, but Public Transport is more prominent. Further, income is strongly related to the use of cars. Results show that a city with twice the income has 37% more journeys by Car. Yet, there are significant differences across regions. For cities in Asia, Public Transport contributes to a substantial share of their journeys. For cities in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, most of their mobility depends on Cars, regardless of city size. In Europe, there are vast heterogeneities in their modal share, from cities with mostly Active mobility (like Utrecht) to cities where Public Transport is crucial (like Paris or London) and cities where more than two out of three of their journeys are by Car (like Rome and Manchester).","Prieto-Curiel, Rafael","Ospina, Juan P.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL,Modal share,Vehicle kilometres travelled,Motorisation,Active travel,,,,,,,,MAR 2024,The ABC of mobility

Nevertheless, the increasing interest from scholars, CS companies' owners, and policymakers in car sharing services as a viable response to the sustainable urban transport has availed rather mixed considerations, thus calling for further scrutiny. The current endeavor thus seeks to advance a systematic literature review of the body of knowledge correlatively addressing the issues of various forms of smart mobility and car sharing. Four major research questions are envisaged, namely: What are the bibliometric characteristics of the literature related smart mobility and car sharing? What is the focus of this literature in terms of key concepts? What are limitations of the existing body of literature? and What are the implications of this literature in terms of future research avenues? With a view to providing pertinent answers, emphasis will be laid on the insights, critique, transformative redefinitions of the literature in the field via a bibliometric analysis and structured theme-based review. The SPAR-4-SLR protocol is employed while the data retrieved from the Scopus database was processed with the Bibliometrix package (i.e., Biblioshiny) of the R study program.

This paper aims to answer these questions by examining and decoding the prevailing ""formal street classification scheme model"" through conducting a detailed worldwide review of formal national street classification plans. Out of 196 countries investigated, 128 official street classification plans were identified, analysed and evaluated. We also used an Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) with 20 experts coming from different fields (i.e., academics, policymakers, practitioners) to enhance our results and contribute to developing an index evaluating urban street classification under the prism of sustainability. The outcomes of our work signify that conventional pro-automobile approaches still prevail, thus shaping car-centric conditions, which undermine the role of sustainable modes and reduce the ability of cities to innovate and succeed. It is demonstrated that the road to achieve sustainability and completeness in urban transport systems, considering these car-led plans, is still uphill. Based on that, multi-dimensional classification systems prioritising public and active transport, while appreciating street's urban aspect should be promoted in the future.","Tsigdinos, Stefanos","Salamouras, Georgios","Chatziioannou, Ioannis","Bakogiannis, Efthimios","Nikitas, Alexandros",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,CITIES,Street classification,Road network hierarchy,Formal planning,Sustainable mobility,Transport planning,Urban development,,,,,,NOV 2024,A worldwide review of formal national street classification plans enhanced via an analytical hierarchy process: Street classification as a tool for more sustainable cities

In this article, we update the Urban Network Analysis pedestrian modeling framework designed to link land use and urban development changes with pedestrian mobility outcomes by introducing new methods for capturing the effects of street properties on pedestrian travel demand and adjusting pedestrian trip generation rates with k-nearest accessibility scores based on destination availability in each context. This framework was used in conjunction with a participatory design process in Beirut, Lebanon to estimate pedestrian mobility impacts of three urban design scenarios. We illustrate how each scenario affects pedestrian trip generation across various trip types and trip distribution on individual street segments. Our approach demonstrates how urban design interventions-both land use changes and street quality improvements-can influence pedestrian travel demand.

Row_157,"Road traffic is the primary source of environmental noise pollution in cities. This problem is also spreading due to inadequate urban expansion planning. Hence, integrating road traffic noise analysis into urban planning is necessary for reducing city noise in an effective, adaptable, and sustainable way. This study aims to develop a methodology that applies to any city for the stratification of urban roads by their functionality through only their urban features. It is intended to be a tool to cluster similar streets and, consequently, traffic noise to enable urban and transportation planners to support the reduction of people's noise exposure. Three multivariate ordered logistic regression statistical models (Model 1, 2, and 3) are presented that significantly stratify urban roads into five, four, and three categories, respectively. The developed models exhibit a McFadden pseudo-R-2 between 0.5 and 0.6 (equivalent to R-2 >0.8). The choice between Model 1 or 2 depends on the scale of the city. Model 1 is recommended for developed cities with an extensive road network, while Model 2 is most suitable in intermediate and growing cities. On the other hand, Model 3 could be applied at any city scale but focused on local management of transit routes and for designing acoustic sensor installations, urban soundwalks, and identification of quiet areas. Urban features related to road width and length, presence of transport infrastructure, and public transport routes are associated with increased traffic noise in all three models. These models prove useful for future action plans aimed at reducing noise through strategic urban planning.","Montenegro, Alexandra L.","Rey-Gozalo, Guillermo","Arenas, Jorge P.","Suarez, Enrique",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,Road traffic noise,Urban sound environment,Sustainable urban planning,Multinomial ordered logistic regression,,,,,,,,JUL 1 2024,Streets classification models by urban features for road traffic noise estimation
Row_163,"Micromobility has emerged as a crucial trend in transportation, and through its adoption, positive impacts can be realized in urban mobility, environmental sustainability, and public health. However, the enablers and barriers to micromobility adoption have not been fully understood and classified. Moreover, these factors have not been compared at urban and suburban levels hindering their widespread acceptance and adoption, which differ among various regions. Current study aims to address this knowledge gap by reviewing the literature published over the past decade on private and shared micromobility vehicles, such as bicycles, e-bikes, and e-scooters. The following two review methodologies are applied: a bibliometric analysis and a systematic analysis. The bibliometric analysis includes 3729 publications, provides a global overview of the micromobility literature and identifies relevant research directions through performance analysis and science mapping. The systematic analysis consists of 54 selected articles out of 1670 from the refined search algorithm. The identified enablers and barriers are classified into three levels of influence: micro (personal perception), meso (social and natural environment), and macro (general aspects of transport modes and policy). The results indicate a rise in pro-environmental attitudes and a desire for healthy and convenient transportation. Major barriers to micromobility adoption include poor regulations, safety concerns, and insufficient infrastructure in suburban areas. Furthermore, the lack of research on suburban context highlights the need for comprehensive studies on micromobility across diverse regions, which is critical for the development of tailored micromobility solutions that can improve the adoption rates across various socio-economic and geographical settings.","Bobicic, Ognjen","Esztergar-Kiss, Domokos",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,Micromobility,Adoption,Urban,Suburban,Bibliometric analysis,Systematic review,,,,,,DEC 15 2024,Enablers and barriers to micromobility adoption: Urban and suburban contexts
Row_166,"Public transit offers urban populations physical accessibility to resources and opportunities. However, at the same time, transit trips often expose users to extreme environmental conditions, such as extreme heat and cold since transit journeys usually include out-of-vehicle trip segments including walking and waiting. Such exposure can be considered as environmental health costs because exposure to weather extremes can lead to adverse health outcomes. Even worse, climate change is increasing the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. In this context, how can we make public transit accessibility measures ready for climate change? This paper attempts to answer this question by developing a generalized cost function approach combining travel time and environmental health costs into an integrated measure of dual accessibility: a measure of the travel costs of accessing a fixed number of destinations. We synthesize transport science, environmental health, remote sensing, and urban climatology to empower the proposed framework. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed method, we carry out an example study that incorporates transit passengers' extreme cold exposure into accessibility measures in the city of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Further, we perform a social equity analysis to investigate whether the increase in total integrated costs (i.e., decrease in accessibility) due to the inclusion of environmental health costs disproportionately affects socially disadvantaged population groups. The proposed method enables a more realistic and practical measurement of public transit accessibility under climate change; thereby, improving the readiness and resilience of our society and transport systems for future challenges.","Ahmed, Naser","Lee, Jinhyung","Liu, Luyu","Kim, Junghwan","Jang, Kee Moon","Wang, Jinfei",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS,Environmental health,Public transit,Accessibility,Extreme weather exposure,Climate change,Social equity,,,,,,SEP 2024,The cost of climate change: A generalized cost function approach for incorporating extreme weather exposure into public transit accessibility

In this study, we analyze spatial accessibility to various opportunities in Finland at 1 km resolution and assess accessibility inequalities using the Palma ratio. Furthermore, we test how a web-based tool can be used in stakeholder communication and investigate the usefulness of the accessibility indicators and the tool for planning practice based on focus group discussions with Finnish transport planners. Our results show significant variation in the levels of access to different opportunities across Finnish municipalities. The Palma ratios reveal that the largest disparities are typically located in municipalities surrounding large city regions, where wealthier residents tend to have better access to opportunities compared to low-income populations.

This study conducted a questionnaire survey among a Singaporean population, collecting data from 1953 respondents on their demographic profiles as well as their behaviour, attitudes, and willingness to pay for disposable plastic bags. The survey data suggest a supportive environment in Singapore for introducing charges on disposable plastic bags with most respondents preferred a charge of SGD 0.10 or below.

Further analysis of the effects of imposed charges revealed that a charge that is too low appears to have a limited impact on reducing the overall usage of disposable plastic bags, whereas a charge that is too high is likely to yield diminishing returns and could potentially lead to an increase in public complaints.

Row_263,"Although many cities are incentivizing non-auto modes of transportation in response to the climate crisis, their sustainable mobility transition efforts are being challenged by the rising intensity and frequency of heatwaves. Pedestrians are exposed to high levels of heat stress on hot days, which may reduce their willingness to walk. It is thus important to understand how heat affects pedestrian behavior and accessibility, so that climate mitigation strategies can be better targeted to support walking as a mode of transport but also as a first-/last-mile connection to public transit. In this study, we used a dataset of pedestrian trips undertaken during the summer of 2014 in Boston, MA. Along with several route attributes (such as length, turns, sidewalk width, amenities, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and Sky View Factor), we also included a measure of heat stress (Universal Thermal Climate Index - UTCI) to explain pedestrian route choice behavior. Using path-size logistic regression models, we found evidence to suggest that heat stress has a considerable and statistically significant effect on the perceived walking distance. We also found that the effect was non-uniform and possibly exponential. Additionally, we illustrated the extent to which heat stress can reduce pedestrian accessibility to important destinations (such as public transit). This reduction was significant on a typical summer day, with an even sharper reduction on the hottest summer day. Non-White residents were observed to have lower accessibility levels compared to all pedestrians, likely because of disparities in urban heat exposure. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating heat exposure into transportation planning and urban design frameworks, especially with an equity lens to address unequal consequences.","Basu, Rounaq","Colaninno, Nicola","Alhassan, Aziz","Sevtsuk, Andres",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,CITIES,Heat stress,Thermal comfort,Willingness to walk,Pedestrian route choice,Accessibility,,,,,,,DEC 2024,Hot and bothered: Exploring the effect of heat on pedestrian route choice behavior and accessibility
Row_271,"The restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic have led to significant changes in travel behaviour and public activities, and they might have contributed to changes in residential location choices. However, research examining the relationship between residential location choice and COVID-19 is very limited. To that end, this paper focuses on how pandemic-induced changes in work patterns, travel preferences and daily activity patterns have altered residential preferences and potentially, relocation trends. The main determinants of residential location choice have been established in the literature over the past 30 years: physical attributes of the dwelling; surrounding built environment; affordability; and accessibility to transportation, workplaces, and services. However, each of these determinants are prioritised differently depending on the circumstances. Therefore, exploring how these priorities have shifted after the pandemic can pave the way for understanding how preferences for residential location choice shift as a consequence. From the review, the key findings include the decreasing importance of transport and workplace accessibility in residential location choice after the pandemic. Firstly, teleworking is becoming more prevalent within office jobs than before the pandemic, leading to less frequent trips to conventional workplaces, reducing the need to live within a commutable distance to a workplace. Secondly, trips to other activities have likewise become less frequent due to either remote alternatives (e. g., online shopping) or shifting towards services closer to home, reducing the need to travel in general. Another consequence of the pandemic is people staying at home longer than before, thus increasing the need for more desirable dwelling attributes such as larger house size and wider surrounding green space. Since these attributes are generally more affordable in areas less accessible to transport and services, this may subsequently lead to migrations to areas of lower population density, potentially decentralising urban areas.","Ilham, Mostafa Ayman","Fonzone, Achille","Fountas, Grigorios","Mora, Luca",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,CITIES,Residential location choice,Urban decentralisation,Travel behaviour,Activity behaviour,COVID-19,Post -pandemic,Teleworking,,,,,AUG 2024,To move or not to move: A review of residential relocation trends after COVID-19
Row_272,"Cities are challenged to provide older adults with high-quality neighborhoods that foster their mental health. Older adults with low socioeconomic position (SEP) are at risk for poor mental health, but research in this group is scarce. The neighborhood may have an impact on older adults' mental health through the elicitation of emotions. Qualitative on-site research can provide detailed and context-sensitive information on the experienced emotions. The aim of this walk-along study was to identify which emotions older adults with low SEP experience when they walk in their neighborhood and the physical and social neighborhood environmental characteristics that influence these emotions. Twenty-four older adults with low SEP were interviewed and content analysis was performed using NVivo 12 software. Participants experienced various positive emotions (e.g., calmness) in green and blue spaces, spaces with historical buildings, and open spaces. They experienced negative emotions (e.g., frustration) in spaces with heavy traffic and crime, paths with uneven surfaces, and areas with a lack of services, infrastructure and maintenance. The presence of public transport, renovations, graffiti, and cultural diversity evoked mixed emotions. Insights from this study could be used to develop specific hypotheses in quantitative studies and by urban planners and policy makers when (re-)designing neighborhoods.","Jacobs, Noortje","Deforche, Benedicte","Van Puyvelde, Amber","Van Dyck, Delfien","Mertens, Lieze","Veitch, Jenny","Van Cauwenberg, Jelle",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,CITIES,Mental health,Urban neighborhood environment,Qualitative method,Walking interview,Healthy ageing,Vulnerable groups,,,,,,JUN 2024,Exploring emotions in relation to neighborhood environmental characteristics among older adults with low socioeconomic position: A qualitative study using walk-along interviews
Row_286,"While urban pedestrianisation schemes typically attract vociferous opposition, it is often unclear whether these negative views are representative of the general population. For this reason, understanding how residents perceive the impacts of such schemes is critical to their evaluation. To this aim, this article assesses residents' perceptions and preferences regarding the pedestrianisation of multiple streets in the Eixample district of Barcelona in recent years, through a representative survey of the district's residents (n = 1211). Our research examines how residents' views on pedestrianisation vary depending on their mobility habits, sociodemographic background, and the level of traffic calming of the street they live on. Our results show that most respondents (66%) consider that the impacts of existing pedestrianisations have been positive regardless of whether they live on a pedestrianised street or not, even though residents of recently pedestrianised streets are more positive than those living on other streets. At the same time, many residents of pedestrianised streets consider that the benefits of reduced traffic externalities may be partially counterbalanced by new problems caused by an intensive use of public space (e.g. noise from people and cafes, touristification, nightlife). Our results also show that there is a strong relationship between support for pedestrianisation, age and mobility habits: daily car and motorbike users are much less supportive of pedestrianisation than public transport users and cyclists, while support for pedestrianisation decreases markedly with advancing age.","Nello-Deakin, Samuel","Vallve, Candela Sancho","Akinci, Zeynep Sila",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,HABITAT INTERNATIONAL,Pedestrianisation,Barcelona,Superblocks,Street transformation,Resident survey,,,,,,,AUG 2024,Who's afraid of pedestrianisation?

Row_293,"This research investigates the potential of Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) to eliminate Conventional Private Vehicles (CPVs) towards sustainable carfree cities. Besides internal-city CPV travellers, travellers with external trips (either origins or destinations are outside the city) are also shifted to SAVs or Public Transit (PT) based on individuals' utilities with Park-and-Ride (PnR) initiatives. Our research presents a new PnR allocation approach optimising PnR facilities selections. Then, several Agent-Based Modellings (ABM) are conducted using MATSim. Brussels, the capital of Belgium, is selected as the case study area. The outcomes reveal the significant impacts of PnR market penetration and SAV pricing strategies. The proposed carfree initiatives bring notable benefits, including reduced congestion in the city centre and significant transport emission reductions. However, there are also drawbacks, such as longer travel time for PnR travellers and increased congestion in specific regions. Consequently, a PnR market penetration between 40% to 60% represents a feasible range under the current Brussels mobility network. Furthermore, SAVs should be seen as a complement to PT rather than with a very low fare structure. Generally, our findings emphasise the necessity for a multifaceted approach for different stakeholders to maximise SAV benefits towards more sustainable mobility networks.","Li, Jingjun","Rombaut, Evy","Vanhaverbeke, Lieselot",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS,Shared autonomous vehicle,Park -and -ride,Carfree City,External Travellers,Agent -based simulation,,,,,,,SEP 2024,How far are we towards sustainable Carfree cities combining shared autonomous vehicles with park-and-ride: An agent-based simulation assessment for Brussels
Row_294,"Canadian cities have made significant investments in cycling infrastructure to support uptake in active transportation. Who has spatial access to supportive infrastructure is an important equity question: lack of access to safe infrastructure for cycling may limit who has an option to use a bicycle to meet their transportation needs (to access employment, educational, social, or other essential services) as well as who may achieve the physical and mental health benefits possible through physical activity. Our aim is to measure spatial access to cycling infrastructure in Canadian cities, and to provide a broad, national understanding of inequitable access to cycling infrastructure for equity-deserving populations (children, seniors, recent immigrants, visible minorities, and people with low incomes). Accordingly, we used a national dataset of cycling infrastructure (Can-BICS), which summarizes the quantity of cycling infrastructure for all dissemination areas in Canada, and 2016 Census data to estimate associations between area-level sociodemographic characteristics and access to cycling infrastructure. In unadjusted associations, equity-deserving groups (i.e., recent immigrants and people with low incomes) had better access to cycling infrastructure. Pearson coefficients highlighted variations in the equity of cycling infrastructure across cities. Overall, access was more equitable across equity-deserving groups in large cities, compared to mid-sized and small cities. After adjusting for covariates related to urban form and mode share, access to cycling infrastructure was higher in areas with more seniors, more recent immigrants, more visible minorities, and more people with low incomes, but lower in areas with more children. More importantly, there are still a substantial number of people from equity-deserving groups living in areas with very low levels of cycling infrastructure. For example, similar to 1.5 million children under the age of 14 (31% of children), 1.5 million older adults (31%), 1.4 million visible minorities, and 0.5 million people with low income (20%) live in dissemination areas with the lowest level of cycling infrastructure. These results highlight the need to understand which populations stand to gain by cycling infrastructure investments and which populations are being left behind. This methodology represents a useful tool for information transport policy initiatives to advance bicycle equity at a national scale.","Zhao, Qiao","Winters, Meghan","Nelson, Trisalyn","Laberee, Karen","Ferster, Colin","Manaugh, Kevin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS,Equity,Active transportation,Cycling infrastructure,,,,,,,,,JUN 2024,Who has access to cycling infrastructure in Canada?

Row_300,"Investigating the spatiotemporal characteristics of residents' intercity travel affected by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is of great significance to understanding and extending the impact of major public health affairs on intercity travelers, urban management policies, and intercity cooperative interactions. Taking 366 cities in China as an example, this study proposed a novel research framework for analyzing the spatiotemporal characteristics of intercity population flows. Using AutoNavi population migration big data sets from web crawling, the spatiotemporal structure patterns of intercity travel in China from January 1st to June 30th, 2020 were extracted by using the singular value decomposition (SVD) method. Then the spatial organization patterns of intercity travel networks in China and its five major urban agglomerations were identified by the weighted stochastic block model (WSBM). The results showed that the total volume of intercity travel in China and its five major urban agglomerations experienced a process of rapid decline followed by a slow recovery, presenting a ""Vshaped"" distribution since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Three distinctive intercity travel patterns, namely the stable, holiday, and weekday-weekend intercity trip patterns, were extracted from the spatiotemporal OD matrix of intercity travel. Strong intercity travels were mainly distributed in eastern and central China, forming an intercity travel pattern in which core cities pushed and pulled each other within the national urban agglomerations. However, intercity migration flows were dominated by weak-intensity flows. Intercity trips during the holidays had a phenomenon of ""escaping from the metropolis"". Meanwhile, it had significant spatial proximity and directionality. The daily intercity trips were characterized by a remarkable periodicity with seven days as a repeat. A more interesting finding is that when weekends overlap with holidays, intercity travel on the 1-2 days before the vacations has presented an effect of ""suppression travel"". Furthermore, at the national scale, the stable intercity travel network has formed a polycentric core-periphery structure of ""Three Cores-Six Semiperipheries-Five Peripheries"". At the urban agglomeration scale, they formed respectively distinguished monocentric, bicentric, and polycentric core-periphery structures.","Wei, Shimei","Pan, Jinghu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,CITIES,Intercity travel,Spatiotemporal pattern,Singular value decomposition (SVD),Weighted stochastic block model (WSBM),COVID-19,AutoNavi migration index (AMI),China,,,,,SEP 2024,Spatiotemporal characteristics of residents' intercity travel in China under the impact of COVID-19 pandemic
