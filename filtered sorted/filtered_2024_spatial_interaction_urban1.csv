Row_1,"Urban land use is central to urban planning. With the emergence of urban big data and advances in deep learning methods, several studies have leveraged graph convolutional networks (GCNs) with local functional characteristics from points of interest data and spatial features from flow data to infer urban land use. However, these studies cannot distinguish spatial interaction and spatial dependence in terms of conceptualization and modeling mechanisms and overlook the inadequacy of GCNs in modeling spatial interaction. This study proposes a novel framework-a heterogeneous graph convolutional network (HGCN)-to explicitly account for the spatial demand and supply components embedded in spatial interaction data. Several experiments, including 19 different models and datasets from Shenzhen and London, were conducted to validate the proposed framework and its generalizability within the same and different spatial contexts. The HGCN can distinguish heterogeneous mechanisms in supply- and demand-related modalities of spatial interactions, incorporating both spatial interaction and spatial dependence for urban land-use inference. Empowered by HGCN, we found that spatial interaction features play a distinctively crucial role in urban land-use inference compared to local attributes and spatial dependence features. In addition, our findings highlight the superiority of HGCN-based models in boosting performance and enhancing model transferability.","Gong, Zhaoya","Wang, Chenglong","Chen, Yuting","Liu, Bin","Zhao, Pengjun","Zhou, Zhengzi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE,Heterogeneous graph convolutional networks,spatial interaction,urban land-use modeling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 1 2024,Learning spatial interaction representation with heterogeneous graph convolutional networks for urban land-use inference
Row_5,"This paper explores the relationship between urban spatial configuration and retail location. We present the Contact model to quantify the capacity of diverse urban configurations to foster economic interactions. Employing a network approach, the model simulates potential interactions between residents and retail activities as they move through the city. The model computes the number of shortest paths, weighted by resident density, in a network loaded with retail activities. The method allows for ranking different urban networks based on their potential to stimulate or constrain interactions between inhabitants and retail establishments. The weighted Contact model is tested across various metric radii in a sample of 35 US cities, utilizing population data from US Census Bureau (c2020) and retail data from the ReferenceUSA database (NAICS, c2020). To validate the model, we correlate results with total retail sales data for each city. Our findings reveal that cities with higher weighted Contact values exhibit greater retail sales volume, particularly within smaller radii up to 1000 m. The differences and relevance of this measurement decreases at >1000 m radius showing that the Contact model is relevant at the local level. We conclude that the urban spatial configuration remains to play an important role in the urban economic environment, holding implications for business and service planning, as well as urban planning and design.","Lima, Leonardo","Maraschin, Clarice","Giaccom, Barbara","Giusti, Cecilia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,CITIES,Contact model,Urban spatial configuration,Retail,Spatial interaction,US cities,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 2024,Urban spatial configuration and interactions with retail activities: An approach based on contact
Row_6,"Understanding the spatial interaction among residents, cooling service, and heat risk area in complex urban areas is conducive to developing targeted management. However, traditional urban thermal environment assessments typically relied on simple linear integration of associated indicators, often neglecting the spatial interaction effect. To explore the spatial interaction among the three elements, this study proposes an accessibility -based urban thermal environment assessment framework. Using Zhengzhou, a rapidly urbanizing city, as an example, remotely sensed images from three periods (2010, 2015 and 2020) were applied to extract urban green space (UGS) and hot island area (HIA). An improved two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method and bivariate local Moran's I were employed to explore whether residents' clustering locations are more likely to access cooling service or to be exposed to heat risk. The results demonstrate that the UGS in the city has been expanding, whereas the HIA shrank within the inner city in 2015 and then increased in 2020. Even though the urban thermal environment may have improved in the last decade, the spatial interaction among the residents, cooling service and heat risk area could be exacerbated. Spatial autocorrelation shows an increase in locations that are disadvantageous for resident congregation. Even when sufficient cooling services were provided, residents in these areas could still be exposed to high heat risk. The developed urban thermal environment framework provides a novel insight into the residents' heat risk exposure and cooling service accessibility, and the findings could assist urban planners in targeting the improvement of extra heat exposure risk locations.","Dong, Xinyu","Li, Xiaoya","Ye, Yanmei","Su, Dan","Yang, Runjia","Lausch, Angela",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,GEOGRAPHY AND SUSTAINABILITY,Urban heat island,Urban green space,Accessibility,Remote sensing,Spatial autocorrelation analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2024,Measuring urban thermal environment from accessibility-based perspective: A case study in a populous city
Row_11,"Understanding spatial interactions in urban environments has become critical in the context of spatio-temporal big data. However, Spatial-temporal big data often exhibit non-uniformity, necessitating the imputation of spatial interaction relationships derived from the analysis of such data. Previous studies often used simplified grid-based or TAZ approaches that ignore the complex interactions for spatial interaction imputation, leading to limitations in accuracy. In this paper, we proposed a two-layer spatial interaction imputation framework (SIF) for accurate multi-scale spatial interaction imputation. To our knowledge, this is the first time that we impute spatial interactions in multi-scale urban areas. In the first layer, it utilised a hierarchical spatial units division algorithm inspired by Shannon's information entropy to hierarchically classify study area using point of interest (POI) data; In the second layer, it integrates the classified areas and travel flow data into a spatial interaction graph convolutional network (SI-GCN) for spatial interaction imputation. Two case studies were conducted in Beijing, China and New York City, USA, using over eight million taxi data and one million bike- sharing data. The results showed the superior performance of SIF compared to baseline models. The results also analysed the travel behaviours in both Cities, as well as the impact of social, economic and environmental factors on passengers' spatial choices when travelling.","Xiao, Zeyu","Gong, Shuhui","Wang, Qirui","Di, Heyan","Jing, Changfeng",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION,Spatial interactions imputation,Travel behaviours analysis,Spatial interaction graph convolutional,network (SI-GCN),Hierarchical zoning of regions,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2024,A two-layer graph-convolutional network for spatial interaction imputation from hierarchical functional regions
Row_12,"Street-view imagery has been densely covering cities. They provide a close-up perspective of the urban physical environment, allowing a comprehensive perception and understanding of cities. There has been a significant amount of effort to represent the urban physical environment based on street view imagery, and this representation has been utilized to study the relationships between the physical environment, human dynamics, and socioeconomic environments. However, there are two key challenges in representing the urban physical environment of streets based on street-view images for downstream tasks. First, current research mainly focuses on the proportions of visual elements within the scene, neglecting the spatial adjacency between them. Second, the spatial dependency and spatial interaction between streets have not been adequately accounted for. These limitations hinder the effective representation and understanding of urban streets. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic graph representation framework based on dual spatial semantics. At the intra-street level, we consider the spatial adjacency relationships of visual elements. Our method dynamically parses visual elements within the scene, achieving context-specific representations. At the inter-street level, we construct two spatial weight matrices by integrating the spatial dependency and the spatial interaction relationships. It could account for the hybrid spatial relationships between streets comprehensively, enhancing the model's ability to represent human dynamics and socioeconomic status. Furthermore, aside from these two modules, we also provide a spatial interpretability analysis tool for downstream tasks. A case study of our research framework shows that our method improves vehicle speed and flow estimation by 2.4% and 6.4%, respectively. This not only indicates that street-view imagery provides rich information about urban transportation but also offers a more accurate and reliable data-driven framework for urban studies.

Row_15,"The escalating demand for resources in urban and rural construction development raises the crucial question of achieving green development within limited resource constraints. This study delves into the interplay between environmental policy and green development in urban and rural construction. Utilizing the spatial Durbin model for analysis, findings reveal that investment-oriented environmental regulation significantly impacts green development and positive spillover effects in neighboring regions when considering spatial weight matrices. In contrast, cost-based environmental regulations positively affect green development when spatial interactions are disregarded. However, they exhibit negative effects at the spatial level, potentially leading to a ""pollution relocation"" phenomenon. Although the influence of R& D subsidy-based environmental regulations on green development is not significant, their impact becomes notable upon considering spatial interactions, potentially generating positive effects across regions through mechanisms such as technology diffusion and knowledge transfer. Furthermore, from an endogeneity perspective, the impact of environmental regulatory tools on green development exhibits a time lag effect. Moreover, investment-type regulation in the eastern regions significantly fosters green development, whereas cost-based regulation shows a suppressive effect; investment-type regulation in central regions has a positive spillover on neighboring areas; and R&D subsidies in western regions negatively impact local green development. Moreover, the quality of governmental institutions, market integration, and technological innovation are key factors influencing green development in China's urban and rural construction. This study reveals the direct and indirect effects of various environmental policy tools on green development in urban and rural areas. It emphasizes the importance of considering spatial interactions in implementing environmental policies, providing a theoretical foundation and practical guidance for optimizing environmental policies.","Huang, Yujie","Gan, Jiawu","Liu, Baoliu","Zhao, Kunqian",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,23,,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,Environmental policy,Green development in urban and rural,construction,Spatial durbin model,Technological innovation,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 25 2024,Environmental policy and green development in urban and rural construction: Beggar-thy-neighbor or win-win situation?
Row_18,"Indigeneity in India and globally remains largely tied to rurality, and in urban spaces, as primary (re)negotiations of their urban affiliations, portrayals and experiences. This paper instead introduces a negligent trope of urban indigeneity, particularly as it manifests in often overlooked yet advancing urban spaces within the 'indigenous geographies' of the global south. Focusing on Jharkhand, an eastern state of India with a predominant tribal population, the paper explores cities and towns with strong indigenous character, embracing both their customary associations and contemporary socio-spatial formations. Employing a mixed-method approach, we examine their embedded urban social landscapes through tribal toponyms (landmarks or place names) and evolving urban socio-spatial interactions via demographic concentrations, both as indicators of growing integrations into indigenous urbanscapes. Findings suggest that despite their long-established histories and enduring identities, to a greater or lesser extent, urban tribals are increasingly adapting an outward-pushed urban socio-spatial formation. With shrinking urban cores and shifting social peripheries, indigenous cities and towns are reproducing a socio-spatial dialectic that impedes most urban-led social mobility and perpetuates the precariousness of urban indigeneity.","Kumar, Bipin","Baraik, Vijay Kumar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,HABITAT INTERNATIONAL,Indigenous urbanisation,Urban indigeneity,Indigenous people,Urban toponym,Urban tribals,Jharkhand,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2024,"Indigenous Urbanisation and Urban Indigeneity: Insights of embedded identity and contouring spatiality in Jharkhand, India"
Row_23,"Intercity freight connections have reshaped urban networks and posed significant urban planning challenges. Previous studies mainly used annual statistical data or online orders, which are criticized for the poor timeliness and data representativeness. This study presents a method to construct freight flow networks by analyzing largesample truck trajectories using spatiotemporal and semantic data mining. The spatiotemporal interaction patterns and influencing factors of intercity freight connections in China are then investigated. Key findings include: (1) The proposed method enables multidimensional and dynamic investigations by constructing timely and refined freight flow networks. (2) The network structure and spatial pattern of freight connections in China show monthly stability, significant spatial heterogeneity, symmetry, and a typical scale-free property. (3) Spatial interaction patterns are related to freight transportation scale. High-freight-volume regions form complete and homogeneous networks with activity space expanding, while low-freight-volume regions exhibit heterogeneity with connections focused on core cities. (4) More than 92 % of the socioeconomic factors exhibit significant nonlinear enhancement when interacting with distance. The nonlinear interaction between economic development level and distance is the most influential, explaining 23.7 %-85.7 % of the connection strength.

Row_29,"Spatially explicit population data is critical to investigating human -nature interactions, identifying at -risk populations, and informing sustainable management and policy decisions. Most long-term global population data have three main limitations: 1) they were estimated with simple scaling or trend extrapolation methods which are not able to capture detailed population variation spatially and temporally; 2) the rate of urbanization and the spatial patterns of settlement changes were not fully considered; and 3) the spatial resolution is generally coarse. To address these limitations, we proposed a framework for large-scale spatially explicit downscaling of populations from census data and projecting future population distributions under different Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP) scenarios with the consideration of distinctive changes in urban extent. We downscaled urban and rural population separately and considered urban spatial sprawl in downscaling and projection. Treating urban and rural populations as distinct but interconnected entities, we constructed a random forest model to downscale historical populations and designed a gravity -based population potential model to project future population changes at the grid level. This work built a new capacity for understanding spatially explicit demographic change with a combination of temporal, spatial, and SSP scenario dimensions, paving the way for cross -disciplinary studies on long-term socio-environmental interactions.","Xu, Wenru","Zhou, Yuyu","Taubenbock, Hannes","Stokes, Eleanor C.","Zhu, Zhengyuan","Lai, Feilin","Li, Xuecao","Zhao, Xia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,Gridded population,Population downscaling,Population projections,Urban sprawl,Shared Socioeconomic Pathways,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 1 2024,Spatially explicit downscaling and projection of population in mainland China
Row_32,"The interactive feedback between the transition of urban construction land (UCL) and rural construction land (RCL) lies at the forefront of land use transition (LUT) research, and can shape the intrinsic driving forces for land system sustainable transition and urban-rural integrated development. This study innovatively investigated the interactive feedback between UCL and RCL transition. First, a theoretical analytical framework was proposed. Second, a spatial simultaneous equation model (SSEM) was employed to examine the interactive feedback between UCL and RCL transitions in Jiangsu Province, China, from 2000 to 2020. The main findings were as follows: The interactive feedback between UCL and RCL transitions followed two paths. The first interactive feedback path was driven by the interaction of urban and rural factors, whereas the second was driven by the integrated management of urban and rural land. UCL and RCL transition witnessed a positive interactive feedback relation. Specifically, a 1% increase in UCL transition led to a 0.535% increase in RCL transition, and a 1% increase in RCL transition resulted in a 0.579% increase in UCL transition. The two aspects exhibited complex spatial interaction effects. The UCL transition in the subject city had positive and negative effects on the UCL and RCL transitions of neighboring cities, respectively. The RCL transition had positive effect on the RCL transition in neighboring cities. The key to regulation is to make the mutual feedback pathways unobstructed through innovative policies in terms of both direct and indirect regulation.

In this paper, we constructed three indexes (poverty rate, poverty intensity and poverty depth) using urban subsistence allowance and population data. Then, we obtained the spatial patterns of the relative poverty indexes of Wuhan. At last, Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM) is employed to explore the interaction between urban relative poverty and multidimensional factors. Our findings revealed (1) there are different distributions and spatial patterns for poverty rate, intensity, and depth in the central area of Wuhan. (2) Communities with higher poverty rates are located in high-density residential area with poor natural environment and settlement environment but good transportation environment and living convenience. (3) Poverty intensity was not strongly correlated with any of the factors while most communities with high poverty depth were near urban centers and negatively correlated with location and living convenience.

Row_39,"While existing social and political research has qualitatively discussed the stigmatization of urban villages (UVs), there's a lack of quantitative support. This study innovatively attempts to provide quantitative evidence, employing a spatial perspective for the destigmatization of UVs. We integrated population trajectory, GDP data, employment and residential points of interest, and developed a spatial gravity model to derive the spatial attractiveness index. Concurrently, we selected environmental, spatial structure, and housing economic indicators to construct a regression analysis. Our findings revealed that urban villagers exhibit a preference for shorter daily commutes, underscoring the positive role of UVs in promoting job-housing balance and providing diverse services. The high-frequency mobility of villagers accelerates the categorization of UVs and enhances intra-area circulation. We further discussed the interaction between UV renewal and its destigmatization. To counter spatial stigmatization, enhancing the spatial quality and infrastructure of UVs, as well as promoting diversified land use can reduce the public's stereotypical impressions. Moreover, prioritizing affordable housing and equitable distribution of facilities, along with fostering synergies between urban capital and UVs, can facilitate the destigmatization process. Stigmatization in informal settlements is a widespread issue. Our quantitative approaches, as well as targeted renovation and policy recommendations, can serve as a blueprint for addressing similar challenges in informal settlements globally.","Rui, Jin","Xu, Yuhan","Li, Xiang",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,HABITAT INTERNATIONAL,Destigmatization,Urban villages,Mobility patterns,Job-housing patterns,Spatial attractiveness,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 2024,Destigmatizing urban villages by examining their attractiveness: Quantification evidence from Shenzhen
Row_50,"This paper examines the evolving rural-urban landscape in China's rapid urbanization, contextualized within post-1978 social transitions. Using a socio-spatial analytics approach and mechanism theory, we compare rural- urban land use dynamics (RULD) in Kunshan and Nanhai, located in the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta regions respectively. The study analyzes factors driving RULD changes through actors' practices, attributing differences to globalization timing, land rights consciousness, and resulting path dependencies. These elements have shaped political-commercial alliances and land development norms, leading to inconsistent RULD over time. Two key arguments emerge: First, contemporary RULD divergence stems from socioeconomic transitions, distinct from environmental constraints in agrarian societies. Second, this divergence reflects cross-scale state- market-society interactions at the macro level, while resulting from multi-scale actor negotiations at the micro level.

Row_53,"Traditional urban simulation models often fail to adequately integrate crucial spatial population dynamics with land use, significantly limiting their effectiveness in supporting comprehensive urban spatial optimization. This study addresses this critical gap by developing an innovative model that couple's population-land simulation with macro and micro data for more sustainable urban land planning. Our method employs pre-simulated urban land data and leverages existing population data, while utilizing Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) sub-modules to accurately simulate crucial urban land development decision-making processes, including job location selection, commuting preferences, and choices of residential locations. These sub-modules are adept at reflecting natural limitations and capturing the socio-economic interactions of both working and non-working residents in urban settings. At the macro-scale, the Geographic Micro-process Model (GMP) assesses spatial variations in urban population and land. To optimize population distribution, our model incorporates controls that leverage social networking effects and urban capacity constraints at the micro-scale. Furthermore, by exploring the coupling relationship between urban population and land using the GMP model, our study has predicted population distribution under various land expansion scenarios (Compact, Sprawl and Stable). The application of this model in Wuhan, China, shows good convergence with the Curve Discrepancy Index (CDI), achieving a Pixel-level Precision Value (PPV) of 0.7466 and Elastic Tolerance Index (ETI) values of 0.9109, 0.9061, and 0.8846, with corresponding tolerance coefficients of 0.2, 0.1, and 0.01, demonstrating the overall robustness and reliability of our model.

Row_57,"Vector cellular automata (VCA) models, which excel at representing spatiotemporal dynamics of irregularly shaped land parcels, have been widely employed in land use change simulations. However, current research faces the following issues: (1) most VCA models neglect the spatial heterogeneity of driving factors within each land parcel when evaluating the environmental driving effects; (2) when calculating the neighborhood effects, simple statistics of land use types in neighboring parcels are often used, overlooking the influence of driving factors within neighboring parcels; (3) the ability to explore the interactions between land parcels is often limited. To address the aforementioned issues, this study proposes a HashGAT-VCA model for investigating urban land use changes. The model utilizes a Hash function to encode the non-uniform distribution of each driving factor within each irregularly shaped land parcel into a fixed-length vector, and constructs a graph structure between land parcels based on their spatial topological relationships. By employing a Graph Attention Network (GAT), the model explores the mechanisms of environmental driving effects and inter-parcel interactions to calculate the probability of land use change for each parcel. The proposed HashGAT-VCA model was applied to simulate urban land use changes in Shenzhen, China, from 2009 to 2012. Compared to other VCA models, the HashGAT-VCA demonstrated higher simulation accuracy. The results indicated that HashGAT-VCA can effectively capture the impacts of the heterogeneously distributed driving factors and the interactions between land parcels on land use changes. Additionally, this study simulated land use patterns for the years 2025 and 2030 under ecological control strategies, providing decision support for urban planning.","Guan, Qingfeng","Li, Jianfeng","Zhai, Yaqian","Liang, Xun","Yao, Yao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,Vector Cellular Automata,Graph Attention Network,Hash function,Land use change simulation,Spatial interaction,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,HashGAT-VCA: A vector cellular automata model with hash function and graph attention network for urban land-use change simulation

Row_60,"Urban vegetation in China has changed substantially in recent decades due to rapid urbanization and dramatic climate change. Nevertheless, the spatial differentiation of greenness among major cities of China and its evolution process and drivers are still poorly understood. This study examined the spatial patterns of vegetation greenness across 289 cities in China in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2018 by using spatial autocorrelation analysis on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); then, the influencing factors were analyzed by using the optimal parameters -based geographical detector (OPGD) model and 18 natural and anthropogenic indicators. The findings demonstrated a noticeable rise in the overall greenness of the selected cities during 2000-2018. The cities in northwest China and east China exhibited the rapidest and slowest greening, respectively, among the six sub -regions. A significant positive spatial correlation was detected between the greenness of the 289 cities in different periods, but the correlation strength weakened over time. The hot and very hot spots in southern and eastern China gradually shifted to the southwest. While the spatial pattern of urban greenness in China is primarily influenced by wind speed (WS) and precipitation (PRE), the interaction between PRE and gross domestic product (GDP) has the highest explanatory power. The explanatory power of most natural factors decreased and, conversely, the influence of anthropogenic factors generally increased. These findings emphasize the variations in the influence strength of multiple factors on urban greenness pattern, which should be taken into account to understand and adapt to the changing urban ecosystem.","Jin, Yansong","Wang, Fei","Zong, Quanli","Jin, Kai","Liu, Chunxia","Qin, Peng",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,GEOGRAPHY AND SUSTAINABILITY,Vegetation greenness,Spatial heterogeneity,Influencing factors,Geographical detector,Urban areas,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2024,Spatial patterns and driving forces of urban vegetation greenness in China: A case study comprising 289 cities

Among the key players in these environments, cable bacteria interfere directly with C/N/S/O cycling, and are closely associated with phylogenetically diverse microorganisms in anoxic sediment as an electron conduit to mediate long-distance electron transport from deep -anoxic -layer sulfide to oxic-layer oxygen. Despite their hypothesized importance in blackodorous urban rivers, the spatial distribution patterns and roles of cable bacteria in large-scale polluted urban rivers remain inadequately understood. This study examined the diversity and spatial distribution pattern of cable bacteria in sediment samples from 186 black -odorous urban rivers across China. Results revealed the coexistence of two well -characterized cable bacteria (i.e., Candidatus Electrothrix and Candidatus Electronema), with Candidatus Electrothrix exhibiting a comparatively wider distribution in the polluted urban rivers. Concentrations of DOC, SS, sulfate, nitrate, and heavy metals (e.g., Ni and Cr) were correlated with the cable bacteria diversity, indicating their essential role in biogeochemical cycles. The activation energy of cable bacteria was 0.624 eV, close to the canonical 0.65 eV. Furthermore, cable bacteria were identified as key connectors and module hubs, closely associated with denitrifiers, sulfate -reducing bacteria, methanogens and alkane degraders, highlighting their role as keystone functional lineages in the contaminated urban rivers.

This paper argues that in post-colonial contexts, informality prevails over formality as a stronger feedback mechanism to path dependence. Finally, the paper makes the case for the importance of mapping informal practices within and in relation to formal planning institutional structures for more comprehensive understandings of the role and the impact of spatial planning as a practice.","Rahmouni, Noussayba","Saizen, Izuru",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,CITIES,Historical institutionalism,Institutional informality,Morocco,Postcolonialism,Urban development,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2024,Implication of institutional informality in the historical urban evolution of Morocco: Case studies of Fes and Oujda

This study focuses on typical riverfront spaces in Shanghai, employing an improved Carnegie-AmesStanford-Approach (CASA) model fused with remote sensing spatiotemporal images to simulate vegetation fixed carbon within urban riverfront green spaces. Furthermore, an interpretable machine learning method was utilized to unveil the mechanism driving spatial heterogeneity in carbon sink efficiency. The results reveal the carbon sink efficiency of urban riverfront green spaces exhibits noticeable spatial heterogeneity, varying according to the location, type, scale, and river elements; The internal green component factors, including vegetation coverage and tree green ratio, along with surrounding environmental factor water surface ratio, are key factors influencing the carbon sinks efficiency; Hydrological elements within specific thresholds, namely, water surface ratio ranges between 0.245 and 0.281, can effectively enhance the carbon sink capacity of green spaces.

Row_86,"Building age is crucial for inferring building energy consumption and understanding the interactions between human behavior and urban infrastructure. Limited by the challenges of surveys, some machine learning methods have been utilized to predict and fill in missing building age data using building footprint. However, the existing methods lack explicit modeling of spatial effects and semantic relationships between buildings. To alleviate these challenges, we propose a novel multi-view graph neural network called Building Age Prediction Network (BAPN). The features of spatial autocorrelation, spatial heterogeneity and semantic similarity were extracted and integrated using multiple graph convolutional networks. Inspired by the spatial regime model, a heterogeneityaware graph convolutional network (HGCN) based on spatial grouping is designed to capture the spatial heterogeneity. Systematic experiments on three large-scale building footprint datasets demonstrate that BAPN outperforms existing machine learning and graph learning models, achieving high accuracy ranging from 61% to 80%. Moreover, missing building age data within the Fifth Ring Road of Beijing was filled, validating the feasibility of BAPN.

Row_92,"There are complex interactions among urban spatial elements in rainstorm scenarios. Road interruptions may cause isolation between partially submerged buildings and emergency service facilities, thereby affecting the recovery capability of flooded buildings and the accessibility of emergency service facilities. This study constructed a compound spatial network of urban buildings-roads-emergency service facilities, and analyzed the complex dynamic impacts of time-varying dynamic floods on building risk, road risk, and emergency service accessibility. Firstly, a refined flood risk assessment at the building scale was carried out in combination with flood inundation, building vulnerability, population, vulnerable areas, underground buildings, and life facilities. Secondly, betweenness centrality indicator in complex networks was used to calculate road traffic capacity and collapse threshold, and the accessibility of emergency service facilities is calculated based on road traffic capacity. Finally, the interaction and feedback relationships between the compound spatial network were analyzed. The results show that: (1) Flooded building comprehensive risk analysis reveals that floods have a significant impact on residential and commercial land use, and high-risk flood areas are mainly concentrated in the central region of study area. (2) The road network has a collapse threshold, and the fluctuating state of emergency service accessibility is significantly influenced by road traffic capacity. (3) Roads act as ""bridges"" connecting buildings and emergency service facilities, leading to the redistribution of building flood comprehensive risk and emergency service accessibility, presenting complex dynamic changes over time. Additionally, submerged roads also affect the accessibility of emergency service facilities around flooded buildings, reducing the recovery capacity of flooded buildings, and exhibiting significant heterogeneity characteristics.

This study proposes a new barycenter formula-based multivariate spatial-temporal collaborative relationship model for identifying the complex relationships and interactions among the water footprint (WF), carbon footprint (CF), and gross domestic product (GDP) in the three largest urban agglomerations in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) of China. A nonlinear grey Bernoulli model is then advanced for illustrating the future evolution in WF-CF-GDP and their multivariate collaborative relationship. Results reveal that WF and CF of all urban agglomerations increase continuously, with annual growth rates of 0.59% and 5.63%, respectively. WF, CF, and GDP are significantly positively correlated, and they exhibit similar spatial clustering characteristics and centroid migration directions along the main course of the Yangtze River. Moreover, their multivariate temporal collaborative relationship (0.79) significantly surpasses their spatial (0.63), while the spatial-temporal (0.77) is intermediate. WF has the greatest impact on the binary spatial-temporal collaborative relationship between CF and GDP. In contrast, GDP has the least impact on the relationship between CF and WF. The projected WF, CF, and GDP indicate that the YREB will face more severe water and carbon pressures as its economy grows.

Parks, street greening, and community greens play a significant role in regulating the urban microenvironment, enhancing subjective well-being, and increasing regional attractiveness. Additionally, urban greenbelts have the capacity to control urban sprawl, thereby influencing housing prices and population distribution. However, the exisiting urban models have typically addressed greenbelts and other green spaces in isolation, resulting in fragmented planning strategies. This study aims to establish a novel spatial equilibrium model that accurately assesses the socio-economic effects resulting from the combined impact of various urban green spaces. This model encompasses green infrastructure components and carefully balances their appeal against the consequent rise in housing costs. The proposed model can elucidate the latent synergistic interactions among multiple urban green policies, which enables urban policymakers to access the multifaceted impacts of greening policy combinations. and suggests that combining different urban greening policies can mitigate the negative effects of a single policy type, such as population redistribution. A case study based on empirical data from Shanghai, China, has been employed to identify the additional value associated with diverse urban green spaces. The scenario analysis suggests that combining different urban greening policies can alleviate the negative impacts of urban population relocation. These findings furnish urban planners and policymakers with novel insights to develop the distribution strategy of urban green spaces via judicious policy integration.

However, this aspect remains largely unexplored in current research due to a lack of innovative methodological approaches that effectively capture the complementarities, potentialities, and contestations inherent in the dynamics of peri-urban areas. We contend that peri-urbanisation needs to be reconceptualized as an alternative socio-spatial framework that extends the predominantly Eurocentric discourse on counterurbanisation, making it more inclusive of the emerging urban-rural transformations in the global South.

This study investigates the institutional factors driving urban sprawl in China through a case study of Wuhan, exploring the impact of influential governmental bodies on the spatiotemporal characteristics of urban sprawl as reflected in stringent policy implementations and top -down planning institutions. By employing spatial measurements, statistical analysis, and policy interpretation based on extensive fieldwork data, we observed a marked intensification of leapfrogging urban land expansion accompanied by the encroachment of agricultural land between 1996 and 2014 in Wuhan. These transformations are predominantly attributable to a two-tiered institutional mechanism comprised of central -local and intra-city institutional changes. Temporal shifts in spatial expansion have been heavily influenced by the interplay between central transitional development policies and corresponding local planning responses. The choice of specific locations for land sprawl is governed by the interaction of different government levels, each focusing on local development strategies and land institutional arrangements.

Commercial areas and major public transit interchanges exhibited stronger recovery in mobility after new (sub)variants waves. Train mobility demonstrated robust recovery. Relaxation in April 2022 played a crucial role in increased mobility and reduced negative feelings. This policy shift contributed to a surge in positive emotions, particularly in locations where individuals could engage in social and recreational activities. Moreover, the increased beyond- neighborhood mobility was related to decreased negative emotions during the easing of restrictions.

We combine the strength of spatial lag Tobit and BRT models to examine respective roles of policy and market as well as their intrinsic interactions in facilitating PMF growth. Our analysis reveals that both state promotion of food localization policies and spatial proximity to markets increase the intensity of PMF, and market -driven forces are confirmed to be the preponderant determinant. State investments in city -region vegetable production bases exert moderating effect on market-PMF linkages by alleviating market constraints on greenhouses adoption in remote farming regions, while direct policy effects show heterogeneity with different road accessibility, signaling a complex interplay in the interaction mechanism.

Row_127,"Due to rapid urbanization and globalization, urban functions are increasingly segregated in cities comprising centers of population aggregation and economic activity. Urban development yields intertwining and interdependent functional areas for residence, commerce, and education, which leads to complex but regular population mobility patterns. Population mobility spaces can effectively represent the actual service scopes of urban functions. Therefore, in this study, we propose a function-associated population mobility network (FPMN) to dynamically delineate the service capacities of urban functions, and to quantify the driving effects of urban functions on population mobility under spatial interaction conditions. By integrating the cumulative opportunities of geographic nodes with the potential opportunities reflected by population mobility, k-step function accessibility with population mobility (k-step PFA) is defined in FPMN to characterize the accessibility relationships between geographic nodes and function nodes. Based on k-step PFA, considering the complementarity and intervention opportunities, the function-driven index (FDI) is proposed to quantify the driving effects of urban functions on population mobility. Our experimental results indicated that FPMN could effectively represent the actual service scopes and capabilities of urban functions. Compared with general location-based accessibility indicators, k-step PFA has a higher numerical distribution and less spatial disparity, and it aligns more closely with the actual service scopes of urban functions. In addition, compared with intervening opportunities models, FDI delineates the functional driving effects of population mobility with greater precision, as well as revealing the travel propensity traits of a population relative to various urban functions through propensity parameters.","Liu, Xinrui","Li, Rui","Cai, Jing","Li, Bosen","Li, Yanhao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION,Urban function,Population mobility network,Accessibility,Transferability,Complementarity,Intervention opportunities,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,Quantifying urban function accessibility and its effect on population mobility based on function-associated population mobility network

While initially disruptive, these experiments strive to integrate innovative elements for cohesive urban compositions. Through a musical metaphor, the paper promotes a holistic approach to identifying rhythms influenced and introduced by street experiments. It examines how these rhythms interact, presenting as synchronised dynamics, disruptive discordance, or coexistence in dissonant compositions.

Findings uncover the overly abstract agendas of these experiments - exemplified through narratives involving chairs, railings, and traffic signals - often oversimplify and exclude possibilities. The paper calls for open dialogue to capture power dynamics in street infrastructure and embodied lived experiences during the transition from vehicle-centred to people-oriented streets.

GIs are often planned and designed to reduce runoff and mitigate pollution. However, the influence of GI on groundwater hydrology and that of shallow groundwater on GI performance was seldom considered. This study utilized a calibrated surfacesubsurface hydrological model, i.e., Storm Water Management Model coupled with USGS 's modular hydrologic model (SWMM-MODFLOW) to consider the interaction between GI and groundwater into the process of GI planning. The optimal implementation ratio, aggregation level and upstream-downstream location of bioretention cells (BC, one type of GI) under different planning objectives and hydrogeologic conditions was explored. The consideration of groundwater management exerted a significant impact on the optimal spatial allocation of BCs. The results showed that when groundwater management was more concerned than runoff control, BCs were recommended to be allocated more apart from each other and more upstream in the catchment because more-distributed and upstream BCs can result in lower groundwater table rise which is beneficial. BCs were overall recommended to be allocated in areas of deeper groundwater tables, coarser soils, and flatter topographies. However, the spatial features of BCs are related to each other, the choice of them are affected by various hydrogeologic factors simultaneously. The exact location of BCs should be determined by considering the trade-off between runoff control efficiency and groundwater impact.

The Whitson River watershed is a mixed land-use Precambrian shield watershed located in Northeastern Ontario, Canada in which groundwater is a source of municipal water supply and in which groundwater and surface waters are at risk of potential impacts from urban runoff, ongoing municipal drainage projects, periodic flooding, and climate change. This study used watershed-scale synoptic surveys of stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta H-2) and geochemistry, and corresponding mixing-model approaches (two-component and three-component) to quantify the seasonal and spatial variation in surface water, ambient, and urban groundwater contributions to streamflow. Multiple mixing models were generated based on isotope and geochemical source water identification, and the performance of these models was compared. Mixing-model analyses showed that groundwater contributes a critical, sustaining source to streamflow (> 50 % or more) during summer baseflow conditions, dropping to similar to 15 % in fall when connection to shield lakes and wetlands dominate. Three-component mixing models showed similar results to the two-component models, refining groundwater contributions into ambient and urban groundwater sources. Estimated urban groundwater contributed 30 % or more to summer baseflow, dropping to similar to 4 % in the fall. Baseflow estimates derived from graphical hydrograph separation were similar to mixing model groundwater estimates in the summer but suggest this approach overestimates groundwater contributions during the fall. These results demonstrate the complexity of source water contributions to streamflow and the challenges in their determination in mixed-land-use Precambrian Shield landscapes where communities are largely located.

Row_160,"For next-generation weather and climate numerical models to resolve cities, both higher spatial resolution and subgrid parameterizations of urban canopy-atmosphere processes are required. The key is to better understand intraurban variability and urban-rural differences in atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) dynamics.

To address these aspects, a network of >25 ground-based remote sensing sites was designed for the Berlin region (Germany), considering city form, function, and typical weather conditions. This allows investigation of how different urban densities and human activities impact ABL dynamics. As part of the interdisciplinary European Research Council Grant urbisphere, the network was operated from autumn 2021 to autumn 2022. Here, we provide an overview of the scientific aims, campaign setup, and results from 2 days, highlighting multiscale urban impacts on the atmosphere in combination with high-resolution numerical modeling at 100-m grid spacing. During a spring day, the analyses show systematic upwind-city-downwind effects in ABL heights, largely driven by urban-rural differences in surface heat fluxes. During a heatwave day, ABL height is remarkably deep, yet spatial differences in ABL heights are less pronounced due to regionally dry soil conditions, resulting in similar observed surface heat fluxes. Our modeling results provide further insights into ABL characteristics not resolved by the observation network, highlighting synergies between both approaches. Our data and findings will support modeling to help deliver services to a wider community from citizens to those managing health, energy, transport, land use, and other city infrastructure and operations.

Yet, the integration of these goals has been underexplored. This study investigates the potential for experiential diversity via active travel in different residential contexts within the Gavle city-region, Sweden. Over 15 months, we collected spatiotemporal data from 165 participants, analyzing 4,362 reported experiences and 13,192 GPS-derived travel trajectories. Our analysis uncovered a significant spatial discrepancy: while the travelled distances to locations of positive experiences typically ranged from 1.5 km to 5 km, active travel predominated only within 1.5 km. This discrepancy persisted across urban, suburban, and peripheral contexts. Although residents in different contexts reported the same types of experiences, urban dwellers travelled about 50 % farther for nature experiences compared with other positive experiences, whereas peripheral dwellers travelled twice the distance for urbanicity experiences compared with other positive experiences. Consequently, urban residents mostly relied on active travel for urbanicity experiences and motorised travel for nature experiences, with the reverse trend observed among peripheral dwellers. These results illustrate the importance of spatial scale for promoting diverse positive experiences via active travel, regardless of residential context. Effective planning strategies may include enhancing environmental diversity near homes and developing infrastructure that favours active over motorised travel for short to moderate distances.","Samuelsson, Karl","Brandt, S.

This research aims to reveal hidden socio-spatial characteristics, emphasising variability, concentration, and balance. Space Syntax, widely recognised for its applicability in urban street analysis, has provided multiple quantitative techniques, focusing on the presentation of syntactic maps and average syntactic properties. In contrast, the present research addresses the tendency to report average properties by introducing three statistical distribution indicators (variance, skewness, and kurtosis) to decode six syntactic properties (i_local, i_global, NAIN_local, NAIN_ global, NACH_local, and NACH_ global) derived from axial line and segment analyses. The findings indicate that the statistical distribution analysis effectively characterises the spatial patterns of six of Sydney's ethnic communities, providing valuable insights into socio-cultural organisation, distribution, and interactions in community settings. This advanced understanding of distributed patterns of spatial accessibility and connectedness contributes significantly to spatial planning and intervention efforts in street networks and socio-spatial contexts.","Zhou, Ling","Lee, Ju Hyun","Ostwald, Michael J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,CITIES,Space syntax,Ethnic community,Street network,Statistical distribution,Urban planning,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,"Statistical insights into syntactic properties of Sydney's Chinese ethnic communities: Variability, concentration, and balance"
Row_177,"Extreme flooding events have brought severe damages to cities around the world. In order to reduce the possible effects of flooding in urban areas, spatial planning is increasingly considered to be one of the most feasible solutions. In order to assess the effectiveness of land use management strategies in cities, this study develops an integrated modelling framework for capturing dynamic relationships between land-use change and urban flooding. Taking Taipei City as the study area, an agent-based land-use model that represents the interactions among stakeholders during the migration, planning and development processes is developed to gain greater insights into how planning strategies influence the spatial and temporal dynamics of environmental change in urban areas. A two dimensional dynamic inundation model and a flood-risk assessment model is then constructed and applied to quantify the differences resulting from flood-risk reduction across different planning and rainfall future scenarios. Finally, the relative effectiveness of different land-use strategies is evaluated according to the potential reductions in monetary value of damage. The main purpose of this study is to develop a useful tool for planning decision-makers to effectively evaluate land use flood risk reduction strategies proposed by city governments before actually implemented in the planning process.","Ku, Chia-An",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,CITIES,Integrated modelling assessment,Agent-based modelling,Planning strategies for flood risk reduction,Taipei City,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2024,Evaluating the effects of land-use strategies on future flood risk reduction in urban areas
Row_182,"Waiting time is a critical metric for evaluating the quality of online car-hailing services, with studies indicating a close association between Online Car-hailing waiting time (CWT) and the urban built environment (BE). Points of interest (POI) data is widely utilized to characterize the built environment. However, quantifying the proper combination or spatial relationships between different types of POIs to capture the functional features of the built environment within a region poses a challenge. This paper proposes a framework for analyzing built environment characteristics based on a semantic probabilistic topic model utilizing Latent Dirichlet Allocation, demonstrating that integrating the building area of POIs along with the travel activity intensity at their respective locations enables a more precise identification of regional functions. Moreover, while some studies have explored the correlation between the built environment and waiting time, few have evaluated the nonlinear interactions between them. On this foundation, employing the machine learning technique XGBoost model in conjunction with online car-hailing order data, we probe the relationship between the built environment and waiting time. The research indicates that CWT is comprehensively affected by multiple factors. Taking weekday evening peak period as an example, the CWT of Central-urban area, where has dense commercial and office land use, positively correlated with commercial and office topics, while negatively correlated with educational, residential, leisure and healthcare topics, leading to a longer CWT in the Central-urban. In addition, the interaction between BEs can weakens their individual effects on CWT. A higher degree of job-residence balance can mitigate the negative impact of residential and office topics on increasing CWT, particularly in Intermediate-urban areas. Additionally, BE topics may also suppress the positive effect of road density on reducing CWT. The relationship between the BE and CWT exhibits threshold effects and a V-shaped relationship, indicating that the BE is significantly associated with CWT only within specific ranges. This correlation also exhibits a gradient pattern from the Central-urban to the Sub-urban, especially concerning office and residential topics. These outcomes elucidate the salient ranges of the built environment that exert substantial impacts on waiting time, informing strategic planning for online carhailing dispatch and urban development to augment passenger travel satisfaction.","Lai, Jianhui","Wang, Yanyan","Yang, Yang","Wu, Xiaojie","Zhang, Yue",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS,Built environment topics,Spatial heterogeneity,Job-residence balance,Nonlinear effects,Online Car-hailing waiting time,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2025,Exploring the built environment impacts on Online Car-hailing waiting time: An empirical study in Beijing
Row_186,"The delivery of ecosystem services (ESs), particularly in urban agglomerations, faces substantial threats from impending future climate change and human activity. Assessing ES bundles (ESBs) is critical to understanding the spatial allocation and interactions between multiple ESs. However, dynamic projections of ESBs under various future scenarios are still lacking, and their underlying driving mechanisms have received insufficient attention. This study examined the Beijing -Tianjin -Hebei urban agglomeration and proposed a framework that integrates patch -generating land use simulation into three shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios and clustering analysis to assess spatiotemporal variations in seven ESs and ESBs from 1990 to 2050. The spatial trajectories of ESBs were analyzed to identify fluctuating regions susceptible to SSP scenarios. The results indicated that (1) different scenarios exhibited different loss rates of regulating and supporting services, where the mitigation of degradation was most significant under SSP126. The comprehensive ES value was highest under SSP245. (2) Bundles 1 and 2 (dominated by regulating and supporting services) had the largest total proportion under SSP126 (51.92 %). The largest total proportion of Bundles 4 and 5 occurred under SSP585 (48.96 %), with the highest provisioning services. The SSP126 scenario was projected to have the least ESB fluctuation at the grid scale, while the most occurred under SSP585. (3) Notably, synergies between regulating/supporting services were weaker under SSP126 than under either SSP245 or SSP585, while trade-offs between water yield and non provisioning services were strongest. (4) Forestland and grassland proportions significantly affected carbon sequestration and habitat quality. Climatic factors (precipitation and temperature) acted as the dominant drivers of provisioning services, particularly water yield.

Based on a multimethod research design that combines narrative city walks, participant observations, secondary research, and in-depth interviews, this study takes two older neighborhoods in the Northwest New Territories of Hong Kong as case sites to examine, elaborate on, and envisage the idea of constructing smart neighborhoods through digital placemaking. It finds that neighborhood residents are potentially the most significant actors and hosts of smart spatial attributes. The mechanism emerges through people's diverse and technologically mediated interactions. At the neighborhood scale, the everyday urban smart neighborhood is produced via individuals' socializing and the sharing of information about events. Smart neighborhoods are facilitated and sustained by relatively practical and simple technologies, and their making is more an approach for improving the quality of urban life than a designated goal to achieve. This research concludes that residents' digital placemaking plays a significant role in developing lived smart cities.

To bridge this gap, our study leverages land use data and Points of Interest (POIs) to categorize residential land into distinct types, and further explore the influence of mixed-use residential land and housing types on the spatial distribution of burglary rates. Key findings reveal that: 1) Residential land can be segmented into three distinct categories: pure residential, residential-office, and residential-commercial. 2) While a significant relationship is not observed between residential-office land and burglary, both pure residential and residential-commercial land exhibit a notable increase in burglary occurrences, with the latter exerting the most significant impact. 3) Notably, the commercial environment significantly heightens the attractiveness of high-end commercial housing for burglary, whereas for affordable housing, the commercial environment enhances its deterrent effect against burglary. This dichotomy is attributed to the spatial service scope and target clientele of commercial facilities. The findings furnish a scientific rationale for burglary prevention and control strategies across diverse community types, ultimately contributing to a safer urban environment. Furthermore, the implications of this research are applicable to cities globally grappling with the challenge of managing mixed-use residential land safety in the context of urbanization.","Song, Guangwen","Zheng, Jiaxin","Feng, Jiaxin","Li, Xiaoxue","Zhang, Chunxia","Xiao, Luzi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,CITIES,Residential land,Commercial function,Office function,Housing types,Burglary,Interaction effects,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2025,Unraveling the complex nexus: How residential land with diverse functions shapes the spatial dynamics of urban burglary

The coordination between U_UR and U_WE is crucial for the sustainable development of cities. Hence, a comprehensive evaluation index system was developed to analyze the coupling coordination relationship and spatial effects between the U_UR and U_WE in China, based on the entropy weight method, the coupling coordination degree (CCD) model, and the spatial autocorrelation analysis method. The data was collected from the China Statistical Yearbook (2013-2023), the China Urban Construction Statistical Yearbook (2012-2022), and provincial statistical yearbooks. The results indicated that the overall trend of CCD in China showed an upward trajectory, increasing from 0.44 to 0.55 in 2012 to 0.56-0.66 in 2022. The average values of CCD for 31 provinces rose from 0.51 in 2012 to 0.61 in 2022, with a growth rate of 19.61%. The regional development level of CCD exhibited spatial heterogeneity, characterized by East > North > South > Northeast > Northwest > Southwest. However, the development of the U_WE subsystem lagged behind the U_UR subsystem, and there was a significant spatial imbalance in the CCD between the U_UR subsystem and U_WE subsystem in China from 2012 to 2022.

Row_226,"Urban areas are increasingly vulnerable to sudden flooding disasters caused by intense rainfall and high imperviousness degree, resulting in great economic losses and human casualties. Interactions between rainfall data and urban catchment characteristics highlight the urgent need of accurate and effective precipitation data to apply in reliable hydrological simulations. However, it remains a challenge to obtain accurate rainfall datasets on such small scales in urban areas. As satellite remote sensing is the only method that can achieve global observation, it is important to evaluate satellite precipitation products in their ability to accurately capture intense precipitation on urban flood scales. This study evaluates the performance of the latest version 06B (V06B) Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) in North China Plain, with using the Radar-Gauge merged precipitation estimates as reference data. First, it could be concluded that IMERG fails to accurately estimate precipitation in the whole study area, having the problem of overestimating light precipitation and underestimating heavy precipitation. Second, results show that IMERG has poor ability to capture heavy precipitation on small scales, with the percentage of Hit nearly 0 and the percentage of Miss higher than 40 % for all the precipitation cases. Third, with the expansion of heavy precipitation centers' coverage, the problem of IMERG not to detect heavy precipitation gets mitigated, with the percentage of Miss decreasing by 14 % (19 %). However, the ability to capture both spatial location and precipitation intensity is still not good, the percentage of Hit ranging from 0.05 % to 7 %, without obvious improvement. When IMERG is able to capture the center of strong precipitation, it also tends to overestimate the weak precipitation around the center of strong precipitation. Results of this study provide an improved understanding of how well the V06B IMERG products capture the heavy precipitation center at small scales in urban areas, which will be useful for both developers and users of IMERG.","Xu, Jinyu","Qi, Youcun","Li, Donghuan","Zhao, Zhanfeng",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,Urban areas,Small spatial scales,Hourly precipitation,Heavy precipitation centers,Heavy precipitation centers,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 10 2024,Can IMERG QPE product capture the heavy rain on urban flood scale?
Row_232,"Buildings and roads are the two most basic man-made environments that carry and interconnect human society. Building and road information has important application value in the frontier fields of regional coordinated development, disaster prevention, and auto-driving. Mapping buildings and roads from very high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images has become a hot research topic. However, the existing methods often extract buildings and roads with separate models, ignoring their strong spatial correlation. To fully utilize their complementary relation, we propose a method that simultaneously extracts buildings and roads from remote sensing images. The accuracy of both tasks can be improved using our proposed multitask feature interaction (MFI) and cross-scale feature interaction modules. To be specific, a multitask interaction (MTI) module is proposed to interact information across building extraction and road extraction tasks while preserving the unique information of each task. Furthermore, a cross-scale interaction (CSI) module is designed to automatically learn the optimal reception field for buildings and roads under varied appearances and structures. Compared with existing methods that train individual models for each task separately, the proposed collaborative extraction method can utilize the complementary advantages between buildings and roads and reduce the inference time by half using a single model.

Row_236,"Given that green space patterns and population density often show opposing trends over space, this could lead to trade-off (distance/population decay) relationships. Consequently, this paper utilized the Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) data from Shanghai, China, to investigate whether there is a spatial trade-off in the health effects of green spaces on people 's inactivity. Our findings confirmed the trade-off effects of green spaces in reducing sedentary time, using interaction terms to highlight how the health impacts of green spaces vary across different population densities and may thus lead to inconsistent relationships between green space and health outcomes. Generally, the ability of green spaces to affect sedentary time decreased as population density increases, particularly regarding park proximity and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Our research also revealed that the trade-off in health benefits from green spaces was influenced by the type of green space. For instance, park proximity, park area, and NDVI showed trade-off effects, with higher population densities enhancing the impact of NDVI on increasing sedentary time ( beta = 133.871), despite NDVI itself decreasing with a rise in population density (r =-0.68). Conversely, the Green Vegetation Index (GVI) did not demonstrate such an effect. The unequal spatial distribution and composition of green space may further exacerbate health inequities. Therefore, this paper recommends that future provisioning of green spaces should take into account the local urban spatial structure.","Miao, Siyu","Xiao, Yang",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,Health effect,Green space,Trade-off,Sedentariness,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2024,Exploring the spatial trade-off effects of green space on older people's physical inactivity: Evidence from Shanghai

Row_254,"Accurate detection of changes in buildings is crucial for the understanding of urban development. The growing accessibility of remote sensing imagery has enabled urban scale change detection (CD) in both 2D and 3D. However, existing methods have not yet fully exploited the fusion of feature information in multi-temporal images, resulting in insufficient accuracy in 2D changed regions or in elevation changes. To this end, a Cross-temporal and Spatial Context Learning Network (CSCLNet) aimed at multi-task building CD from dual- temporal optical images is proposed, capturing both 2D and 3D changes simultaneously. It leverages a CNN network to extract multi-layer semantic features. Subsequently, two modules, Cross-temporal Transformer Semantic Enhancement (CTSE) and Multi-layer Feature Fusion (MFF), are developed to refine the feature representations. CTSE enhances temporal information by cross attention of dual-temporal features to enable interactions and MFF fuses multi-layer features and enhances attention to global and local spatial context. Finally, two prediction heads are introduced to separately handle 2D and 3D change prediction, identifying changed building objects and their elevation changes. Experiments conducted with two public datasets, 3DCD and SMARS, show that the CSCLNet achieves state-of-the-art for both 2D and 3D CD tasks. In particular, the change-specific RMSE of elevation changes has been reduced to 4.52 m in real world scenes.

Despite their importance, the interactions between these pollutants in the intricate hydrology and land use of the KCZ remain poorly understood. In this study, we unraveled the transformation mechanisms and sources of nitrogen, sulfate, and carbon using multiple isotopes and the MixSIAR model, following hydrology and surface analyses conducted in spatial modelling with ArcGIS. Our results revealed frequent exchange between groundwater and surface water, as evidenced by the analysis of delta D-H2O and delta O-18-H2O. Nitrification predominantly occurred in surface water, although denitrification also made a minor contribution. Inorganic nitrogen in both groundwater and surface water primarily originated from soil nitrogen (48 % and 49 %, respectively). Sewage and manure were secondary sources of inorganic nitrogen in surface water, accounting for 41 % in urban and 38 % in mining areas. Notably, inorganic sulfur oxidation displayed significant spatial disparities between urban and mining areas, rendering groundwater more susceptible to sulfur pollution compared to surface water. The frequent interchange between groundwater and surface water posed a higher pollution risk to groundwater. Furthermore, the primary sources of CO2 and HCO3- in both groundwater and surface water were water-carbonate reactions and soil respiration. Sulfide oxidation was found to enhance carbonate dissolution, leading to increased CO2 release from carbonate dissolution in the KCZ.

However, the diversity of bacterial size and virulence in bacterial communities has been neglected, leading to limitations and inaccuracies in risk assessment. Surface-subsurface interactions lead to the complexity, variability, and insidiousness of pathogen transmission in the environment. Mountainous landfills are considered as a major source of pathogens in subsurface systems. Although numerous studies have reported the geographic distribution of microbes in landfills, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the impacts on the microbial spatial distribution of bacterial size, which is a key factor affecting microbial migration and risks. In this study, the groundwater, river water, soil and leachate samples were collected inside and around a typical mountainous urban landfill, which is close to a river with a high hydraulic gradient and a strong surface-subsurface interaction. Small-sized (<0.2 mu m) and largesized (>0.2 mu m) bacteria were separated to verify the variability of migration potential and spatial distribution of different sizes of bacteria in groundwater-surface water and soil, investigating the driving factors and accessing the biological risk of different sizes of bacteria. The results revealed notable differences in spatial distribution and driving factors among various bacterial sizes. Small-sized bacterial communities in groundwater and soils exhibited clear trends towards leachate along the water flow direction. In contrast, large-sized bacterial communities remained stable and resembled native bacterial communities. Groundwater hydrodynamics was the main driving force affecting the spatial distribution of small-sized bacteria. The small-sized bacteria showed a higher content of virulence genes which were predominantly expressed for invasion. Thus, small-sized bacteria exhibited a stronger migration potential and a higher biological risk. Due to the surface-subsurface interactions, the bacterial communities in river water were more similar to that in groundwater after rain.

Row_290,"Urban nature is widely known to provide wellbeing benefits to people and communities, but evidence particularly from diverse and disadvantaged contexts suggests that these benefits are not experienced equally by all. This paper unpacks this complexity by focussing on how urban nature is interacted with to produce relational wellbeing on two diverse inner-city housing estates undergoing regeneration in London, UK. We focus on the role of both formal institutions and the perceptions that people form of spatial features and their meanings and functions, and the manner in which these intermediaries shape human-nature interactions and the co-production of nature's wellbeing impact. Our findings from quantitative and qualitative data demonstrate that urban nature contributes to all aspects of a five-dimensional notion of wellbeing. But social housing residents' and young peoples' ability to experience these benefits is limited. Informal mechanisms of social control such as perceptions of ownership of space and its appropriate uses, and fear of conflict and crime limit the extent to which residents access greenspaces and the activities within them. Together with formal institutions such as tenancy types, housing targets and criteria for optimisation of site allocation, they produce hierarchies of use of public greenspaces and reinforce existing divisions between people of different demographic and socio-economic status.

Results showed that the GPUA average NST increased by 0.012 degrees C and 0.053 degrees C in January and July from 2000 to 2020, respectively. In terms of the dynamic correlation between landscape patterns and NST, cropland (CPL) was negative, urban land (UBL) was positive, and the remainder of the landscapes differed in winter and summer. Furthermore, results from the Geodetector showed that UBL embodied a stronger influence in summer than during winter months. This finding helps to explain why the average NST increase is higher in summer than during winter. The Dynamic Q values (DQ) of the area-based landscape metrics were generally larger than those of other spatial configuration metrics, and the interaction results showed that the landscape metrics of various land-cover classifications were enhanced, indicating that the superposition effect among landscape metrics needs to be taken into account in landscape planning in addition to area factors.
