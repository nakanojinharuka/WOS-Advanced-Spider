Row_1,"Urban land use is central to urban planning. With the emergence of urban big data and advances in deep learning methods, several studies have leveraged graph convolutional networks (GCNs) with local functional characteristics from points of interest data and spatial features from flow data to infer urban land use. However, these studies cannot distinguish spatial interaction and spatial dependence in terms of conceptualization and modeling mechanisms and overlook the inadequacy of GCNs in modeling spatial interaction. This study proposes a novel framework-a heterogeneous graph convolutional network (HGCN)-to explicitly account for the spatial demand and supply components embedded in spatial interaction data. Several experiments, including 19 different models and datasets from Shenzhen and London, were conducted to validate the proposed framework and its generalizability within the same and different spatial contexts. The HGCN can distinguish heterogeneous mechanisms in supply- and demand-related modalities of spatial interactions, incorporating both spatial interaction and spatial dependence for urban land-use inference. Empowered by HGCN, we found that spatial interaction features play a distinctively crucial role in urban land-use inference compared to local attributes and spatial dependence features. In addition, our findings highlight the superiority of HGCN-based models in boosting performance and enhancing model transferability.","Gong, Zhaoya","Wang, Chenglong","Chen, Yuting","Liu, Bin","Zhao, Pengjun","Zhou, Zhengzi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE,Heterogeneous graph convolutional networks,spatial interaction,urban land-use modeling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 1 2024,Learning spatial interaction representation with heterogeneous graph convolutional networks for urban land-use inference
Row_11,"Understanding spatial interactions in urban environments has become critical in the context of spatio-temporal big data. However, Spatial-temporal big data often exhibit non-uniformity, necessitating the imputation of spatial interaction relationships derived from the analysis of such data. Previous studies often used simplified grid-based or TAZ approaches that ignore the complex interactions for spatial interaction imputation, leading to limitations in accuracy. In this paper, we proposed a two-layer spatial interaction imputation framework (SIF) for accurate multi-scale spatial interaction imputation. To our knowledge, this is the first time that we impute spatial interactions in multi-scale urban areas. In the first layer, it utilised a hierarchical spatial units division algorithm inspired by Shannon's information entropy to hierarchically classify study area using point of interest (POI) data; In the second layer, it integrates the classified areas and travel flow data into a spatial interaction graph convolutional network (SI-GCN) for spatial interaction imputation. Two case studies were conducted in Beijing, China and New York City, USA, using over eight million taxi data and one million bike- sharing data. The results showed the superior performance of SIF compared to baseline models. The results also analysed the travel behaviours in both Cities, as well as the impact of social, economic and environmental factors on passengers' spatial choices when travelling.","Xiao, Zeyu","Gong, Shuhui","Wang, Qirui","Di, Heyan","Jing, Changfeng",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION,Spatial interactions imputation,Travel behaviours analysis,Spatial interaction graph convolutional,network (SI-GCN),Hierarchical zoning of regions,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2024,A two-layer graph-convolutional network for spatial interaction imputation from hierarchical functional regions
Row_12,"Street-view imagery has been densely covering cities. They provide a close-up perspective of the urban physical environment, allowing a comprehensive perception and understanding of cities. There has been a significant amount of effort to represent the urban physical environment based on street view imagery, and this representation has been utilized to study the relationships between the physical environment, human dynamics, and socioeconomic environments. However, there are two key challenges in representing the urban physical environment of streets based on street-view images for downstream tasks. First, current research mainly focuses on the proportions of visual elements within the scene, neglecting the spatial adjacency between them. Second, the spatial dependency and spatial interaction between streets have not been adequately accounted for. These limitations hinder the effective representation and understanding of urban streets. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic graph representation framework based on dual spatial semantics. At the intra-street level, we consider the spatial adjacency relationships of visual elements. Our method dynamically parses visual elements within the scene, achieving context-specific representations. At the inter-street level, we construct two spatial weight matrices by integrating the spatial dependency and the spatial interaction relationships. It could account for the hybrid spatial relationships between streets comprehensively, enhancing the model's ability to represent human dynamics and socioeconomic status. Furthermore, aside from these two modules, we also provide a spatial interpretability analysis tool for downstream tasks. A case study of our research framework shows that our method improves vehicle speed and flow estimation by 2.4% and 6.4%, respectively. This not only indicates that street-view imagery provides rich information about urban transportation but also offers a more accurate and reliable data-driven framework for urban studies.

Row_53,"Traditional urban simulation models often fail to adequately integrate crucial spatial population dynamics with land use, significantly limiting their effectiveness in supporting comprehensive urban spatial optimization. This study addresses this critical gap by developing an innovative model that couple's population-land simulation with macro and micro data for more sustainable urban land planning. Our method employs pre-simulated urban land data and leverages existing population data, while utilizing Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) sub-modules to accurately simulate crucial urban land development decision-making processes, including job location selection, commuting preferences, and choices of residential locations. These sub-modules are adept at reflecting natural limitations and capturing the socio-economic interactions of both working and non-working residents in urban settings. At the macro-scale, the Geographic Micro-process Model (GMP) assesses spatial variations in urban population and land. To optimize population distribution, our model incorporates controls that leverage social networking effects and urban capacity constraints at the micro-scale. Furthermore, by exploring the coupling relationship between urban population and land using the GMP model, our study has predicted population distribution under various land expansion scenarios (Compact, Sprawl and Stable). The application of this model in Wuhan, China, shows good convergence with the Curve Discrepancy Index (CDI), achieving a Pixel-level Precision Value (PPV) of 0.7466 and Elastic Tolerance Index (ETI) values of 0.9109, 0.9061, and 0.8846, with corresponding tolerance coefficients of 0.2, 0.1, and 0.01, demonstrating the overall robustness and reliability of our model. This research introduces a robust methodology for accurately coupling population and land modeling, positioning it as an indispensable reference for decision-making for sustainable human habitation environments. In the future, this research can be further applied in diverse urban development scenarios, providing a scientific basis for achieving sustainable urban development goals.","Guo, Yunqi","Jiao, Limin","Sun, Yujie","Zhang, Haoran","Liu, Zejin","Xu, Gang",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION,Coupled population-land simulation,ABM,Spatial equilibrium theory,Wuhan,,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 2024,A novel urban population-land coupling simulation model: Integrating spatial equilibrium and macro-micro strategies
Row_59,"Urban rail transit (URT) systems play an evident role in shaping city spatial structures; however, the principles and mechanisms behind this influence are not fully understood. This paper reviews research progress on the coupling relationship between URT and urban space, focusing on big data analysis methods and the timeliness and sequence of coupling effects. It highlights the importance of the temporal dimension in coupling analysis. By thoroughly exploiting data value and extracting key elements, big data technology imparts temporal attributes to these elements, exploring their interaction and influence mechanisms over different time sequences. The paper also discusses the potential application of big data to urban planning to support sustainable urban development. Finally, the paper outlines future research directions, including the deepened application of big data to urban spatial analysis and the role of new data sources in understanding and shaping the coupling relationship between URT and urban space.

Row_86,"Building age is crucial for inferring building energy consumption and understanding the interactions between human behavior and urban infrastructure. Limited by the challenges of surveys, some machine learning methods have been utilized to predict and fill in missing building age data using building footprint. However, the existing methods lack explicit modeling of spatial effects and semantic relationships between buildings. To alleviate these challenges, we propose a novel multi-view graph neural network called Building Age Prediction Network (BAPN). The features of spatial autocorrelation, spatial heterogeneity and semantic similarity were extracted and integrated using multiple graph convolutional networks. Inspired by the spatial regime model, a heterogeneityaware graph convolutional network (HGCN) based on spatial grouping is designed to capture the spatial heterogeneity. Systematic experiments on three large-scale building footprint datasets demonstrate that BAPN outperforms existing machine learning and graph learning models, achieving high accuracy ranging from 61% to 80%. Moreover, missing building age data within the Fifth Ring Road of Beijing was filled, validating the feasibility of BAPN. This research offers new insights for filling the intra-city building age gaps and understanding multiple spatial effects essential for sustainable urban planning.","Wang, Yi","Zhang, Yizhi","Dong, Quanhua","Guo, Hao","Tao, Yingchun","Zhang, Fan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING,Building age prediction,Multi-view graph neural network,Spatial effects modeling,Spatial heterogeneity modeling,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,A multi-view graph neural network for building age prediction
Row_95,"A complex dynamic coupling process exists among water resource consumption, carbon emissions, and economic growth; however, their intricate collaborative mechanisms remain unclear. This study proposes a new barycenter formula-based multivariate spatial-temporal collaborative relationship model for identifying the complex relationships and interactions among the water footprint (WF), carbon footprint (CF), and gross domestic product (GDP) in the three largest urban agglomerations in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) of China. A nonlinear grey Bernoulli model is then advanced for illustrating the future evolution in WF-CF-GDP and their multivariate collaborative relationship. Results reveal that WF and CF of all urban agglomerations increase continuously, with annual growth rates of 0.59% and 5.63%, respectively. WF, CF, and GDP are significantly positively correlated, and they exhibit similar spatial clustering characteristics and centroid migration directions along the main course of the Yangtze River. Moreover, their multivariate temporal collaborative relationship (0.79) significantly surpasses their spatial (0.63), while the spatial-temporal (0.77) is intermediate. WF has the greatest impact on the binary spatial-temporal collaborative relationship between CF and GDP. In contrast, GDP has the least impact on the relationship between CF and WF. The projected WF, CF, and GDP indicate that the YREB will face more severe water and carbon pressures as its economy grows. Their multivariate spatial-temporal collaborative relationships are projected to decrease by 10.26% in 2050. These findings contribute to promoting collaborative and sustainable development of inter-regional socio-economic and ecological environment.","Yan, Pengdong","He, Li","Sun, Tong","Chen, Yizhong","Zhang, Yuanning","Li, Ziheng","He, Mengxi","Wang, Yuxuan","Qiu, Zimeng",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Water footprint,Carbon footprint,Barycenter formula,Multivariate collaborative relationship,nonlinear grey Bernoulli projection,Urban agglomeration,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2024,Water-carbon-economy multivariate spatial-temporal - temporal collaborative relationships and nonlinear projections in urban agglomerations
Row_116,"Urban land use patterns can be more accurately mapped by fusing multimodal data. However, many studies only consider socioeconomic and physical attributes within land parcels, neglecting spatial interaction and uncertainty caused by multimodal data. To address these issues, we constructed a multimodal data fusion model (MDFNet) to extract natural physical, socioeconomic, and spatial connectivity ancillary information from multimodal data. We also established an uncertainty analysis framework based on a generalized additive model and learnable weight module to explain data -driven uncertainty. Shenzhen was chosen as the demonstration area. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method, with a test accuracy of 0.882 and a Kappa of 0.858.

Row_127,"Due to rapid urbanization and globalization, urban functions are increasingly segregated in cities comprising centers of population aggregation and economic activity. Urban development yields intertwining and interdependent functional areas for residence, commerce, and education, which leads to complex but regular population mobility patterns. Population mobility spaces can effectively represent the actual service scopes of urban functions. Therefore, in this study, we propose a function-associated population mobility network (FPMN) to dynamically delineate the service capacities of urban functions, and to quantify the driving effects of urban functions on population mobility under spatial interaction conditions. By integrating the cumulative opportunities of geographic nodes with the potential opportunities reflected by population mobility, k-step function accessibility with population mobility (k-step PFA) is defined in FPMN to characterize the accessibility relationships between geographic nodes and function nodes. Based on k-step PFA, considering the complementarity and intervention opportunities, the function-driven index (FDI) is proposed to quantify the driving effects of urban functions on population mobility. Our experimental results indicated that FPMN could effectively represent the actual service scopes and capabilities of urban functions. Compared with general location-based accessibility indicators, k-step PFA has a higher numerical distribution and less spatial disparity, and it aligns more closely with the actual service scopes of urban functions. In addition, compared with intervening opportunities models, FDI delineates the functional driving effects of population mobility with greater precision, as well as revealing the travel propensity traits of a population relative to various urban functions through propensity parameters.","Liu, Xinrui","Li, Rui","Cai, Jing","Li, Bosen","Li, Yanhao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION,Urban function,Population mobility network,Accessibility,Transferability,Complementarity,Intervention opportunities,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,Quantifying urban function accessibility and its effect on population mobility based on function-associated population mobility network
Row_155,"Groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) interactions are complex phenomena that vary naturally over space and time and are being influenced by environmental change. The Whitson River watershed is a mixed land-use Precambrian shield watershed located in Northeastern Ontario, Canada in which groundwater is a source of municipal water supply and in which groundwater and surface waters are at risk of potential impacts from urban runoff, ongoing municipal drainage projects, periodic flooding, and climate change. This study used watershed-scale synoptic surveys of stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta H-2) and geochemistry, and corresponding mixing-model approaches (two-component and three-component) to quantify the seasonal and spatial variation in surface water, ambient, and urban groundwater contributions to streamflow. Multiple mixing models were generated based on isotope and geochemical source water identification, and the performance of these models was compared. Mixing-model analyses showed that groundwater contributes a critical, sustaining source to streamflow (> 50 % or more) during summer baseflow conditions, dropping to similar to 15 % in fall when connection to shield lakes and wetlands dominate. Three-component mixing models showed similar results to the two-component models, refining groundwater contributions into ambient and urban groundwater sources. Estimated urban groundwater contributed 30 % or more to summer baseflow, dropping to similar to 4 % in the fall. Baseflow estimates derived from graphical hydrograph separation were similar to mixing model groundwater estimates in the summer but suggest this approach overestimates groundwater contributions during the fall. These results demonstrate the complexity of source water contributions to streamflow and the challenges in their determination in mixed-land-use Precambrian Shield landscapes where communities are largely located. Assessment of source water contributions to streamflow across the Whitson River sub-watershed has generated a region-specific conceptualization (e.g. urban versus ambient groundwater) of a basin that is experiencing increased urban development, providing information that will be of value for long term management.","Montgomery, Kimberly","James, April L.","Macrae, Merrin","Tafvizi, Arghavan","Snider, Rebecca","Goel, Pradeep","Zhang, Helen","Yao, Huaxia","Wachowiak, Mark",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Groundwater-surface water interactions,Hydrograph separation,Tracer-based mixing model,Isotope hydrology,Tracer,Chloride,Mixed land-use,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2024,Constraining seasonal and spatial ambient and urban groundwater contributions to streamflow across a mixed land-use regional-scale Precambrian Shield watershed
Row_160,"For next-generation weather and climate numerical models to resolve cities, both higher spatial resolution and subgrid parameterizations of urban canopy-atmosphere processes are required. The key is to better understand intraurban variability and urban-rural differences in atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) dynamics. This includes upwind-downwind effects due to cities' influences on the atmosphere beyond their boundaries. To address these aspects, a network of >25 ground-based remote sensing sites was designed for the Berlin region (Germany), considering city form, function, and typical weather conditions. This allows investigation of how different urban densities and human activities impact ABL dynamics. As part of the interdisciplinary European Research Council Grant urbisphere, the network was operated from autumn 2021 to autumn 2022. Here, we provide an overview of the scientific aims, campaign setup, and results from 2 days, highlighting multiscale urban impacts on the atmosphere in combination with high-resolution numerical modeling at 100-m grid spacing. During a spring day, the analyses show systematic upwind-city-downwind effects in ABL heights, largely driven by urban-rural differences in surface heat fluxes. During a heatwave day, ABL height is remarkably deep, yet spatial differences in ABL heights are less pronounced due to regionally dry soil conditions, resulting in similar observed surface heat fluxes. Our modeling results provide further insights into ABL characteristics not resolved by the observation network, highlighting synergies between both approaches. Our data and findings will support modeling to help deliver services to a wider community from citizens to those managing health, energy, transport, land use, and other city infrastructure and operations. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: A yearlong field campaign with a dense and systematic network of sites provides comprehensive measurements of the atmospheric boundary layer to gain deep knowledge of urban-rural and intraurban variability of surface-atmosphere exchanges. Understanding these is of high relevance for developing next-generation numerical weather prediction and climate models. We showcase the campaign and highlight synergies between ground-based and satellite observations and high-resolution numerical weather prediction modeling on two example days. Our findings show multiscale interactions between city and atmosphere, including urban-induced effects beyond the city's boundaries (""urban plume"") and urban impacts under heatwave conditions. These results are important for developing dynamic modeling frameworks, which will help in delivering services to make cities more resilient.","Fenner, Daniel","Christen, Andreas","Grimmond, Sue","Meier, Fred","Morrison, William","Zeeman, Matthias","Barlow, Janet","Birkmann, Joern","Blunn, Lewis","Chrysoulakis, Nektarios","Clements, Matthew","Glazer, Russell","Hertwig, Denise","Kotthaus, Simone","Koenig, Kai","Looschelders, Dana","Mitraka, Zina","Poursanidis, Dimitris","Tsirantonakis, Dimitris","Bechtel, Benjamin","Benjamin, Kit","Beyrich, Frank","Briegel, Ferdinand","Feigel, Gregor","Gertsen, Carlotta","Iqbal, Nimra","Kittner, Jonas","Lean, Humphrey","Liu, Yiqing","Luo, Zhiwen","McGrory, Megan","Metzger, Swen","Paskin, Matthew","Ravan, Marvin","Ruhtz, Thomas","Saunders, Bethany","Scherer, Dieter","Smith, Stefan Thor","Stretton, Megan","Trachte, Katja","Van Hove, Melania",1,,BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY,Atmosphere-land interaction,Boundary layer,Instrumentation/ sensors,Lidars/Lidar observations,Numerical weather prediction/ forecasting,Urban meteorology,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,urbisphere-Berlin Campaign: Investigating Multiscale Urban Impacts on the Atmospheric Boundary Layer
Row_182,"Waiting time is a critical metric for evaluating the quality of online car-hailing services, with studies indicating a close association between Online Car-hailing waiting time (CWT) and the urban built environment (BE). Points of interest (POI) data is widely utilized to characterize the built environment. However, quantifying the proper combination or spatial relationships between different types of POIs to capture the functional features of the built environment within a region poses a challenge. This paper proposes a framework for analyzing built environment characteristics based on a semantic probabilistic topic model utilizing Latent Dirichlet Allocation, demonstrating that integrating the building area of POIs along with the travel activity intensity at their respective locations enables a more precise identification of regional functions. Moreover, while some studies have explored the correlation between the built environment and waiting time, few have evaluated the nonlinear interactions between them. On this foundation, employing the machine learning technique XGBoost model in conjunction with online car-hailing order data, we probe the relationship between the built environment and waiting time. The research indicates that CWT is comprehensively affected by multiple factors. Taking weekday evening peak period as an example, the CWT of Central-urban area, where has dense commercial and office land use, positively correlated with commercial and office topics, while negatively correlated with educational, residential, leisure and healthcare topics, leading to a longer CWT in the Central-urban. In addition, the interaction between BEs can weakens their individual effects on CWT. A higher degree of job-residence balance can mitigate the negative impact of residential and office topics on increasing CWT, particularly in Intermediate-urban areas. Additionally, BE topics may also suppress the positive effect of road density on reducing CWT. The relationship between the BE and CWT exhibits threshold effects and a V-shaped relationship, indicating that the BE is significantly associated with CWT only within specific ranges. This correlation also exhibits a gradient pattern from the Central-urban to the Sub-urban, especially concerning office and residential topics. These outcomes elucidate the salient ranges of the built environment that exert substantial impacts on waiting time, informing strategic planning for online carhailing dispatch and urban development to augment passenger travel satisfaction.","Lai, Jianhui","Wang, Yanyan","Yang, Yang","Wu, Xiaojie","Zhang, Yue",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS,Built environment topics,Spatial heterogeneity,Job-residence balance,Nonlinear effects,Online Car-hailing waiting time,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2025,Exploring the built environment impacts on Online Car-hailing waiting time: An empirical study in Beijing
Row_232,"Buildings and roads are the two most basic man-made environments that carry and interconnect human society. Building and road information has important application value in the frontier fields of regional coordinated development, disaster prevention, and auto-driving. Mapping buildings and roads from very high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images has become a hot research topic. However, the existing methods often extract buildings and roads with separate models, ignoring their strong spatial correlation. To fully utilize their complementary relation, we propose a method that simultaneously extracts buildings and roads from remote sensing images. The accuracy of both tasks can be improved using our proposed multitask feature interaction (MFI) and cross-scale feature interaction modules. To be specific, a multitask interaction (MTI) module is proposed to interact information across building extraction and road extraction tasks while preserving the unique information of each task. Furthermore, a cross-scale interaction (CSI) module is designed to automatically learn the optimal reception field for buildings and roads under varied appearances and structures. Compared with existing methods that train individual models for each task separately, the proposed collaborative extraction method can utilize the complementary advantages between buildings and roads and reduce the inference time by half using a single model. Experiments on a wide range of urban and rural scenarios show that the proposed algorithm can achieve building-road extraction with outstanding performance and efficiency.","Guo, Haonan","Su, Xin","Wu, Chen","Du, Bo","Zhang, Liangpei",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING,Roads,Buildings,Feature extraction,Task analysis,Data mining,Remote sensing,Correlation,Building extraction,deep learning,multitask learning,road segmentation,,,,,,2024,Building-Road Collaborative Extraction From Remote Sensing Images via Cross-Task and Cross-Scale Interaction
Row_254,"Accurate detection of changes in buildings is crucial for the understanding of urban development. The growing accessibility of remote sensing imagery has enabled urban scale change detection (CD) in both 2D and 3D. However, existing methods have not yet fully exploited the fusion of feature information in multi-temporal images, resulting in insufficient accuracy in 2D changed regions or in elevation changes. To this end, a Cross-temporal and Spatial Context Learning Network (CSCLNet) aimed at multi-task building CD from dual- temporal optical images is proposed, capturing both 2D and 3D changes simultaneously. It leverages a CNN network to extract multi-layer semantic features. Subsequently, two modules, Cross-temporal Transformer Semantic Enhancement (CTSE) and Multi-layer Feature Fusion (MFF), are developed to refine the feature representations. CTSE enhances temporal information by cross attention of dual-temporal features to enable interactions and MFF fuses multi-layer features and enhances attention to global and local spatial context. Finally, two prediction heads are introduced to separately handle 2D and 3D change prediction, identifying changed building objects and their elevation changes. Experiments conducted with two public datasets, 3DCD and SMARS, show that the CSCLNet achieves state-of-the-art for both 2D and 3D CD tasks. In particular, the change-specific RMSE of elevation changes has been reduced to 4.52 m in real world scenes.

Row_275,"The variation in bacterial size and biotoxicity leads to different ecological risks. However, the diversity of bacterial size and virulence in bacterial communities has been neglected, leading to limitations and inaccuracies in risk assessment. Surface-subsurface interactions lead to the complexity, variability, and insidiousness of pathogen transmission in the environment. Mountainous landfills are considered as a major source of pathogens in subsurface systems. Although numerous studies have reported the geographic distribution of microbes in landfills, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the impacts on the microbial spatial distribution of bacterial size, which is a key factor affecting microbial migration and risks. In this study, the groundwater, river water, soil and leachate samples were collected inside and around a typical mountainous urban landfill, which is close to a river with a high hydraulic gradient and a strong surface-subsurface interaction. Small-sized (<0.2 mu m) and largesized (>0.2 mu m) bacteria were separated to verify the variability of migration potential and spatial distribution of different sizes of bacteria in groundwater-surface water and soil, investigating the driving factors and accessing the biological risk of different sizes of bacteria. The results revealed notable differences in spatial distribution and driving factors among various bacterial sizes. Small-sized bacterial communities in groundwater and soils exhibited clear trends towards leachate along the water flow direction. In contrast, large-sized bacterial communities remained stable and resembled native bacterial communities. Groundwater hydrodynamics was the main driving force affecting the spatial distribution of small-sized bacteria. The small-sized bacteria showed a higher content of virulence genes which were predominantly expressed for invasion. Thus, small-sized bacteria exhibited a stronger migration potential and a higher biological risk. Due to the surface-subsurface interactions, the bacterial communities in river water were more similar to that in groundwater after rain.

Previous empirical studies have confirmed that landscape patterns inextricably linked with the thermal environment, but static results based on a single temporal cross section of image data provide only a partial understanding. In this paper, we constructed a dynamic framework using Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) for temperature simulation and Geodetector to study the landscape factors and their interactions that influence near-surface temperature (NST) changes in the Guanzhong Plain Urban Agglomeration (GPUA) between 2000 and 2020. Results showed that the GPUA average NST increased by 0.012 degrees C and 0.053 degrees C in January and July from 2000 to 2020, respectively. In terms of the dynamic correlation between landscape patterns and NST, cropland (CPL) was negative, urban land (UBL) was positive, and the remainder of the landscapes differed in winter and summer. Furthermore, results from the Geodetector showed that UBL embodied a stronger influence in summer than during winter months. This finding helps to explain why the average NST increase is higher in summer than during winter. The Dynamic Q values (DQ) of the area-based landscape metrics were generally larger than those of other spatial configuration metrics, and the interaction results showed that the landscape metrics of various land-cover classifications were enhanced, indicating that the superposition effect among landscape metrics needs to be taken into account in landscape planning in addition to area factors.
