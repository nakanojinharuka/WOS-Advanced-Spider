Row_4,"Due to rapid urbanization and globalization, urban functions are increasingly segregated in cities comprising centers of population aggregation and economic activity. Urban development yields intertwining and interdependent functional areas for residence, commerce, and education, which leads to complex but regular population mobility patterns. Population mobility spaces can effectively represent the actual service scopes of urban functions. Therefore, in this study, we propose a function-associated population mobility network (FPMN) to dynamically delineate the service capacities of urban functions, and to quantify the driving effects of urban functions on population mobility under spatial interaction conditions. By integrating the cumulative opportunities of geographic nodes with the potential opportunities reflected by population mobility, k-step function accessibility with population mobility (k-step PFA) is defined in FPMN to characterize the accessibility relationships between geographic nodes and function nodes. Based on k-step PFA, considering the complementarity and intervention opportunities, the function-driven index (FDI) is proposed to quantify the driving effects of urban functions on population mobility. Our experimental results indicated that FPMN could effectively represent the actual service scopes and capabilities of urban functions. Compared with general location-based accessibility indicators, k-step PFA has a higher numerical distribution and less spatial disparity, and it aligns more closely with the actual service scopes of urban functions. In addition, compared with intervening opportunities models, FDI delineates the functional driving effects of population mobility with greater precision, as well as revealing the travel propensity traits of a population relative to various urban functions through propensity parameters.","Liu, Xinrui","Li, Rui","Cai, Jing","Li, Bosen","Li, Yanhao",,,,,,,,,,0,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION,Urban function,Population mobility network,Accessibility,Transferability,Complementarity,Intervention opportunities,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,Quantifying urban function accessibility and its effect on population mobility based on function-associated population mobility network
Row_9,"The rapid urbanization of large cities poses significant challenges to residents' well-being, particularly regarding mobility patterns, infrastructure, and environmental pollution. While extensive research has explored the societal impacts of urbanization, effectively identifying, and addressing critical urban areas remains a complex task. This study proposes utilizing data-driven urban approaches to guide decision-making for urban planners, architects, and policymakers by identifying key infrastructure areas crucial for improving mobility and sustain- ability. Leveraging open data urban repositories, the study aims to develop a data analytics pipeline to identify urban infrastructure points for enhanced, accessible, sustainable, and healthy mobility. This research focuses on understanding urban factors influencing pedestrian and cyclist movement to promote active behaviors, thus enhancing citizens' health and quality of life. The study hypothesizes that the developed methodology, employing a multi-stage data analysis pipeline and clustering algorithms, effectively evaluates walkability and cyclability in urban environments. Using Barcelona as a case study allows for a comprehensive demonstration of the methodology's potential outcomes without compromising general applicability. The data-driven study explores accessibility and mobility variations, addressing issues of affordability and barriers in new micro-mobility solutions, and contributing valuable insights to informed policymaking for global net-zero transitions.","Sanchez-Sepulveda, Monica V.","Navarro, Joan","Fonseca-Escudero, David","Amo-Filva, Daniel","Antunez-Anea, Felipe",,,,,,,,,,0,,CITIES,Smart cities,Sustainable mobility,Data-driven solutions,Urban planning,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,Exploiting urban data to address real-world challenges: Enhancing urban mobility for environmental and social well-being
Row_15,"Understanding the response of human mobility to disruptive weather events is beneficial for the development of urban risk mitigation and emergency response policies, thus enhancing urban resilience. Most human mobility studies relying on aggregate flow data inevitably neglect the heterogeneity of disaggregate travel patterns with distinctive spatiotemporal characteristics, causing the uncertainty problem for identifying meaningful travel behaviors. Moreover, there is a lack of robust methodological approaches to extracting stable and genuine travel patterns under normal or disruptive situations. To address these issues, this study proposes a data-driven approach to spatiotemporal flow decomposition based on non-negative matrix factorization. With sparseness factored in the decomposition, stable disaggregate travel patterns can be extracted from origin-destination mobility flows. By combining temporal, spatial, and urban functional perspectives, heterogeneous travel behaviors can be analyzed and inferred. With a case study of the Zhengzhou '7.20' heavy rainfall in 2021, the most extreme rainfall ever recorded in China, this study validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach and managed to identify representative and interesting travel patterns and behaviors, facilitating a better understanding of human travel behaviors under external impacts. In practice, this study can provide valuable insights for coping strategies in the face of increasingly frequent disruptive events.","Gong, Zhaoya","Deng, Zhicheng","Tang, Junqing","Zhao, Hongbo","Liu, Zhengying","Zhao, Pengjun",,,,,,,,,1,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE,Human mobility,travel behavior,urban resilience,spatiotemporal flow decomposition,Zhengzhou '7.20' heavy rainfall,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2024,Uncovering human behavioral heterogeneity in urban mobility under the impacts of disruptive weather events
Row_29,"Nowadays, urban planners and decision-makers are confronted with an increasing number of major urban spaces whose functioning is accompanied by a high density of domestic, private and professional activities, all associated with the consumption of fossil fuels and the emission of atmospheric pollutants and greenhouse gases. As centers of activity and zones of economic and demographic resources, urban centers stand out as privileged areas for the implementation of local strategies aiming at reducing air pollutant emissions, whether through spatial planning, the evolution of services or the transformation of practices. In this work, we propose a diagnosis of the links between population, urban forms, mobility and air pollutant emissions, using the OLYMPUS activity-based emission model. The model is run over two distinct French regions, Pays de la Loire and Ile-de-France, characterized by contrasting urban characteristics in terms of structure, density and accessibility. The results highlight the good transposability of the OLYMPUS model over different territories. Then, the interconnections between the specificities of urban systems on one side and the travel demand, modal share, mobility patterns and total road emissions on the other side, are explored. We notably show that the densification of urban centers exerts a pull on peri-urban areas, generating car trips from the suburbs and worsening air quality in the urban cores. The results underline the importance of targeted emission reduction strategies taking into account the unique characteristics and challenges of specific urban landscapes.","Salas, Virna Rivera","Etuman, Arthur Elessa","Coll, Isabelle",,,,,,,,,,,,2,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,Urban form,Emissions modelling,Mobility analysis,Road transport emissions,Residential emissions,Comparative urban analysis,Urban density influence,,,,,,,,,APR 1 2024,"Exploring the linkages between urban form, mobility and emissions with OLYMPUS: A comparative analysis in two French regions"
Row_31,"Micromobility using fully-electric two-wheeled vehicles is increasing in cities worldwide. E-scooters, whether shared or privately-owned, provide short door-to-door trips by facilitating the first/last mile stage of the journey. They are expected to improve livability in cities by reducing harmful emissions and space occupation. In this respect, understanding travel behavior and usage patterns is essential to regulate them appropriately. The purpose of this study is to determine individuals' sociodemographic variables, mobility-related attributes, and latent constructs influencing e-scooter usage. To that end, an individual-level model is estimated to explain the adoption and frequency of use of both shared and private e-scooters based on survey data. The research takes the city of Madrid as a case study, and contributes to a deeper understanding of the differences in the use of privately-owned and shared e-scooters, with a particular focus on the influence of mobility habits and attitudinal variables. The study is complemented with some insights on shared e-scooter usage at the trip-level, which shows the substitution caused on walking trips, and their limited ability to promote modal shifts from the private car.

Row_36,"Ease of mobility within a city is one of the essential aspects of urban planning. Quality of pedestrian mobility is the key to attain liveability and inclusivity in a city. However, the gender lens towards understanding the mobility patterns of women and young girls is largely missing from the urban planning process. Due to this exclusion, the majority of Indian cities are not gender friendly. To address this issue, this study tried to propose a 3 step framework for mitigating gender safety issues while a woman walks in a city. The 3 steps involve identifying the key elements of pedestrian mobility; quantitatively evaluating the qualitative parameters; and visual analysis for validating the major issues. This paper presents a pilot study conducted in the city of Kanpur, India. The research was initiated by conducting focus group discussions among 23 participants to map their typical movement patterns and identify 6 key elements of pedestrian mobility. Subsequently, the study conducted a net promoter score (NPS) survey among 423 participants to gauge the safety perception levels on each of the 6 key elements against 5 deduced qualitative parameters via literature review. NPS is a user satisfaction measurement tool which is based on the user perception used by companies and brands. Since urban safety is largely to do with perception, a NPS metric is employed. Further, the paper employed heatmap analysis and derived 3 critical areas based on gender safety perception to deep dive i.e. accessibility and lighting at sidewalks; lack of lighting at underpass; and absence of street furniture at bus stops. Visual analysis was undertaken to understand and validate the respective safety perceptions. The NPS score and visual analysis helped to generate actionable recommendations to enhance the safety perception of women in the city, especially pertaining to pedestrian mobility.","Yadav, Asmita","Kumari, Rashmi",,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,CITIES,Pedestrian mobility,Gender safety,Inclusive planning and Net Promoter Score,(NPS),,,,,,,,,,,,APR 2024,Gender safety perspective in urban planning: The case of pedestrian mobility in Kanpur city
Row_40,"While existing social and political research has qualitatively discussed the stigmatization of urban villages (UVs), there's a lack of quantitative support. This study innovatively attempts to provide quantitative evidence, employing a spatial perspective for the destigmatization of UVs. We integrated population trajectory, GDP data, employment and residential points of interest, and developed a spatial gravity model to derive the spatial attractiveness index. Concurrently, we selected environmental, spatial structure, and housing economic indicators to construct a regression analysis. Our findings revealed that urban villagers exhibit a preference for shorter daily commutes, underscoring the positive role of UVs in promoting job-housing balance and providing diverse services. The high-frequency mobility of villagers accelerates the categorization of UVs and enhances intra-area circulation. We further discussed the interaction between UV renewal and its destigmatization. To counter spatial stigmatization, enhancing the spatial quality and infrastructure of UVs, as well as promoting diversified land use can reduce the public's stereotypical impressions. Moreover, prioritizing affordable housing and equitable distribution of facilities, along with fostering synergies between urban capital and UVs, can facilitate the destigmatization process. Stigmatization in informal settlements is a widespread issue. Our quantitative approaches, as well as targeted renovation and policy recommendations, can serve as a blueprint for addressing similar challenges in informal settlements globally.","Rui, Jin","Xu, Yuhan","Li, Xiang",,,,,,,,,,,,2,,HABITAT INTERNATIONAL,Destigmatization,Urban villages,Mobility patterns,Job-housing patterns,Spatial attractiveness,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 2024,Destigmatizing urban villages by examining their attractiveness: Quantification evidence from Shenzhen
Row_42,"This study explores the '15 -minute city' concept in Hamilton, New Zealand, focusing on challenges related to car dependency and urban sprawl. Triggered by the greater emphasis on sustainable urban environments following the global pandemic, the research employs a mobility -based approach to assess the model's applicability across various urban districts. Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping is used to identify 'liveable areas' in business, residential, and industrial districts where essential services are accessible within three different thresholds of 5, 10, and 15 min walking distance. This tiered approach offers a detailed view of urban accessibility, highlighting the practicality and varying implementation levels of the 15 -minute city concept across diverse urban areas. Geolocated mobile phone data from 88,660 residents is analysed with a focus on 'inflow' and 'outflow' travel distances at both city and district levels. While the results reveal the practical challenges of implementing the '15 -minute city' paradigm, they also show partial alignment of Hamilton's urban fabric with the paradigm, offering scope for adjustments to better suit the city's specific characteristics and residents' behaviours. The study highlights opportunities for enhancing the diversity and accessibility of amenities and improving public transportation and alternative transport options, all key factors for sustainable urban development. This adaptable methodology serves as a valuable reference for other cities in developing strategies for sustainable living. The study concludes that while Hamilton shows potential for transformation, a nuanced and locally focused approach is crucial. These insights contribute to the current new urbanist literature by providing a comprehensive city -district perspective, extending the discourse to include distances beyond the '15 -minute city' and highlighting areas where further urban planning or intervention is necessary.","Wang, Tianyi","Li, Yan","Chuang, I. -Ting","Qiao, Weijie","Jiang, Jing","Beattie, Lee",,,,,,,,,2,,CITIES,15-Minute-city,Urban structure,Geolocated data,Human mobility analysis,GIS spatial analysis,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 2024,"Evaluating the 15-minute city paradigm across urban districts: A mobility-based approach in Hamilton, New Zealand"
Row_44,"Despite the rising interests in understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of intercity population mobility, few empirical studies have addressed temporal dynamics compared to the predominant focus on spatial distributions. Using the nationwide location-based services datasets in China, we bridge current research gaps by investigating temporal dynamics on mobility network centrality and capturing time-variation patterns of mobility flows across non-holiday period and multiple holidays. Our findings demonstrate varying characteristics in degree, betweenness, and clustering centrality across different periods, alongside an increasing trend of mobility flows on holidays. Moreover, typical time-variation patterns reveal the weekly periodic dynamics of net mobility flows during non-holiday periods, with distinguished peaks emerging on Mondays and Saturdays. Holidays promote significant spatiotemporal fluctuations in net mobility flows, classifying cities into inbound, outbound, and balanced categories based on population mobility directions. Through the determining factor analysis incorporating comprehensive urban attributes and spatial correlations, this study establishes the influencing relationships of urban attributes and period characteristics on intercity mobility flows. Our research reveals both similarities and diversities in intercity mobility across spatiotemporal dimensions, holding applications in proactive management strategies for addressing holiday congestion.","Yu, Weijie","Zhao, De","Hua, Xuedong","Wen, Haosong","Lei, Huiying","Wang, Wei",,,,,,,,,1,,CITIES,Intercity mobility networks,Spatiotemporal dynamics,Time-variation patterns,City classification,Determining factors,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,Spatiotemporal dynamics and determining factors of intercity mobility: A comparison between holidays and non-holidays in China

The research reveals that the population flow during the 2023 Spring Festival travel rush increased both in overall quantity and in the proportion of interprovincial population flow compared to the same period in 2022. The distribution of population movement shows a distinct ""southeast dense, northwest sparse"" pattern, forming a diamond-shaped structure with the Bohai Sea Rim, Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and Sichuan-Chongqing regions as the vertices. Among the most significant inter-city mobility routes are Guangzhou  Foshan, Shenzhen  Dongguan, Shanghai  Suzhou, Xi'an  Xianyang, and Beijing  Langfang, which constitute the five routes with the highest flow volumes, each with its own distinctive patterns and characteristics. Significant agglomeration effects in population movement are observed, with the majority of the 40 cities experiencing higher net inflows situated in the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta regions. On the other hand, many cities in the western and northeastern regions, including some third-tier and even second-tier cities, are facing net population outflows. As the working population and major economic activities increasingly concentrate in large-scale central cities, the future development of prefecture-level cities may gradually diverge.","Zhao, Yangtianzheng","Gao, Ying",,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,CITIES,Population movement,Inter-city mobility,Spatial patterns,Social network analysis,Baidu migration big data,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 2024,Spatial patterns and trends of inter-city population mobility in China-Based on Baidu migration big data

It is vital to ensure urban parks serve the communities equally, particularly during the pandemic and for traditionally disadvantaged groups. This study examined how the COVID-19 pandemic changed urban dwellers ' visitation patterns to urban parks and assessed whether the pandemic exacerbated the inequalities of urban park access among different sociodemographic groups in the U.S. We investigated urban dwellers ' visitation patterns from two aspects (origin and destination) and used a big data approach by integrating mobility data from mobile devices, remote sensing/ geospatial data, socioeconomic data, etc. This study found urban dwellers preferred visiting urban parks that were remoter, larger, greener, less crowded, less noisy, and with less human activities during the pandemic (i.e., 2020 and 2021) vs. pre -pandemic (i.e., 2019). Our results also highlighted that the pandemic exacerbated social inequalities in urban park access. The urban dwellers from block groups with higher percentages of racial/ethnic minorities, higher unemployment and poverty rates, and lower income were more negatively influenced by the pandemic and became less likely to visit urban parks. More importantly, such social inequalities further increased in 2021 compared with the early pandemic period of 2020.","Lu, Junyu","Xiao, Xiao","Huang, Xiao","Chuai, Xiaowei","Li, Zhenlong","Wei, Hanxue","Wang, Sicheng",,,,,,,,0,,CITIES,Social inequalities,Urban green space,Racial/ethnic minorities,COVID-19 pandemic,A big data approach,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2024,Big data insights into urban park use in the pandemic: Changes in visitation patterns and exacerbated social inequalities in the US
Row_69,"The heterogeneous structure of cities generates critical challenges in the definition and implementation of sustainable urban transitions. This difficulty is intensified by an insufficient understanding of how different urban types perform for distinct sustainability dimensions and indicators. In this study, this knowledge gap is investigated in a highly representative Euro-Mediterranean city (Valencia) through: (1) a landscape-based approach leading to the characterization of urban-landscape types via the combination of three geospatial layers, and (2) the assessment of those urban-landscape types with a comprehensive sustainability index deducted from several international, national, and local indices. Results reveal firstly that urban-landscape types can help us identify areas with common morpho-functional patterns that differ from conventional districts or quarters. Secondly, a comparative analysis of these urban-landscape types reveal that they partially display different sustainability profiles and, consequently, might accommodate distinct policies and plans. Thirdly, the incorporation of spatial, metabolic, and mobility dimensions in the proposed index permits addressing transversal issues affecting environmental, social, and economic sustainability. By linking the form and functioning of the city with its sustainability profiles through a landscape-approach, this study is expected to assist planners and policymakers in the design of sustainability transitions adjusted to the specificities of different urban configurations.","Galan, Juanjo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,CITIES,Urban landscape,Sustainability indicators,Urban typologies,Landscape characterization,Urban sustainability assessment,Landscape units,Urban sustainability transitions,,,,,,,,,NOV 2024,Urban typologies and urban sustainability: A comparative and landscape-based study in the city of Valencia
Row_80,"Population ageing and urbanisation requires a more thorough understanding and monitoring of older adult residential mobility trends. Many older adults move to urban areas and previous studies have been carried out on ageing in place in traditional low-rise residential buildings. However, there is little in the literature about the important push and pull factors influencing older adult moves to medium- and high-rise multi-storey residential buildings in urban areas as they age. This case study research considered the housing migration model of push and pull factors used in elderly residential mobility and investigated the older adults' decision-making regarding mobility to age in place in medium- and high-rise multi-storey residential buildings in South East Queensland, Australia. The study revealed how the older adults expressed a desire to age in place in multi-storey residential buildings in urban areas and identified it as an important element of quality of life. Many older adults chose to move house to high density urban areas from low density urban areas between the ages of 65 and 84. The 'pull' factor to significantly influence the decisions of movers was a low maintenance property and lifestyle change from a large suburban home whereas the 'push' factor was upkeep difficulties of the house related to old age.

Understanding farmers' adaptive responses to cope with these challenges is pivotal for informing and implementing effective climate resilience policies. This study utilizes the Spatial Precipitation Index (SPI) to assess rainfall patterns and applies fixed effects methods to analyze extreme rainfall shocks' impact on rural households, using panel data from China's 2006-2015 National Rural Fixed Point Survey. Below are the results. Firstly, both drought and rainstorm shocks negatively affect agricultural yield and income, highlighting farmers' vulnerability to extreme rainfall events. Secondly, farmers respond to these shocks by reallocating labor from agriculture to non-agricultural sectors or migrating to urban areas, with these labor mobility patterns typically being temporary. Thirdly, there's notable heterogeneity linked to household affluence. Less affluent rural households experienced more pronounced declines in yield and income, compelling higher migration rates. Collectively, our findings shed light on how Chinese rural households strategically adjust their labor decisions to respond to extreme rainfall shocks through inter-sectoral and inter -regional labor mobility.","Wang, Heer","Chen, Bo","Shen, Xuhang",,,,,,,,,,,,3,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,Extreme weather,Rural households,Agricultural yields,Labor mobility,Migration,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 25 2024,"Extreme rainfall, farmer vulnerability, and labor mobility-Evidence from rural China"
Row_89,"Urban function detection plays a significant role in urban complex system recognition and smart city construction. The location big data obtained from human activities, which is cohesive with urban functions, provides valuable insights into human mobility patterns. However, as urban functions become highly mixed, existing feature representation structures struggle to explicitly depict the latent human activity features, limiting their applicability for detecting mixed urban functions in a supervised manner. To close the gap, this study analogizes the latent human activity features to the shape, texture, and color semantics of images, with a contrastive learning framework being introduced to extract image -based crowd mobility features for detecting mixed urban functions. Firstly, by translating human activity features into image semantics, a novel feature representation structure termed the Trajectory Temporal Image (TTI) is proposed to explicitly represent human activity features. Secondly, the Vision Transformer (ViT) model is employed to extract image -based semantics in a self -supervised manner. Lastly, based on urban dynamics, a mathematical model is developed to represent mixed urban functions, and the decomposition of mixed urban functions is achieved using the theory of fuzzy sets. A case study is conducted using taxi trajectory data in three cities in China. Experimental results indicate the high discriminability of our proposed method, especially in areas with weak activity intensity, and reveal the relationship between the mixture index and the trip distance.

Row_93,"Shared micro-mobility services (e.g., shared bikes/e-bikes/e-scooters) have the potential to facilitate transport equity by offering available travel modes for transport disadvantaged groups. The achievement of this goal requires disadvantaged people to be able to use and benefit from shared micro-mobility equally compared with others. However, while many studies have explored the equity impact of shared micro-mobility from the perspective of its spatially and socially unequal usage, how its use can help alleviate transport poverty remains unclear. This study provides a more comprehensive picture of the role that shared micro-mobility services play on transport equity by investigating the influential factors of shared micro-mobility use and its impact on perceived transport poverty between different income groups. We developed regression models using data from an online survey conducted in 2022 in three European cities (Malmo, Manchester, and Utrecht). The results suggest that some transport disadvantaged groups (the elderly, females, car non-owners, and suburban residents) used shared micro-mobility less than others in our sample. Shared micro-mobility use shows little potential in promoting the users' accessibility and travel affordability.

Row_100,"Urban commuting flow prediction is crucial for urban planning, transportation optimization, and supply chain management. Traditional models and machine learning solutions often fall short in capturing the complex dynamics of urban mobility, overlooking factors like spatial correlation and human mobility patterns. Recent deep learning advancements have shown promise by integrating spatial correlation through incorporating geographical adjacency. However, this approach may not fully capture spatial correlation, particularly the semantic adjacency effect of zones connected via public transportation lines, such as metro networks-a novel dimension overlooked in prior research. The metro station serves as a major transit hub, attracting passengers from various origins and destinations and correlating the flow between the connected zones and other zones within the metro network. Devising an optimized model to encapsulate these spatial correlations is another crucial area of research where scientists are actively seeking the most effective solutions. We propose a novel sequential hybrid approach leveraging graph-based learning, focusing on the underexplored impact of metro networks on commuting flow prediction. Our model integrates two types of adjacency-geographic and semantic-using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to embed geographic correlations among proximate zones and Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to incorporate semantic adjacency defined by metro line connectivity. Furthermore, our approach innovatively incorporates features directly from online maps, eliminating reliance on third-party resources and enhancing scalability and efficiency. We validate our model using real- world datasets from Montreal, Canada, comprising travel surveys and GPS trajectory types, totaling nearly 900,000 trip records. Through evaluation using established performance metrics such as MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and CPC, we demonstrate significant improvement in predictive accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art models.

This paper focuses on the inclusivity aspects by questioning the adoption of urban proximities: how far planning for urban proximities resonates or conflicts with current residential preferences and practices? Based on functional, social, and sensitive attributes, five latent residential preferences have been identified: spatial proximity, tranquility, elitism, social proximity, and conviviality. These aspirations form the basis for a longitudinal, spatial, and clustering analysis. The results of the analysis, conducted on 2200+ respondents in Geneva, reveal characteristics in residential preferences. Firstly, preferences are stable over time, but malleable to changing circumstances. Secondly, some preferences show clear spatial distribution patterns when regressed with residential location choice. Thirdly, the gap between preferences and actual residential practices varies across morphological attributes. As a main result, the clustering analysis shows that 43 % of the population aspire more to tranquility than to functional proximity; and those aspiring for proximities (32 %) are the youngest and wealthiest. This questions the relevance of models of urban proximities as an inclusive solution - raising issues of generational divide, territorial segregation, and injunctive and targeted planning.","Schultheiss, Marc-Edouard","Pattaroni, Luca","Kaufmann, Vincent",,,,,,,,,,,,0,,CITIES,Residential choice,Residential way of living,Urban proximity,15-minute city,Preference,Inclusive planning,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2024,Planning urban proximities: An empirical analysis of how residential preferences conflict with the urban morphologies and residential practices

We analyse mobile phone locational data from the Auckland Region of New Zealand to connect a user's 'home' location to nearby urban parks, specifically focusing on public housing tenants - a highly vulnerable group at greater risk of health inequalities. We use a number of traditional accessibility measures and four new park utilisation analyses to explore the relationship between accessibility to urban parks, neighbourhood area deprivation, and user's patterns of actual park usage. We develop four new metrics to assist in understanding the actual utilisation of green spaces available to residents: distance between closest park available and visited (DAT), used park opportunities (UPO), locality of park visits (LPV), and nearest park visitation rate (NPVR). We found that neighbourhoods with the most public housing tend to have a lower number of parks accessible, and those that are accessible are smaller in size. Additionally, people living in these areas tend to travel farther to access urban parks compared to areas with no public housing. More deprived neighbourhoods were revealed to have lower accessibility to urban greens in Auckland, highlighting the urgency to address the emerging divisions in accessibility and opportunities for these neighbourhoods. Our findings have important implications for policymakers and urban planners.

Row_117,"Interesting sequential patterns in human movement trajectories can provide valuable knowledge for urban management, planning, and location-based business. Existing methods for mining such patterns, however, tend not to consider the reduced likeliness of trips with increasing travel cost. Consequently, it is difficult to differentiate the patterns emerging from people's specific travel interests from those simply due to travel convenience. To solve this problem, this article presents Geo-SigSPM for mining geographically interesting and statistically significant sequential patterns from trajectories. Here, 'geographically interesting' patterns are those more frequent than their expected frequencies which consider both the travel cost and non-redundancy of any place in the patterns. To achieve this, Geo-SigSPM formulates the expected frequencies of the patterns based on doubly-constrained human mobility models and the frequencies of their subsequences.

Row_123,"The population density in megacities in China gives rise to challenges, such as traffic congestion and soaring housing prices. A trend of leaving primate cities can be observed as well as a population increase in secondary cities. These trends might point to an urbanisation transition from the primate city stage to the secondary city stage. Research is needed to determine at which stage of urbanisation China currently resides, and who are migrating across the different levels of cities in this stage. In order to answer these questions, the current study combines the theory of differential urbanisation and migrant selectivity, and analyses city-level migration patterns and demographic characteristics of migrants across the urban hierarchy. The findings indicate that China is currently in the intermediate primate city stage, where the upward migration across the urban hierarchy is driven by younger adults with higher education and income, and a lower likelihood of marriage or parenthood. Building upon global evidence, this research further extends the theory of differential urbanisation by incorporating migrant selectivity into the interpretation of urbanisation stages. It reveals that educated migrants tend to concentrate and move up the urban hierarchy in the primate city stage but might deconcentrate during the secondary and small city stages. This study offers practical insights for policymakers at the national and city levels to develop population growth plans, adjust targeted migration policies and respond to future urbanisation processes.","Wen, Jun","Jansen, Sylvia J.

Reconstructing the spatiotemporal spread of infections is crucial for effective disease prevention. However, the challenge arose due to limited data from surveys and testing results. As such, we utilized large-scale mobile phone data to estimate daily infections in Beijing from November 2022 to January 2023. Our study demonstrated that an individual's mobility status (staying home or going outside), inferred from long-term mobile phone signaling data, could indicate his or her infection status. Then, the inferred statuses of millions of individuals could be summed to reconstruct the citywide spatiotemporal dynamics of infections. We found that the infection incidence peaked on 21 December, and 80.1 % of population had been infected by 14 January 2023 in Beijing. Furthermore, infection dynamics exhibited significant demographic and spatiotemporal disparities, with urban centers experiencing faster initial increases compared to suburbs. Our work provides a new viewpoint for sensing the epidemic spatiotemporally from residents' mobility patterns in a city when official measures of confirming cases are not available, and our findings facilitate city policymaking in terms of relaxing containment measures.","Yan, Xiaorui","Song, Ci","Pei, Tao","Ge, Erjia","Liu, Le","Wang, Xi","Jiang, Linfeng",,,,,,,,0,,CITIES,Post-zero-COVID,Individual mobility status,Infection dynamics,Mobile phone signaling data,Beijing,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2024,Spatiotemporal infection dynamics: Linking individual movement patterns to infection status

By focusing on the city of Porto as a case study, the influence of localscale land cover evolution on urban biodiversity is investigated, using species richness of birds, reptiles, and amphibians as indicators, within a multimodel inference framework. The results underscore the importance of past land cover and land cover legacy in shaping urban biodiversity. Birds, reptiles, and amphibians respond positively to older vegetation patches but negatively to long-established urban areas. Birds exhibit adaptability by positively responding to recent vegetation, while amphibians tend to avoid newly vegetated zones. The fragmented distribution of amphibians and reptiles in Porto suggests limited mobility and a potential delayed response to habitat loss and isolation. Reptiles benefit from both wooded and herbaceous habitats, emphasizing the importance of local spatial diversity, while water elements are critical for amphibians, although many aquatic habitats in the urban context may not be suitable. Modeling results guide the identification of priority areas for urban biodiversity conservation in Porto, informing decision-makers, urban planners, and conservationists. This spatially explicit research aids efforts to create more ecologically resilient and biodiverse urban environments.

To fill this gap, this research examined the socio-spatial patterns of bus shelters in 20 small- and medium-sized cities in the United States by employing a deep learning-based computer vision analysis with large-scale street-view images. The results revealed a regional difference in the bus shelter scores (range: 30.2-52.1 %). Overall, there are more bus shelters in neighborhoods with higher population densities or higher proportions of minority populations.

Row_139,"Understanding human mobility and trip demand through e-bike trajectories is crucial for urban planning, environmental enhancement, and sustainable development. However, existing studies predominantly focus on shared (e-)bike trips, neglecting private e-bike trips. With the recent availability of sparse trajectory for private e-bikes, we established a novel analysis framework to reveal human mobility and trip demand in Wuhan, China. First, we propose a two-step method for extracting trip behavior from sparse trajectories of private e-bikes, involving the identification of staying areas and the generation of e-bike trips. Second, we establish a spatial random forest method to capture the nonlinear relationship between private e-bike trips and driving factors. Finally, we use the interpretable SHAP method to reveal the driving mechanisms of e-bike trips and explore the impact of various factors on these trips. The results indicate that (1) trip distances of private e-bikes follow a lognormal distribution, with an Adj. R-Square of 0.99, while trip times exhibit a Hill distribution, with an Adj. RSquare of 0.95; (2) Private e-bike trips are not commonly employed to address the first/last mile problem in public transportation and are more frequently used for daily commuting needs, with over 65% of these trips covering distances greater than 1 km or lasting longer than 5 min; (3) private e-bike trips positively correlate with the density of POIs like Hospital, School, and Transportation Station. However, compared to shared (e-)bike trips, Transportation Station Density, especially Metro Station Density, is less important for private e-bike trips; and (4) private e-bike trips are also positively correlated with Congestion Level and House Price, meaning that areas with severe traffic congestion or high housing prices tend to have more private e-bike trips.

Although several studies focused on the gender differences in bike-share systems, only a few include socioeconomic inequalities and the dimension of race. This study considers a multidimensional perspective, relating the urban space characteristics, cycling infrastructure and bike-sharing mobility distribution patterns. We analyzed the data collected from bike-share systems of five major Brazilian cities to investigate the aspects of cycling behavior in terms of gender. Additionally, we examined the uneven access to cycling infrastructure, considering its socio-spatial inequalities. The obtained results confirm the lack of female bike-sharing cyclists at different levels. The gender difference decreased for bike-share trips with longer durations and recreational purposes. In seaside towns, women represented a higher participation percentage in bike-share cycling, particularly in recreational areas such as parks, seafronts, and lakesides. Although cycle lanes reduced the disparity, they did not ensure the gender balance as observed in recreational areas. The proportion of female bike-share cyclists reduced in areas lacking cycle lanes and near metro-rail stations.

Under such variation, groups of regions with high consistency of community affiliation characterize the temporally stable structure of the evolution process, supporting comprehending urban dynamics.

In this study, we introduce the consensus OD network to quantify the consistency of community affiliation among regions. Furthermore, the temporally stable community decomposition method is proposed to identify groups of regions with high internal and low external consistency (named ""stable groups""), where each group consists of temporally stable cores and attaching peripheries. Wuhan taxi data is used to verify our methods. On the hourly time scale, eleven stable groups containing 82.9 % of regions are identified. This high percentage suggests that dynamic communities can be well organized via cores. Moreover, stable groups are spatially closed and more likely to distribute within a single district and separated by water bodies. Cores exhibit higher point of interest (POI) entropy and more healthcare and shopping services than peripheries.

However, existing attempts at learning trajectory representations often encoded trajectory spatial-temporal relationships implicitly, which poses challenges in learning and representing spatiotemporal patterns accurately. Therefore, this paper proposes a joint spatialtemporal graph representation learning method (ST-GraphRL) to formalize structurally-explicit while learnable spatial-temporal dependencies into trajectory representations. The proposed ST-GraphRL consists of three compositions: (i) a weighted directed spatial-temporal graph to explicitly construct mobility interactions over space and time dimensions; (ii) a two-stage joint encoder (i.e., decoupling and fusion), to learn entangled spatialtemporal dependencies by independently decomposing and jointly aggregating features in space and time; (iii) a decoder guides ST-GraphRL to learn mobility regularities and randomness by simulating the spatial-temporal joint distributions of trajectories. Tested on three real-world human mobility datasets, the proposed STGraphRL outperformed all the baseline models in predicting movements' spatial-temporal distributions and preserving trajectory similarity with high spatial-temporal correlations. Furthermore, analyzing spatial-temporal features in latent space, it affirms that the ST-GraphRL can effectively capture underlying mobility patterns.

However, comprehensive studies on emission patterns and decarbonization strategies in these metropolitan areas remain limited. This study presents a novel and portable big data-based workflow for megacities to reveal their spatiotemporal dynamics of road CO2 emissions and quantify decarbonization potentials associated with inter-city travel and the 15-minute city concept. We take Guangzhou City (China) as a case study. Our results reveal that primary purpose trips produce 17 % more CO2 emissions than secondary trips on average. Inter-city trips account for 36.3 % of the total emissions in the city, and those for primary purposes exhibit closer spatial distributions with intra-city trips. While providing more 15-minute-walk POIs exhibits a marginally diminishing effect on reducing trip average emissions, comprehensive implementation of the 15-minute city concept in Guangzhou can reduce up to 56.3 % of the total emissions from non-home-related passenger trips, with variations observed across different trip purposes (40 %-70 %).

This study aims to enhance the accuracy of estimating ground-level fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) concentrations by fusing chemical transport model outputs with empirical observations, estimating exposures using human mobility data, and evaluating the impact of environmental justice. Employing a novel data fusion technique, the study combines the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) outputs and surface PM 2.5 measurements, providing a more accurate estimation of PM 2.5 distribution.

Furthermore, we observed mixed correlations between PM 2.5 concentrations and various demographic and socioeconomic factors, indicating complex exposure patterns across communities. Urban areas, in particular, experience persistent high exposure, while significant correlations in rural areas with EJScreen factors highlight the unique vulnerabilities of these populations to smoke exposure.

While research has described patterns of suburbanization of poverty at regional and neighbourhood levels, there are open questions about how lower -income households have agglomerated in the suburbs in recent history. Is suburban poverty primarily a result of 1) the movement of low-income residents from central to suburban neighbourhoods (e.g., via processes of gentrification and displacement), 2) migration between Census Metropolitan Areas and the immigration of low-income groups to suburbs, or 3) becoming and remaining poor while staying in the suburbs? The objective of this paper is to describe and quantify the propensity of these predominant individual geographic pathways to suburban poverty. We do so via a cluster analysis of census and land use data to define neighbourhoods as either central or suburban, and then link this categorization to a large-scale panel dataset representing 20 % of tax filers in Canada (from 2006 to 2016). These data allow for analyzing different pathways within the context of large Canadian metropolitan areas, specifically to what extent poverty in suburban neighbourhoods stems from intraurban residential mobility, immigration, and becoming poor in -place.

In transformation research, the relevance of social practice theories has been recognized. However, there is still a lack of understanding regarding the conditions under which practices change substantially and what kinds of tools and governance approaches are suitable to foster change in social practices. We therefore propose a novel way to address the transformation of consumption patterns of private households by a) connecting social practice theories to life cycle assessment for a quantitative environmental evaluation of transformation processes and b) using narrative approaches to understand the links between several social practices and conditions for change. An illustrative study of a bottom-up neighbourhood initiative shows how specific meanings and values (expressed, for example, through meanings of ""enough"") affect several social practices from different consumption categories (nutrition, daily mobility, travelling). Environmental assessments further show that changing social practices across consumption categories can substantially decrease environmental pressures from private household consumption, especially in the field of nutrition.

Using AutoNavi population migration big data sets from web crawling, the spatiotemporal structure patterns of intercity travel in China from January 1st to June 30th, 2020 were extracted by using the singular value decomposition (SVD) method. Then the spatial organization patterns of intercity travel networks in China and its five major urban agglomerations were identified by the weighted stochastic block model (WSBM). The results showed that the total volume of intercity travel in China and its five major urban agglomerations experienced a process of rapid decline followed by a slow recovery, presenting a ""Vshaped"" distribution since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Three distinctive intercity travel patterns, namely the stable, holiday, and weekday-weekend intercity trip patterns, were extracted from the spatiotemporal OD matrix of intercity travel. Strong intercity travels were mainly distributed in eastern and central China, forming an intercity travel pattern in which core cities pushed and pulled each other within the national urban agglomerations. However, intercity migration flows were dominated by weak-intensity flows. Intercity trips during the holidays had a phenomenon of ""escaping from the metropolis"". Meanwhile, it had significant spatial proximity and directionality. The daily intercity trips were characterized by a remarkable periodicity with seven days as a repeat. A more interesting finding is that when weekends overlap with holidays, intercity travel on the 1-2 days before the vacations has presented an effect of ""suppression travel"". Furthermore, at the national scale, the stable intercity travel network has formed a polycentric core-periphery structure of ""Three Cores-Six Semiperipheries-Five Peripheries"".

The stochastic approach leverages a generalized version of differential privacy to render an individual's presence at any event plausibly deniable, obstructing re-identification attacks based on spatio-temporal side knowledge. Furthermore, we present a Markov chain-based speed perturbation technique that preserves dynamic patterns while obfuscating travel times and motion attributes. Using simulated re-identification attacks, we analyze privacy gains and contrast them with the utility loss. The results demonstrate a favorable utility-to-privacy ratio of the temporal techniques compared to established spatial and spatiotemporal approaches. This underlines the importance of accounting for temporal aspects in addition to spatial considerations in privacy-preserving trajectory publishing.","Brauer, Anna","Makinen, Ville","Ruotsalainen, Laura","Oksanen, Juha",,,,,,,,,,,0,,COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS,Trajectory,Location privacy,Privacy-preserving publishing,Mobility data,Anonymization,Obfuscation,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2024,Time will not tell: Temporal approaches for privacy-preserving trajectory publishing
Row_224,"Despite the prevalence of wireless connectivity in urban areas around the globe, there remain numerous and diverse situations where connectivity is insufficient or unavailable. To address this, we introduce mobile wireless infrastructure on demand, a system of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that can be rapidly deployed to establish an ad hoc wireless network. This network has the capability of reconfiguring itself dynamically to satisfy and maintain the required quality of communication. The system optimizes the positions of the UAVs and the routing of data flows throughout the network to achieve this Quality of Service (QoS). By these means, task agents using the network simply request a desired QoS, and the system adapts accordingly while allowing them to move freely. We have validated this system both in simulation and in real-world experiments. The results demonstrate that our system effectively offers mobile wireless infrastructure on demand, extending the operational range of task agents and supporting complex mobility patterns, all while ensuring connectivity and being resilient to agent failures.","Calvo-Fullana, Miguel","Gerasimenko, Mikhail","Mox, Daniel","Agorio, Leopoldo","del Castillo, Mariana","Kumar, Vijay","Ribeiro, Alejandro","Bazerque, Juan Andres",,,,,,,0,,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS,Wireless communication,Ad hoc networks,Routing,Quality of service,Urban areas,Robot kinematics,Stochastic processes,Aerial systems: applications,cooperating robots,multirobot systems,networked robots,,,,,2024,A Networked Multiagent System for Mobile Wireless Infrastructure on Demand
Row_229,"Numerous patterns found in urban phenomena, such as air pollution and human mobility, can be characterized as many directed geospatial networks (geo-networks) that represent spreading processes in urban space. These geo-networks can be analyzed from multiple levels, ranging from the macro-level of summarizing all geo-networks, meso-level of comparing or summarizing parts of geo-networks, and micro-level of inspecting individual geo-networks. Most of the existing visualizations cannot support multilevel analysis well. These techniques work by: 1) showing geo-networks separately with multiple maps leads to heavy context switching costs between different maps; 2) summarizing all geo-networks into a single network can lead to the loss of individual information; 3) drawing all geo-networks onto one map might suffer from the visual scalability issue in distinguishing individual geo-networks. In this study, we propose GeoNetverse, a novel visualization technique for analyzing aggregate geo-networks from multiple levels. Inspired by metro maps, GeoNetverse balances the overview and details of the geo-networks by placing the edges shared between geo-networks in a stacked manner. To enhance the visual scalability, GeoNetverse incorporates a level-of-detail rendering, a progressive crossing minimization, and a coloring technique. A set of evaluations was conducted to evaluate GeoNetverse from multiple perspectives.","Deng, Zikun","Chen, Shifu","Xie, Xiao","Sun, Guodao","Xu, Mingliang","Weng, Di","Wu, Yingcai",,,,,,,,1,,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS,Geospatial network,multilevel analysis,information visualization,graph drawing,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2024,Multilevel Visual Analysis of Aggregate Geo-Networks
Row_234,"Food deserts in Chile present a singularity in the context of the Global South. Unlike other countries where food security is mainly achieved through informal trade, in Chile, weekly streets markets is the structural system providing fresh food. Supermarkets complement spatially and functionally street markets. Both systems and their temporal operation makes that the Chilean food deserts main characteristic is their intermittency. The purpose of this research is to analyze the Chilean food deserts to contrast them with the predominant North and Global South discourses and position the Chilean case internationally. Specifically, this article looks to analyze the importance of the spatiotemporal dimension in food access studies where a healthy diet depends on systems other than supermarkets characterized by intermittent operation over week. For this purpose, this article takes the Metropolitan Area of Concepcion as case. First, the research identifies the location and the socioeconomic groups associated with the different degrees of access from a static perspective based on the spatial distribution of supermarkets and street markets. Then, the dynamic analysis introduces the time dimension to reveal the variability of access patterns and the impact on vulnerable groups. The intermittency of the food deserts positions Chile as halfway between the Global South and North models. The particularity of this model is that intermittently and regularly provides a healthy food environment within food deserts. Additionaly, it has the potential to be planned for overcoming structural inequalities in spatial fresh food access.","Zazo-Moratalla, Ana","Orellana-McBride, Alejandro",,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,HABITAT INTERNATIONAL,Food access,Healthy diet,Supermarkets,Street markets,Informality,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2024,Intermittent food deserts.

Row_251,"The restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic have led to significant changes in travel behaviour and public activities, and they might have contributed to changes in residential location choices. However, research examining the relationship between residential location choice and COVID-19 is very limited. To that end, this paper focuses on how pandemic-induced changes in work patterns, travel preferences and daily activity patterns have altered residential preferences and potentially, relocation trends. The main determinants of residential location choice have been established in the literature over the past 30 years: physical attributes of the dwelling; surrounding built environment; affordability; and accessibility to transportation, workplaces, and services. However, each of these determinants are prioritised differently depending on the circumstances. Therefore, exploring how these priorities have shifted after the pandemic can pave the way for understanding how preferences for residential location choice shift as a consequence. From the review, the key findings include the decreasing importance of transport and workplace accessibility in residential location choice after the pandemic. Firstly, teleworking is becoming more prevalent within office jobs than before the pandemic, leading to less frequent trips to conventional workplaces, reducing the need to live within a commutable distance to a workplace. Secondly, trips to other activities have likewise become less frequent due to either remote alternatives (e. g., online shopping) or shifting towards services closer to home, reducing the need to travel in general. Another consequence of the pandemic is people staying at home longer than before, thus increasing the need for more desirable dwelling attributes such as larger house size and wider surrounding green space. Since these attributes are generally more affordable in areas less accessible to transport and services, this may subsequently lead to migrations to areas of lower population density, potentially decentralising urban areas.","Ilham, Mostafa Ayman","Fonzone, Achille","Fountas, Grigorios","Mora, Luca",,,,,,,,,,,5,,CITIES,Residential location choice,Urban decentralisation,Travel behaviour,Activity behaviour,COVID-19,Post -pandemic,Teleworking,,,,,,,,,AUG 2024,To move or not to move: A review of residential relocation trends after COVID-19
Row_254,"Ethnoracial segregation persists as a pressing issue in American cities. Understanding these issues is crucial for promoting social equity and justice, and planning more inclusive cities. Prior research has predominantly emphasized residential ethnoracial diversity but has often overlooked or inadequately addressed ethnoracial diversity and segregation in individuals' daily activities and places they visit, due in part to data limitations. This study leverages a dynamic measure of ethnoracial diversity and dominance at the finest spatial scale, specifically at the Points of Interest (POI) level and various temporal contexts. Using one month of privacy-enhanced mobile phone location data in Los Angeles County, California, this study explores ethnoracial diversity and spatial segregation simultaneously in POI visits in LA County. Our findings confirm that individuals' daily mobility in urban areas enhances ethnoracial mixing at activity locations. Empirical results indicate that the diversity of visitors to a POI is significantly higher than the neighborhood diversity where the same POI is located. A significant positive linear relationship was found between the neighborhood diversity of POIs and the diversity of visitors. About 34 % of the variance in the diversity of visitors to POIs can be explained by the neighborhood diversity of POIs. Our results also suggest significant spatial clusters of isolated/integrated areas regarding ethnoracial mixing in people's daily activity locations. Notably, the Hispanic or Latino population tends to stay in their own communities and experiences a higher level of segregation in their daily activity locations. The findings have significant implications for urban planners and policymakers to design targeted solutions and policies to promote social equity, integration, and equal access to public amenities and opportunities in urban spaces.","Su, Rongxiang","Newsham, Niall","Dodge, Somayeh",,,,,,,,,,,,0,,COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS,Ethnoracial diversity,Segregation,Point of interest,Mobile phone data,Human activities,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,Spatiotemporal dynamics of ethnoracial diversity and segregation in Los Angeles County: Insights from mobile phone data
Row_266,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have been shown to effectively mitigate the detrimental effects of heavy metal stress on their plant hosts. Nevertheless, the biological activities of AMF were concurrently compromised. Biochar (BC), as an abiotic factor, had the potential compensate for this limitation. To elucidate the synergistic effects of biotic and abiotic factors, a pot experiment was conducted to assess the impact of biochar and AMF on the growth, physiological traits, and genetic expression in rice plants subjected to Cd stress. The results demonstrated that biochar significantly increased the mycorrhizal colonization rate by 22.19 %, while the combined application of biochar and AMF led to a remarkable enhancement of rice root biomass by 42.2 %. This resulted in a shift in spatial growth patterns that preferentially promoted enhanced underground development. Biochar effectively mitigated the stomatal limitations imposed by Cd on photosynthetic processes. The decrease in IBRv2 (Integrated Biomarker Response version 2) values suggested that the antioxidant system was experiencing a state of remission. An increase of Cd content within the rice root systems was observed, ranging from 33.71 % to 48.71 %, accompanied by a reduction in Cd bioavailability and mobility curtailed its translocation to the aboveground tissues. Under conditions of low soil Cd concentration (Cd <= 1 mg center dot kg 1 ), the Cd content in rice seeds from the group subjected to the combined treatment remained below the national standard (Cd <= 0.2 mg center dot kg 1 ). Furthermore, the combined treatment modulated the uptake of Fe and Zn by rice, while simultaneously suppressing the expression of genes associated with Cd transport. Collectively, the integration of biological and abiotic factors provided a novel perspective and methodological framework for safe in-situ utilization of soils with low Cd contamination.","Zhao, Ting","Wang, Li","Yang, Jixian",,,,,,,,,,,,2,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,Straw biochar,Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi,Cadmium polluted soil,Rhizosphere fixation,Bioavailability,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 15 2024,Synergistic effects of combined application of biochar and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on the safe production of rice in cadmium contaminated soil
Row_272,"Previous studies regarding e-scooter sharing mainly focused on analyzing the risk factors and the socioeconomic characteristics of users. Moreover, these studies had limitations, such as the small amount of data for policy implications and the restricted geographic scope centered on western countries with minimal attention on Asian urban areas. To overcome such limitations, this research has aimed to identify clearer features of behavioral aspects of e-scooter sharing by utilizing credit card big data and conducting a mobile survey amongst users in Seoul including various time slots during the COVID-19 outbreak. The findings revealed two peak times for escooter sharing during the week with heightened activity on weekends and holidays. It was noted that e-scooter sharing substituted other modes of transportation from midnight to 05:00. The majority of users were men and young people, driven primarily by the motivation for leisure and fun. High levels of patronage and customer satisfaction were identified, but there was a need for fundamental facilities to support sustained usage. Although the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on e-scooter sharing usage, quantifying its extent has proven to be challenging. Weather conditions also influenced usage patterns, which varied across different regions. E-scooter sharing was used both as a complement and substitute for traditional transportation modes depending on specific situations. It was concluded that e-scooter sharing was not viewed as a replacement for cars, but often used to connect with mass transit. Consequently, the sustainability of its services remains a subject of debate.","Lee, Changju","Kaack, Simon","Lee, Sunghoon",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,E -scooter sharing,Shared mobility,Traveler behavior,Credit card big data,Mobile survey,COVID-19,,,,,,,,,,JAN 20 2024,"Different mode, different travel?

Row_279,"Dockless bike-sharing (DBS) system provides a convenient and flexible travel mode and is believed to be an essential means to improve travel efficiency and promote sustainable urban mobility. Despite an increasing body of scholarship on this issue, the spatial and temporal disparities of the relationship between built environment and DBS usage are less discussed in existing literature. In particular, few studies have taken the coexistence of complementary and competitive relation between bike-sharing and existing transit systems into account. Using 250 m grid level data in Shenzhen, this study applied multi-scale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) to reveal the local effects of built environment on bike utilization. The results found that population and employment density are generally positively related to bike usage. A significant competitive effect on DBS is observed in areas with dense metro stations, while complementary effect is found in other areas. In addition, bus coverage is found to negatively affect bike usage, meaning that public bus would substitute bike-sharing to travel. Mixed land use can attract bike usage on weekday but not on weekend, while residential as well as commercial areas have the potential to generate more bike demand in urban center and inner suburbs but not in exurban areas. Conversely, industrial areas in suburbs contribute to bike usage. Furthermore, office building plays a critical and positive role in bike usage, especially in suburbs, whereas restaurant shows negative effects during peak times. This research sheds light on the relationships between built environment and travel behavior, and the findings can provide tailor-made policies towards cycling-friendly environment and sustainable transportation.","Zhou, Junhong","Lai, Yani","Tu, Wei","Wu, Yuzhe",,,,,,,,,,,0,,CITIES,Dockless bike-sharing,Built environment,Travel behavior,Multi-scale geographically weighted regression,Spatiotemporal heterogeneity,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,"Exploring the relationship between built environment and spatiotemporal heterogeneity of dockless bike-sharing usage: A case study of Shenzhen, China"
Row_289,"Traffic flow prediction in spatio-temporal networks is a crucial aspect of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Existing traffic flow forecasting methods, particularly those utilizing graph neural networks, encounter limitations. When processing large-scale graph data, the depth of these models can restrict their ability to effectively capture complex relationships and patterns. Additionally, these methods often focus mainly on local neighborhood information, which can limit their capability to recognize and analyze global relationships and patterns within the graph data. Therefore, we proposed a deep knowledge distillation model, tailored to effectively capture spatio-temporal patterns in traffic flow prediction. This model incorporates a bidirectional random walk process on a directed graph, enabling it to effectively capture both spatial and temporal dependencies. Utilizing a blend of mutual learning and self -distillation, our approach enhances the detection of spatio-temporal relationships within traffic data and improves the feature perception ability at both local and global levels. We tested our model on two real -world datasets, achieving notable improvements in prediction accuracy, especially for predictions within a one -hour timeframe. In comparison to the baseline model, our proposed model achieved accuracy improvements of 0.19 and 0.18 on the respective datasets. These results highlight the success of using mutual learning and self -distillation to transfer knowledge effectively within and between models and to improve the model's capability in identifying and extracting features.","Li, Ying","Li, Ping","Yan, Doudou","Liu, Yang","Liu, Zhiyuan",,,,,,,,,,5,,EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS,Traffic prediction,Spatio-temporal characteristics,Graph neural network,Knowledge distillation,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 15 2024,Deep knowledge distillation: A self-mutual learning framework for traffic prediction
Row_294,"Exposure to nature is increasingly regarded as a key part of human health, and the recognition that urban environments must provide access to green spaces for the wellbeing. The beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to many governments issuing stay-at-home orders and closing parks, limiting the options of accessible green spaces for people seeking to safely socialise and cope with stress. Here, we gain a global perspective on how quickly people returned to nature (visiting parks and beaches) in comparison to necessities (accessing groceries and pharmaceuticals) and luxury activities (retail purchases and recreation) following COVID-19 lockdowns using Google Mobility data. We found that people from around the world returned to nature 76 days after peak lockdown, 28 days after people returned to necessities and 77 days before the return to luxuries. Central Asia, Europe, and Northern America returned to nature before necessities. These patterns held even after seasonally-detrending the data. We further found a strong negative correlation between the speed people pulsed back to nature and the strength of government response measures. Combined, our data support the value of nature to people and the need to consider access to green and natural space for human well-being. At the same time, the large-scale return to nature also highlighted the need to promote messages on how to minimise the impacts of human activities in these spaces.

Row_320,"Shared e-scooters are considered a sustainable urban travel solution, yet their environmental impact is notable, primarily due to a short lifespan and the use of Li-ion batteries. The objective of this paper is to explore the possible factors with an influence on e-scooter energy consumption. These influential factors include trip and rider attributes, built environment characteristics, road geometry, surface materials, light and meteorological conditions. This study empirically investigates factors influencing e-scooter battery energy consumption, utilizing real usage data from GPS-equipped free-floating e-scooters in four European cities at the individual trip level. GPS positions allowed for the specification of local road characteristics and ambient conditions. For this purpose Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, Open Street Maps and the Meteostat application were used. Energy consumption was explained with the use of linear regression models as a function of those parameters, while controlling user experience and battery usage intensity. An extensive dataset covering over 150,000 trips in Bordeaux, Hamburg, Malaga, and Paris and two months of observations was used to estimate the models. Results indicate that, while travel distance is the most influential factor, other usage aspects play a role. Cold weather, rain, wind, as well as stone-paved streets increase energy consumption. In addition there seems to be a battery age threshold beyond which energy consumption rises.","Gioldasis, Christos","Christoforou, Zoi","Katsiadrami, Aikaterini",,,,,,,,,,,,2,,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,e-scooter,Micromobility,Li-ion batteries,Energy consumption,,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 1 2024,Usage factors influencing e-scooter energy consumption: An empirical investigation
