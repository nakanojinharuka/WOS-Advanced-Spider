Row_4,"In an urbanized world, the challenges posed by climate change need to be met through innovative planning for cities and regions. Urban resilience demands that cities adopt new models centered on carbon neutrality, ecosystem services and biodiversity enhancement, circularity, and social inclusion. In light of the multiple interdependencies of metropolitan systems and the natural and territorial potentialities present on their fringes, this paper discusses the metropolitan fringes as strategic for urban resilience and sustainable transitions. By combining a mixed-method analysis of adaptation and urban plans with semi-structured interviews performed with key technicians, the analysis is focused on an inter-municipal fringe zone within the Barcelona Metropolitan Area - the Bes`os territory. Aiming to contribute to the discussions related to Territorial innovation for cities and regions, the paper offers a multi-scale perspective and illustrates innovative urban transformation strategies across scales. The results highlight that governance and multiple planning and participation instances together with technical and financial support are essential for consensus building in an incremental process. Furthermore, the planning strategies of the case study sought to integrate and enhance the green and blue infrastructures and transform consolidated urban areas with a focus on energy transition, sustainable mobility, circularity, and social inclusion. In conclusion, it is argued that resilience has a multi-scalar perspective within the metropolitan context and should be integrated with planning policies at different scales from a coordinated vision. Although adaptation and urban projects have a critical local element, a broader and more strategic vision is necessary, especially in metropolitan fringe areas.","Marques, Andresa Ledo","Alvim, Angelica Tanus Benatti",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,CITIES,Metropolitan fringes,Urban resilience,Metropolitan resilience,Metropolitan planning,Multi-scale planning,Barcelona Metropolitan Area,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2024,Metropolitan fringes as strategic areas for urban resilience and sustainable transitions: Insights from Barcelona Metropolitan Area
Row_9,"The suburbanization of poverty has been a concerning trend in many urban regions. While research has described patterns of suburbanization of poverty at regional and neighbourhood levels, there are open questions about how lower -income households have agglomerated in the suburbs in recent history. Is suburban poverty primarily a result of 1) the movement of low-income residents from central to suburban neighbourhoods (e.g., via processes of gentrification and displacement), 2) migration between Census Metropolitan Areas and the immigration of low-income groups to suburbs, or 3) becoming and remaining poor while staying in the suburbs? The objective of this paper is to describe and quantify the propensity of these predominant individual geographic pathways to suburban poverty. We do so via a cluster analysis of census and land use data to define neighbourhoods as either central or suburban, and then link this categorization to a large-scale panel dataset representing 20 % of tax filers in Canada (from 2006 to 2016). These data allow for analyzing different pathways within the context of large Canadian metropolitan areas, specifically to what extent poverty in suburban neighbourhoods stems from intraurban residential mobility, immigration, and becoming poor in -place. We find that becoming and remaining poor while staying in the suburbs encompasses a greater proportion of suburban poverty than immigration and centreto -suburb residential mobility combined. Overall, this research expands our understanding of the sources of suburban poverty while also providing pertinent information to aid preventative policy aimed at reducing suburban poverty in Canada.","Allen, Jeff","Farber, Steven","Tiznado-Aitken, Ignacio",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,CITIES,Suburbs,Poverty,Residential mobility,Immigration,Panel data,,,,,,,,,,,APR 2024,Pathways to suburban poverty in nine Canadian metropolitan areas
Row_16,"This research investigates whether gentrification restricts housing markets for low-income households by focussing on the New York and San Francisco metropolitan areas from 2013 to 2019. We investigate whether gentrification correlates with increased out-migration and decreased in-migration of low-income residents in affected neighbourhoods, and how it shapes where out-movers relocate. We leverage a unique longitudinal dataset to compare two extreme regional contexts characterised by significant affordability challenges and intense housing regulations. By doing so, this study aims to provide a more refined understanding of gentrification and residential mobility dynamics, avoiding broad generalisations or a narrow focus on single metropolitan contexts. The findings indicate that in both regions, low-income households are indeed more likely to leave gentrifying neighbourhoods compared to non-gentrifying ones and less likely to enter them compared to higher-income households. The study also finds mixed results regarding the subsequent residential situations of these low-income movers. Based on these findings, we provide implications for research and policies oriented towards improving housing and neighbourhood access for low-income households in rapidly changing urban areas.","Song, Taesoo","Chapple, Karen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,URBAN STUDIES,gentrification,neighbourhood access,neighbourhood change,residential mobility,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,Does gentrification constrain housing markets for low-income households?

Row_44,"The neighborhood effect averaging problem (NEAP) is a fundamental statistical phenomenon in mobility-dependent environmental exposures. It suggests that individual environmental exposures tend toward the average exposure in the study area when considering human mobility. However, the universality of the NEAP across various environmental exposures and the mechanisms underlying its occurrence remain unclear. Here, using a large human mobility data set of more than 27 000 individuals in the Chicago Metropolitan Area, we provide robust evidence of the existence of the NEAP in a range of individual environmental exposures, including green spaces, air pollution, healthy food environments, transit accessibility, and crime rates. We also unveil the social and spatial disparities in the NEAP's influence on individual environmental exposure estimates. To further reveal the mechanisms behind the NEAP, we perform multiscenario analyses based on environmental variation and human mobility simulations. The results reveal that the NEAP is a statistical phenomenon of regression to the mean (RTM) under the constraints of spatial autocorrelation in environmental data. Increasing travel distances and out-of-home durations can intensify and promote the NEAP's impact, particularly for highly dynamic environmental factors like air pollution. These findings illuminate the complex interplay between human mobility and environmental factors, guiding more effective public health interventions.","Cai, Jiannan","Kwan, Mei-Po",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,environmental exposures,human mobility,neighborhoodeffect averaging problem,spatial autocorrelation,multiscenario simulation,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 3 2024,The Universal Neighborhood Effect Averaging in Mobility-Dependent Environmental Exposures
Row_46,"The term ""housing ladder"" refers to the phenomenon of people moving from one housing type to another according to changing demands of different life stages. This phenomenon is observed in many countries and is known as the Jutaku Sugoroku Paradigm in the Japanese context. This study aims to clarify whether adult children's access to homeownership might be affected by their parents' homeownership and their place of origin. Questionnaire Data from a survey across Japan's two largest metropolitan areas, Tokyo and Osaka, were analyzed by combining crosstabulations and a binomial logit model. The results revealed that individuals are more likely to attain homeownership if they come from a metropolitan area and if their home of origin is an owner-occupied house. These findings suggest that housing inequality is being passed on to the next generation by parents' homeownership status and residential location. Japanese housing policies that promote private ownership of housing may reinforce these inequalities. The study concludes that Japan experiences the same intergenerational transmission of housing inequality due to homeownership as other countries, whereas place of origin was an additional factor for homeownership in the Japanese context.","Fukuda, Ryo","Sho, Kojiro","Kidokoro, Tetsuo","Lim, Hwajin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,CITIES,Japan,Housing inequality,Housing ladder,Homeownership,Birthplace,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2024,Inheriting housing inequality: Parental homeownership and place of origin as key factors for homeownership in Japanese metropolitan areas
Row_82,"A major problem for policymakers is to ensure that levels of citizen participation reflect the society in its diversity, but they must also ensure that those citizens who want to get involved have the means to do so. Despite empirical evidence of the role of urban planning in health, well-being, and livability, studies have not delved into the implications of how low-density sprawled urban forms influence civic involvement. This paper adds new evidence regarding the significance of urban form, built environment characteristics and more in general city planning, as intermediary factors between public and private life connected to civic engagement and public space use. Based on surveys and geographic data from the Greater Metropolitan Area of San Jose ', in Costa Rica, the article investigates how the results of citizen participation change depending on whether residents are from a compact or dispersed study area, relating to urban rhythms and mobility metrics. Findings suggest that inhabitants of group A (lower-density neighborhoods) differ significantly from group B (compact-city areas) in four variables: means of mobility, commuting time, public space use, and civic activism, while having similar sociodemographic composition. Compared with residents of group A, group B report higher levels of use and knowledge of public spaces and civic participation. These two aspects constitute, the Urban Civic Participation Index, which, related to self-reported free time, forms what we define as Public Time. The main characteristics of the compact city (higher population and building density, high street connectivity, grid presence and proximity of services, mixed land use) were found to be positively related to the outcomes of accessibility to public space and community participation. In contrast, there are no significant differences in the availability of free time between the two groups. This study, along with others on the compact city, shows that there are other reasons to reduce daily commuting distances in cities and the need of urban time policies to redesign urban society's temporal dimension besides the known environmental impacts. It also raises the question of how low urban density affects people's time and disposition to participate in public life.","Pilia, Margherita Valle","Fonseca, Franklin Ramirez",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,CITIES,Public space,Urban sprawl,Compact city,Urban form,Civic engagement,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 2024,"The influence of the urban model on civic involvement and public time.

Row_117,"Multidimensional inequalities have been increasingly discussed in the transportation field, particularly in the case of bike riding. Although several studies focused on the gender differences in bike-share systems, only a few include socioeconomic inequalities and the dimension of race. This study considers a multidimensional perspective, relating the urban space characteristics, cycling infrastructure and bike-sharing mobility distribution patterns. We analyzed the data collected from bike-share systems of five major Brazilian cities to investigate the aspects of cycling behavior in terms of gender. Additionally, we examined the uneven access to cycling infrastructure, considering its socio-spatial inequalities. The obtained results confirm the lack of female bike-sharing cyclists at different levels. The gender difference decreased for bike-share trips with longer durations and recreational purposes. In seaside towns, women represented a higher participation percentage in bike-share cycling, particularly in recreational areas such as parks, seafronts, and lakesides. Although cycle lanes reduced the disparity, they did not ensure the gender balance as observed in recreational areas. The proportion of female bike-share cyclists reduced in areas lacking cycle lanes and near metro-rail stations. Furthermore, the peripheries with more Black and lower-class inhabitants lack bike-friendly spaces, which are vital for promoting more sustainable and equitable cities.","Fortes, Laura M.","Giannotti, Mariana","de Freitas, Flavio Soares",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,CITIES,Gender mobility,Uneven access,Cycling infrastructure,Bike-share system,Mobility pattern,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 2024,"Gender, class and race uneven access to bike systems across five Brazilian cities"
Row_130,"Research on the geography of metropolitan opportunities has focused on a set of opportunities in different urban areas over time to justify policy interventions. The Beijing government implemented large-scale policy interventions to achieve structural industrial changes in order to stop the downward spiral of poverty and segregation in ""urban villages."" Beijing has accelerated the redevelopment of urban villages and helped tens of thousands of low-wage migrant workers in garment villages move to surrounding secondary cities or small towns in Hebei Province with better opportunities. However, low-wage migrant workers did not respond linearly to the intervention. This study analyzes the reasons underlying the response of low-wage migrant workers to these policy interventions. First, the antipoverty policy is a geographic exercise, moving low-end industries from a global center to peripheral locations. This study considers why this mobility strategy for improving opportunity has become the arena for opportunistic behavior and conceptualizes the logic of opportunism and the self-worth of low-wage migrant workers in a metropolitan area. Second, the Beijing government is attempting to disperse the low-end informal industries into formal industrial bases in Hebei. Dispersal campaigns inevitably involve circuitous mobility and the outcome of dispersal is inherently unstable. One of the crucial questions in dispersal strategies is scale. Would an upscaled Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) City Region or a downscaled ""neighborhood effect"" better implement the antipoverty strategy? This dispersal strategy can break up the concentration of migrants, but their perceived opportunities remain in Beijing. One of the obstacles to the full implementation of the dispersal strategy is grassroots opposition. This study uses a three-year survey conducted prior to the COVID-19 lockdown to analyze how displaced migrant workers perceive these opportunities in their processual and networked decision-making. Garment villages are important ""anchor places"" where migrants can mobilize their social capital and facilitate upward mobility outside a dominant institution in Beijing. This study reveals how garment workers replicated informal habitats in more remote locations in Beijing as the old habitats disappeared.","Liu, Ran","Huang, Xu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,CITIES,Geography of opportunity (GO),Migrants,Value,Urban village,Beijing -Tianjin -Hebei (BTH),Garment industry,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2024,"Changing value system, shifting geography of opportunity: Trajectory of migrant workers in the garment industry in Beijing"
Row_142,"In major metropolitan areas, gentrification, financialisation and welfare retrenchment contribute to a severe housing crisis. Over the past 20 years, home price inflation and affordable housing shrinkage have been particularly acute in Paris. Such issues have been linked to the displacement of lower-income Parisians and the suburbanisation of poverty on a regional scale. In this article, we match disaggregated data from the Family Benefits Fund (CAF) with information on local housing markets, to empirically document these expulsionary processes. Our methodology is twofold. First, we investigate out-migration factors using logistic regressions. Second, we compare households' changes in access to the city centre and urban resources following a move. Data show that social vulnerability is associated with a greater risk of leaving Paris and that housing welfare is playing a crucial role in mitigating this risk. Also, the higher the pressure on local housing markets, the more social inequalities determine mobility behaviour. Finally, beyond the effects of family structure, patterns of decentralisation are related to income level: less affluent households go farther from the city centre, job opportunities and services than higher-income households.","Guibard, Luc","Le Goix, Renaud",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,URBAN STUDIES,decentralisation,displacement,exclusion,gentrification,housing,out-migration,poverty,,,,,,,,,AUG 2024,Those who leave: Out-migration and decentralisation of welfare beneficiaries in gentrified Paris
Row_167,"Megacities are major contributors to global road CO2 emissions, highlighting their pivotal role in achieving lowcarbon development. However, comprehensive studies on emission patterns and decarbonization strategies in these metropolitan areas remain limited. This study presents a novel and portable big data-based workflow for megacities to reveal their spatiotemporal dynamics of road CO2 emissions and quantify decarbonization potentials associated with inter-city travel and the 15-minute city concept. We take Guangzhou City (China) as a case study. Our results reveal that primary purpose trips produce 17 % more CO2 emissions than secondary trips on average. Inter-city trips account for 36.3 % of the total emissions in the city, and those for primary purposes exhibit closer spatial distributions with intra-city trips. While providing more 15-minute-walk POIs exhibits a marginally diminishing effect on reducing trip average emissions, comprehensive implementation of the 15-minute city concept in Guangzhou can reduce up to 56.3 % of the total emissions from non-home-related passenger trips, with variations observed across different trip purposes (40 %-70 %). A significant ""head effect"" of decarbonization potential across communities exists for all trip purposes. Our study highlights the environmental limitations of monocentric urban planning models in megacities and contributes valuable insights for crafting effective strategies for sustainable urban development.","Chen, Wangyang","Tan, Ziyi","Wu, Yaxin","Biljecki, Filip","Liao, Shunyi","Zhou, Qingya","Li, Hongbao","Zheng, Yuming","Gao, Feng",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,CITIES,Sustainable development,Urban mobility,Road transport,Carbon emission,Trip purpose,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2024,Decarbonizing megacities: A spatiotemporal analysis considering inter-city travel and the 15-minute city concept

Row_198,"Ethnoracial segregation persists as a pressing issue in American cities. Understanding these issues is crucial for promoting social equity and justice, and planning more inclusive cities. Prior research has predominantly emphasized residential ethnoracial diversity but has often overlooked or inadequately addressed ethnoracial diversity and segregation in individuals' daily activities and places they visit, due in part to data limitations. This study leverages a dynamic measure of ethnoracial diversity and dominance at the finest spatial scale, specifically at the Points of Interest (POI) level and various temporal contexts. Using one month of privacy-enhanced mobile phone location data in Los Angeles County, California, this study explores ethnoracial diversity and spatial segregation simultaneously in POI visits in LA County. Our findings confirm that individuals' daily mobility in urban areas enhances ethnoracial mixing at activity locations. Empirical results indicate that the diversity of visitors to a POI is significantly higher than the neighborhood diversity where the same POI is located. A significant positive linear relationship was found between the neighborhood diversity of POIs and the diversity of visitors. About 34 % of the variance in the diversity of visitors to POIs can be explained by the neighborhood diversity of POIs. Our results also suggest significant spatial clusters of isolated/integrated areas regarding ethnoracial mixing in people's daily activity locations. Notably, the Hispanic or Latino population tends to stay in their own communities and experiences a higher level of segregation in their daily activity locations. The findings have significant implications for urban planners and policymakers to design targeted solutions and policies to promote social equity, integration, and equal access to public amenities and opportunities in urban spaces.","Su, Rongxiang","Newsham, Niall","Dodge, Somayeh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS,Ethnoracial diversity,Segregation,Point of interest,Mobile phone data,Human activities,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,Spatiotemporal dynamics of ethnoracial diversity and segregation in Los Angeles County: Insights from mobile phone data
Row_201,"Food deserts in Chile present a singularity in the context of the Global South. Unlike other countries where food security is mainly achieved through informal trade, in Chile, weekly streets markets is the structural system providing fresh food. Supermarkets complement spatially and functionally street markets. Both systems and their temporal operation makes that the Chilean food deserts main characteristic is their intermittency. The purpose of this research is to analyze the Chilean food deserts to contrast them with the predominant North and Global South discourses and position the Chilean case internationally. Specifically, this article looks to analyze the importance of the spatiotemporal dimension in food access studies where a healthy diet depends on systems other than supermarkets characterized by intermittent operation over week. For this purpose, this article takes the Metropolitan Area of Concepcion as case. First, the research identifies the location and the socioeconomic groups associated with the different degrees of access from a static perspective based on the spatial distribution of supermarkets and street markets. Then, the dynamic analysis introduces the time dimension to reveal the variability of access patterns and the impact on vulnerable groups. The intermittency of the food deserts positions Chile as halfway between the Global South and North models. The particularity of this model is that intermittently and regularly provides a healthy food environment within food deserts. Additionaly, it has the potential to be planned for overcoming structural inequalities in spatial fresh food access.","Zazo-Moratalla, Ana","Orellana-McBride, Alejandro",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,HABITAT INTERNATIONAL,Food access,Healthy diet,Supermarkets,Street markets,Informality,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2024,Intermittent food deserts.

Row_228,"The influence of specific local land-use activities (continuously redistributing elements across environments) and environmental conditions (altering the chemical composition of airborne particulate matter) on the intrinsic health risk of PM 2.5 exposure is sparsely reported. To fill this gap, we employed a novel integrated approach to address the influence of short-term changes in source-specific PM 2.5 composition on the exposure-response risk, while controlling for weather conditions. We combine receptor-based source apportionment with conditional logistic regression in a space-time-stratified case-crossover design. This approach is different from previous studies as it: i) controls the impact of spatiotemporal variations in air pollution and human mobility using multilocation-specific fixed and disjointed space-time strata ii) addresses the spatial heterogeneity of personal exposure separating its variable effect from other predictors by allowing different baseline hazards for each space-time stratum; iii) aligns case/control periods with strong/regular episodes of source-specific PM-multi- pollutant fingerprint contributions rather than health outcomes. This enabled comprehensive examination of the association between source-specific PM2.5-bound species and cardiorespiratory disease hospitalizations. The epidemiological findings were that primary anthropogenic emissions [industrial (ORs 2.5 - 4.8)] were associated with higher 1-day moving average PM-induced risks. Natural-related sources [fresh / aged sea salt aerosol, dust, soil resuspension] and secondary sulfate formation were consistently associated with higher health risks (ORs 1.0 - 1.54) after 1 to 5-days since exposure. The results emphasize the importance of source-specific air quality management in complex areas and our research provides an adaptable universal tool to support targeted place- based policy interventions to mitigate air pollution impacts on health.","Silva, Jessica Caroline dos Santos","Potgieter-Vermaak, Sanja","Medeiros, Sandra Helena Westrupp","da Silva, Luiz Vitor","Ferreira, Danielli Ventura","Godoi, Ana Flavia Locateli","Yamamoto, Carlos Itsuo","Godoi, Ricardo Henrique Moreton",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS,Air pollution exposure,Atmospheric chemistry,Case-crossover study,Hospital admission,Water-soluble inorganic ions,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 5 2024,A fingerprint of source-specific health risk of PM2.5-bound components over a coastal industrial city
