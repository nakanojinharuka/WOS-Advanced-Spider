Row_1,"Urban renewal has been an important strategic choice to promote urban development. It involves multiple stakeholders with different interests, such as the government, enterprises, communities, and residents, which is a complex collective action. Therefore, how to coordinate the complex interest demands of various stakeholders in urban renewal, improve the efficiency of urban renewal projects, and ensure the orderly progress of urban renewal is crucial. To address this issue, a network model of urban renewal by using the social network method is constructed. The networks of 531 Shenzhen urban renewal projects and 300 Chongqing urban renewal projects in 2019 were compared and analyzed by UCINET6 software. This study takes urban renewal project governance as the research objective and makes a more comprehensive analysis of the existing problems in urban renewal. The results show that the cooperative relationship of multiple entities in the process of urban renewal affects the result of urban renewal. Improving the cooperative relationship between multiple entities in urban renewal will facilitate the successful implementation of urban renewal projects and improve the effect of urban renewal. Finally, to promote the realization of the diversified goals of urban renewal, this study proposes strategies to improve urban renewal governance from many aspects: optimize the urban renewal negotiation platform, increase the participation of multiple entities in urban renewal, regulate the behavior of participants in urban renewal through policies and regulations.","Zhang, Wei","Zhang, Xinxin","Wu, Guangdong",,,,,,,,,,,62,LAND USE POLICY,Urban renewal,Social network,China,Governance,Comparative analysis,DECISION-MAKING,CREATIVE CITIES,REGENERATION,POLICY,MODEL,SUSTAINABILITY,COMPETITIVENESS,TRANSFORMATION,STAKEHOLDERS,PERFORMANCE,,,,,,,,JUL 2021,The network governance of urban renewal: A comparative analysis of two cities in China
Row_2,"As a complex systematic process, urban renewal needs to balance the multiple goals that transfer the original socio-economic foundation to the contemporary social-economic needs under a multi-stakeholder environment. The urban renewal mode decision determines the planning direction in an urban renewal project. How to select options from different urban renewal modes before implementation phase has been a decision-making dilemma. No existing method yet is available to give a satisfactory solution. Therefore, an existing experience-based method for analyzing and summarizing rules of urban renewal mode decision is suitable for this study. This paper adopts experience-based mining method to extract practical experiences from previous urban renewal projects for supporting urban renewal mode decisions with involvement of multi-stakeholder. Data are retrieved from materials of urban renewal projects in China, and an experience-based mining system of urban renewal mode decisions is constructed through text mining and case experience engine. The results reveal that: (1) Urban renewal mode decisions can be supported by experience extracted from case base of urban renewal mode decisions; (2) Urban renewal modes can be classified to development modes (conservation, renovation and redevelopment), resettlement modes (on-site resettlement and off-site resettlement), mode decisions relate to development foundation, development demand and multi-stakeholders? decision-making role; (3) Different groups of stakeholders represent differentiated renewal demand preferences. The decision-making roles of some groups are not fully available in current urban renewal practices. The experience-based mining approach provides practical support for urban renewal mode decisions that could be relevant key points for guidance of future urban renewal decision-making in China.","Zhou, Yulin","Lan, Feng","Zhou, Tao",,,,,,,,,,,34,LAND USE POLICY,Experience-based mining,Existing practice,Urban renewal mode decisions,Multi-stakeholder,SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS,INFORMATION,GOVERNANCE,NETWORK,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2021,An experience-based mining approach to supporting urban renewal mode decisions under a multi-stakeholder environment in China
Row_3,"A good understanding of urban renewal mechanisms is conducive to establishing an efficient spatial governance system. Although previous theories have explained the factors affecting urban renewal, such studies have failed to identify the differences among the drivers of multifunctional types of urban renewal, leading generalized urban renewal policies to fail. To extend the urban renewal theory from a typological perspective, this paper presents a study that identified the similarities and differences in the mechanisms of the multifunctional types of urban renewal projects implemented in Shenzhen, China. Multisource data, such as planning permits, were used to identify the urban renewal projects implemented in Shenzhen, China, between 2010 and 2020 as well as the prerenewal and postrenewal functions of these projects. The results indicate that 1) the regression model accuracy is 60.3 % for urban renewal as a whole. The classification of urban renewal projects improves the goodness of fit of the regression model by 0.16. 2) Land location, land prices, and policies were found to exert a greater influence on urban renewal than other factors, indicating that public demand plays a weaker role in driving urban renewal projects than the government or developers do. 3) The major types of urban renewal can be categorized into three typical driving modes: government-oriented urban renewal, which includes new industrial and public service projects; production-oriented urban renewal, which includes the conversion of industrial land into commercial or residential functions; and consumption-oriented urban renewal, including new residential projects implemented to accommodate the housing needs of an increasing population. Urban planners and policymakers can apply the results to classify urban renewal projects and adopt appropriate strategies for each type to achieve reasonable resource allocation and sustainable development.","Cao, Kexin","Deng, Yu","Song, Ci",,,,,,,,,,,19,CITIES,Urban renewal,Spatial governance,Driving forces,Planning permit,The Rent Gap Theory,LAND-USE CHANGE,NEW-YORK-CITY,RENT-GAP,INDUSTRIAL LAND,TOURISM GENTRIFICATION,DECISION-MAKING,REDEVELOPMENT,REGENERATION,EXPERIENCES,POLICIES,,,,,,,,JUN 2023,"Exploring the drivers of urban renewal through comparative modeling of multiple types in Shenzhen, China"
Row_4,"This study examined the impact of urban renewal delineation time on housing prices in neighborhoods undergoing urban renewal. More specifically, the study used the difference-in-difference method to assess successful housing transactions in Taipei City from 2008 to 2011. According to the empirical results, before the implementation of urban renewal, the average housing price in the areas that later underwent urban renewal (the treatment group) was lower than that in neighborhoods that did not undergo urban renewal (the control group) by 11,180 NTD. After the urban renewal projects were publicly announced, the price per ping of the control group was increased by 148,800 NTD, while the price per ping of the treatment group was increased by 163,680 NTD. This means that the housing prices per ping in the urban renewal areas were increased by 14,880 NTD more than the housing prices per ping in the areas not affected by urban renewal after the urban renewal projects were publicly announced. This increase, then, indicates the value added after implementation of urban renewal delineation time on houses in the neighborhood. Therefore, research into the impact of urban renewal on housing prices should be concerned not only with the neighborhood factors or time factors of urban renewal delineation. Rather, the two types of factors should be considered at the same time.","Lee, Chun-chang","Liang, Chih-Min","Chen, Chia-Yu",,,,,,,,,,,42,JOURNAL OF HOUSING AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT,Urban renewal,Housing prices,Urban renewal delineation time,Difference-in-difference method,GENTRIFICATION,EXTERNALITIES,VALUES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2017,The impact of urban renewal on neighborhood housing prices in Taipei: an application of the difference-in-difference method
Row_5,"Urban renewal is a critical avenue and strategic tool for achieving high-quality and sustainable development, and the residential market plays a vital role in promoting urban renewal and urban growth. However, the impact of urban renewal on housing prices remains inconclusive, closely tied to the characteristics of the study area, the sources of research data, and so on. To address this, we employ the difference-in-difference method and a mixed panel dataset of housing transactions from 2010 to 2021 to analyze in detail the effects of different urban renewal types (Industrial Renewal, Residential Renewal, and Commercial Renewal) on surrounding housing prices in Bao'an District at different renewal phases (announcement, start, and completion). We found that In-dustrial Renewal exerts the most significant impact on housing prices at the beginning and completion of renewal, followed by Residential Renewal and Commercial Renewal. Moreover, Urban renewal generates both positive and negative externalities on housing prices, especially in the case of numerous small-scale renewal projects. The findings suggest that urban renewal should be supported by systematic research on renewal types, the establishment of scale entry threshold, and the monitoring of the entire process.","Wu, Si -Min","Deng, Yu",,,,,,,,,,,,5,CITIES,Urban renewal types,Housing prices,Stages,Scale,Shenzhen,SCHOOL-DISTRICT,QUALITY,PROJECT,GROWTH,AREA,CITY,,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 2024,Typological differentiation and time-series effects of urban renewal on housing prices
Row_6,"During 2016-2018 rapid urban renewal has taken place within Beijing inner city. Scientific understanding of the regional differentiations and driving mechanisms of current urban renewal will improve strategy of the functional extraction and renewal policies. In this respect, we have used points of interest (POI) data and cellphone signaling data to analyze the urban renewal patterns based on several pattern identification and spatial analysis methods, including spatial intensity analysis, dominant pattern analysis and cooperativity analysis. On the basis of this, four types of urban renewal mode and their combinations are distinguished, including all POIs renewal dominated, restaurant renewal dominated, transportation and warehousing renewal dominated, transportation and warehousing renewal dominated with restaurant renewal assisted. Furthermore, according to the division of regional occupational-residential functions and regional population activity, four forms of basic regional conditions were obtained: balanced inactive area, balanced active area, employment active area, and residential active area, which well explains the formation mechanism of urban renewal heterogeneity. Lastly, the comparison between urban renewal what happed in Beijing and other cities is made, so as to put forward aspects concerning improved strategy of the functional extraction and urban renewal.","Zhou, Daojing","Xu, Shan","Sun, Chuanzhun","Deng, Yu",,,,,,,,,,22,HABITAT INTERNATIONAL,Urban renewal,Inner city,Urban planning,Population decentralization,Formation mechanism,Spatial heterogeneity,Beijing,RENT-GAP,SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES,GENTRIFICATION,INFRASTRUCTURE,URBANIZATION,TRANSITIONS,,,,,,,,,,MAY 2021,Dynamic and drivers of spatial change in rapid urban renewal within Beijing inner city
Row_7,"In the 1990s and 2000s, inner city neighborhood redevelopment occurred throughout the United States as billions in public and private investments entered impoverished black communities. This revitalization process led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of African-Americans. Based on this circumstance, some scholars suggest that this circumstance was a return to the past urban renewal period (1949-1974). While there have been many case studies of contemporary inner city redevelopment, this article uses a comparative historical approach to claim that we have entered and completed a new urban renewal period (1992-2007) that rivals but yet is distinct from the old urban renewal period in four important ways. First, the new urban renewal was a central business district (CBD) expansion strategy, whereas the old urban renewal was a preservation strategy. Second, the dynamics driving the new urban renewal were more complex and included global, federal, and local factors, while federal forces were more important in structuring the old urban renewal. Third, the consequences of the new urban renewal were not explained by race alone but involved an interaction between race and class. Lastly, the new urban renewal was associated with rising suburban poverty and the old urban renewal institutionalized the inner city ghetto. Specifying the parallels and differences between the old and new urban renewal periods is vital for understanding how twentieth- and twenty-first-century urban policies, and their consequences, relate to an ever-changing metropolitan America.","Hyra, Derek S.",,,,,,,,,,,,,170,URBAN AFFAIRS REVIEW,urban renewal,inner city redevelopment,race,housing policy,HOPE VI,HOUSING POLICY,GENTRIFICATION,DISPLACEMENT,RACE,CITY,OPPORTUNITIES,RETURN,RISK,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2012,Conceptualizing the New Urban Renewal: Comparing the Past to the Present
Row_8,"Urban renewal is the result of collaborative governance among multiple stakeholders, and identifying the matching relationship between different urban renewal models and their performance is conducive to a more precise allocation of resources for urban renewal in various cities. In this study, we constructed a six-dimensional framework of benefits, covering local government, the regional economy, cultural preservation, social governance, ecological protection, and the role of cities. The work encompassed 18 evaluation indicators driving urban renewal based on urban renewal data from 20 cities in China. We employed the entropy weight and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) methods to develop three urban renewal performance driving models-the comprehensive development model, political-ecological synergistic driving model, and economic-cultural weakness model. Furthermore, we categorized the characteristics of urban renewal in the 20 cities, providing theoretical support for the tailored formulation of differentiated urban renewal strategies based on each city's development status.","Chen, Zhen","Fan, Jie",,,,,,,,,,,,0,JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT,Urban renewal performance,Entropy weight method,Fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis,six-dimensional benefit framework,CHINA,REGENERATION,SUSTAINABILITY,IMPACT,PERSPECTIVE,PROJECTS,POLICIES,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 1 2024,Influence of Grouping and Driving Mechanisms on Urban Renewal Performance Using a Six-Dimensional Benefit Framework
Row_9,"This paper chooses government, resident and developer for the core stakeholders of the urban renewal who can affect the realization of the urban renewal objectives during the whole life cycle of the urban renewal construction. Based on the analysis of literature summary about urban renewal, this paper confirms 30 influence factors of comprehensive benefits in urban renewal through the questionnaire. The evaluation index system of 16 factors containing three subsystems of government benefits, resident benefits and developer benefits is established through factor analysis theory. Entropy method was then used to assign weights on criteria and macro-criteria. The weights of government, residents and developers are respectively 0.343, 0.386, 0.271. Then an evaluation model of urban renewal comprehensive benefit is put up. Fuzzy theory is used to calculate the evaluation values of Lieder village renewal in Guangzhou and the evaluation result shows that the comprehensive benefit evaluation of Lieder village renewal is good. The result is accord with actual. It has a certain practical value for the evaluation model used on the comprehensive benefit evaluation of urban renewal. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The research categorizes renewal projects based on changes in buildings, underlying surfaces, and functions. Using the Spearman correlation coefficient and LOWESS method, the study analyzes the relationships between cooling effects and impact factors. The results reveal that transforming industrial areas into commercial or residential zones and transitioning from compact mid-rise to open high-rise structures have significant cooling effects. However, the renewal implementation of the latter transformation can exacerbate the local UHI, suggesting the need for optimizing the timeline of such projects. Increasing vegetation cover plays a crucial role in mitigating the UHI, while higher floor area ratios and building volumes do not necessarily intensify the UHI. To improve the urban ecosystem, urban renewal planning should prioritize the creation of blue and green spaces, incorporation of natural infrastructure, and reduction of impervious surfaces. These findings have implications for urban renewal policies, selection of preferred renewal types, and insights into the renewal process.","Zheng, Songqing","Chen, Xiaochun","Liu, Yilun",,,,,,,,,,,21,SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY,Urban renewal,Urban heat island,Land redevelopment process,Shenzhen,LAND-SURFACE TEMPERATURE,CLIMATE ZONE SCHEME,REDEVELOPMENT,URBANIZATION,VENTILATION,GUANGZHOU,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2023,Impact of urban renewal on urban heat island: Study of renewal processes and thermal effects

Row_13,"Contemporary urban renewal policies worldwide are often presented as ""win-win"" opportunities, benefiting not only public authorities and private developers but also all target populations. The study, using a Tel Aviv neighborhood as a test case, challenges this prevailing idyllic perception by evaluating the social, economic, and physical outcomes of urban renewal at the household level, according to three tensions inherent in any residential urban renewal project. The research findings, outlining the urban renewal matrix-that is, the costs and benefits of urban renewal for various residents-reflect a complex reality with positive and negative consequences for different resident groups. Although urban renewal has significantly improved the housing conditions and surrounding environment, and although it promises some residents substantial future financial gain, it has also created a divided community, imposed pronounced affordability burdens that expose disadvantaged residents to economic displacement, and has not adequately adapted transportation and education services to population growth and residents' expectations. At a time when urban renewal is no longer a matter of choice, understanding the urban renewal matrix may help planners and policy makers bring the renewal process closer to its stated goals of improving the quality of life and encouraging the social mobility of disadvantaged populations.","Nachmany, Harel","Hananel, Ravit",,,,,,,,,,,,9,LAND USE POLICY,Urban renewal,Regeneration,Housing policy,Planning policy,Social mobility,SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,SOCIAL MIX,REGENERATION,GENTRIFICATION,NEOLIBERALISM,NEIGHBORHOOD,COMMUNITY,POLITICS,POLICY,GEOGRAPHIES,,,,,,,,AUG 2023,The Urban Renewal Matrix
Row_14,"If carefully planned, urban renewal may play an important role in regenerating a decaying neighborhood and mitigating the negative externality generated by dilapidated buildings in densely populated areas. Despite its potential benefits, in urban areas dominated by high-rise developments, urban renewal has an unintended negative impact on nearby properties since it reduces their redevelopment option values. In this study, we develop a number of hypotheses on how an urban renewal project, once made known to the public, affects neighborhood housing prices and test them with data in Hong Kong. Our empirical findings suggest that the degree of positive externalities brought by urban renewal depends on the scale of an urban renewal project, as well as the amount of commercial areas included in the project. Most importantly, through examining changes in the age coefficient, we found that an urban renewal project reduces the value of nearby buildings beyond the boundaries of the project. The negative effect was stronger for older buildings and for those buildings located closer to the project's boundaries. These unintended consequences of urban renewal have not been analyzed or tested in previous studies.","Chau, K. W.","Wong, S.

Based on an analysis of 1,086 responses to a questionnaire survey conducted among residents at different stages of the urban renewal process, multilevel linear models were used to examine the determinants of residential satisfaction after urban renewal; model results showed that 49 predictor variables explained 32.29% of residential satisfaction values in the hierarchical regression latent models. Two findings from the empirical analysis are: (1) ""Social networks and social protections"" represented the strongest predictor of residential satisfaction, followed in order of strength by ""social reciprocity and trust,"" ""community participation and accessibility,"" and ""sense of community and community cohesion""; and (2) keeping all five social factors balanced is essential for urban renewal projects, since having only one or two strong social factors will not contribute to higher residential satisfaction if the other factors are weak.

It has been increasingly recognized that heritage conservation in older districts undergoing urban renewal has a significant impact on enhancing a community's sense of place, identity and development. However, a clear understanding of the social factors which contribute to successful heritage conservation in urban renewal is still lacking. This study aims to identify the social role of heritage conservation in urban renewal. It also investigates whether certain underlying social factors vary among different districts, according to density, socio-demographics and the extent of redevelopment. In order to expose the factors, a survey of three hundred and twelve people in two urban renewal districts in Hong Kong was conducted using questionnaires. The identified social factors provide an evaluation framework for examining the collective impact of conservation of historic buildings, rather than individual historic buildings on a renewal district. The findings reveal that socio-demographics of an area, local characteristics, type of heritage buildings and the extent of urban renewal do not exert a significant influence on the composition of social factors. Several policy recommendations are also provided for urban planners and decision makers incorporating heritage conservation in urban renewal strategies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Row_21,"This study sought to demonstrate that small renewal projects could contribute to improved ventilation for the mitigation of urban heat island effects by designing building forms through urban design guidelines. Such a task is particularly important in an older built environment in many early developed cities, where large-scale urban renewal has been difficult to implement. Consequently, wind corridors are unlikely to be created to transfer heat away from cities, as suggested by previous studies. This study used computer simulations to assess the extent to which changes in building forms could drive wind flow through small-scale renewal sites. The removal of small, fragmented buildings during the renewal process was found to be of great significance for improving local ventilation, which can be regulated through urban design strategies with a low building coverage ratio. Moreover, adjusting the floor area ratio could help create open spaces that benefit on-site and off-site wind environments. This study highlighted small-scale urban renewal projects and their contribution to improving ventilation and mitigating urban heat island effects. These projects can be applied in urban renewal and regeneration through urban design guidelines for the regulation of the spatial distribution of buildings. Of note, wind factors must be integrated into site planning and architectural design processes.

Row_22,"Accurate and efficient assessment of large-scale urban renewal potential is an indispensable prerequisite for managing and facilitating projects. However, few studies consider the built environment when assessing urban renewal potential because it is difficult to measure. Street view images can show the physical setting of a place for humans to perceive the built environment. Hence, we separately extracted emotional and visual perceptions from street view images to construct a new comprehensive indicator set to assess multi-class urban renewal potentials. To establish the assessment model, we applied a backpropagation neural network based on the presence and background learning (PBL-BPNN). The renewal potential assessment based on the proposed indi-cator set can reach the highest accuracy. Emotional perceptions contribute more to assessing renewal potential than visual perceptions because they are more consistent in portraying the blighted built environment. Emotionally, the ratings of safety, boring, depression, and lively are stable in the blighted built environment. Visually, greenness and imageability often remain at lower values, highlighting the importance of greenspace and urban furniture in determining urban renewal. Furthermore, multi-class renewal potentials can be used for scenario analysis by assuming different renewal intentions.

Row_27,"The success of urban renewal projects is attributed to the synergistic development of economic, social, and environmental sustainability. However, people often seek unilateral economic benefits and ignore the coupling and coordination degree of economy-social ecological and environmental benefits. This paper attempts to evaluate the success and sustainability of urban renewal projects based on the coupling coordination degree (CCD) of economic-social-ecological benefits. Firstly, this study relies on a literature review and structural interviews to build a coupling indicator system of economic-social-ecological benefits of urban renewal projects and calculates the weight of evaluation indicators based on the entropy method. Taking 15 urban renewal projects in Guangzhou as objects, this research measures their CCD and explores the coupling relationship. The research results show that (1) among the 60 comprehensive benefit evaluation indicator elements of urban renewal projects, the indicator element with a larger weight is ""Education support facilities,"" the economic benefit indicator element with greater weight is ""Regional housing price of renewal areas,"" and the ecological benefit indicator element with a large weight is ""Vitality, and health of the urban landscape, and the characteristics of meeting the needs of residents of all ages."" (2) From the project dimension, the evaluation value of the social, economic, and ecological environment benefits of different reconstruction projects have certain differences. From the perspective of the regional dimension, the CCD of comprehensive benefits of urban renewal projects has obvious regional differences. The projects with a high CCD are mostly distributed in the most economically developed regions. The economic and social benefits of the renewal projects located in the economic core of the city center are usually higher, but their eco-environmental benefits are not necessarily the highest.

Urban renewal project selection means the identification of the most cost-beneficial projects (the projects that will produce most cost benefit) in order to maximize the net benefit to the public and to allocate resources most efficiently. In order to evaluate different urban renewal projects, a hierarchical network model based on various factors and the interactions of factors is presented. By incorporating experts' opinion, a priority index can be calculated for each urban renewal project studied, and a performance ranking of urban projects renewal can be generated. In this paper an improved urban renewal project selection methodology, which reflects interdependencies among evaluation criteria and candidate project using an integrated approach, is suggested. Finally, we introduce a method of solution through an empirical real-world urban renewal project selection example on an ongoing decision-making project in Taichung City, Taiwan using ANP-ZOGP.

Although there is a growing interest in analyzing the determinants of social networks, extant research neither accounts for the change in social networks after urban renewal nor considers the various residential groups affected by urban renewal. This work of research aims to examine the impact of urban renewal on social networks within neighborhoods based on three affected residential groups (in -site stayers, nearby stayers, and relocated residents) using data collected from six renewal areas in Chongqing, China. The results show that physical and social environmental changes significantly influence social networks during urban renewal. Socio-demographic factors such as age and education are associated with social network changes. The three affected residential groups identified significant differences in social networks after urban renewal. Nearby stayers experienced the largest increase in their network, while relocated residents experienced the most significant decrease. Social network changes for the same affected residential group also vary based on socioeconomic factors and perceptions of the residential environment.

The main instruments of this renewal policy, its results, and challenges will be presented in this paper, analyzed and dissected by empirical research. The social sustainability of Vienna's model of subsidized urban renewal is tested by indicators like rents of apartments, quality of apartments and household incomes of tenants before and after renewal by applying nonparametric statistics. Based on the notions of Lees (2015) on state-led renewal the analysis of the Vienna case provides an original contribution to the discussion on public policy-led renewal and its effects on gentrification and displacement.

We argue that the dynamics of squatter movements are directly connected to strategies of urban renewal in that movement conjunctures occur when urban regimes are in crisis. An analysis of the history of Berlin squatter movements, their political context and their effects on urban policies since the 1970s, clearly shows how massive mobilizations at the beginning of the 1980s and in the early 1990s developed in a context of transition in regimes of urban renewal. The crisis of Fordist city planning at the end of the 1970s provoked a movement of 'rehab squatting' (Instandbesetzung), which contributed to the institutionalization of 'cautious urban renewal'(behutsame Stadterneuerung) in an important way. The second rupture in Berlin's urban renewal became apparent in 1989 and 1990, when the necessity of restoring whole inner-city districts constituted a new, budget-straining challenge for urban policymaking. Whilst in the 1980s the squatter movement became a central condition for and a political factor of the transition to 'cautious urban renewal', in the 1990s large-scale squatting - mainly in the eastern parts of the city - is better understood as an alien element in times of neoliberal urban restructuring.","Holm, Andrej","Kuhn, Armin",,,,,,,,,,,,125,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN AND REGIONAL RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 2011,Squatting and Urban Renewal: The Interaction of Squatter Movements and Strategies of Urban Restructuring in Berlin
Row_36,"This paper attempts to analyse the politics of urban renewal through the anatomy of the conflicting discourses on the changes in China's urban villages. Specifically, this paper investigates the case of Liede Village, Guangzhou, a typical urban village in China, and its innovative reconstruction model. Based on the methods of participatory observation, in-depth interviews, and textual analysis, this paper finds that the official media conducted a topdown construction of Liede Village's reconstruction as a mainstream social and economic activity from which a modernised model for Chinese urban renewal has been strongly established; the villagers also respond to the strong construction of the official media coverage by conducting bottom-up protests that aim to safeguard their rights through alternative discourse constructions. In this sense, this study found that urban renewal is not only physical or socially related but politically related. There are significant differences in the discourse construction methods and operational logic of different power subjects. To resolve these conflicts, the discourse knowledge systems within urban villages should be reformed so that the Chinese government can more effectively govern these complex social spaces. This paper provides an alternative understanding of China's urban renewal from the perspective of discourse politics, which enriches existing studies on urban sustainability, social justice and urban governance for the wider human geographers, urban scholars and sociologists, especially the wider discussions on urban renewal in other countries.","Zhao, Yongqi","An, Ning","Chen, Huiling","Tao, Wei",,,,,,,,,,44,CITIES,Urban politics,Urban village,Urban renewal,Multiparticipation mechanism,Discourse,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,APR 2021,Politics of urban renewal: An anatomy of the conflicting discourses on the renovation of China's urban village

Traditional Chinese shophouses are a major historic building typology found in the old districts of Asian cities. In Hong Kong, the few remaining shophouses are generally deteriorating and are increasingly under threat of demolition for urban renewal. However, adaptive reuse of these buildings has created many social concerns. In light of these concerns, evaluating adaptive reuse potential needs to incorporate a much broader sustainability framework than simply physical building conditions. This study examines the extent to which obsolescence, heritage value and redevelopment pressures have affected the adaptive reuse of shophouse intervention in government-led urban renewal projects. Interestingly, the results based on adaptive reuse potential find no consistent relationships among the adaptive reuse actions of eight cases in urban renewal districts of Hong Kong. Instead, the question of revitalizing shophouses is determined by whether they are within an urban renewal redevelopment plan. This study further explores the broader urban sustainability framework reflected in eight case studies of shophouse revitalization in three renewal districts. It includes a qualitative synthesis of the social, environmental, economic, and political considerations contributing to the adaptive reuse of shophouses in urban renewal. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This critique has prompted a ""human-centric"" approach, emphasizing effective two-way communication within urban renewal. Despite this shift, there remains a significant gap in research on real-time public opinions generated from bottom-up participation in urban renewal, particularly with regard to governmental response to such micro-level feedback. Therefore, based on provincial-level panel data and microlevel opinions on the Leaders' Message Board, this research adopted a text mining method and regression model to evaluate unstructured user-generated data and explore the determinants of government responsiveness in urban renewal. The results reveal that there are more public opinions on urban renewal in economically developed regions than in less developed regions. This study also found that local governments can respond to most public opinions. Meanwhile, ""project progress inquiry"", ""quality problem"", and economic level have significant positive impacts on response timeliness, while ""information disclosure"" and ""livelihood issues"" have adverse effects. The findings are of great strategic and policy importance and can offer new insights into citizen engagement and collaborative governance in urban planning.","Shen, Chen","Wang, Yang","Xu, Yan","Li, Xiangyu",,,,,,,,,,6,CITIES,Urban renewal,Public opinions,Online participation,Government responsiveness,SENTIMENT ANALYSIS,PUBLIC-PARTICIPATION,TOPIC ANALYSIS,REGENERATION,ACCOUNTABILITY,ATTENTION,PROJECTS,POLICY,MODEL,,,,,,,,,,MAY 2024,"Unveiling citizen-government interactions in urban renewal in China: Spontaneous online opinions, reginal characteristics, and government responsiveness"

Building upon insights gained from debates about the nature of materialities within urban geography, I treat buildings as complex associations of materials, technologies and human beings that are informed by concepts about social stratification and that simultaneously enact these concepts in the physical-social landscape of the city. Processes of urban renewal therefore need to be understood as both conceptual and material interventions in the setup of the city that restructure the built environment, patterns of cohabitation, experiences of the urban and notions of self and other. I illustrate this approach with recourse to the case of urban renewal in the city centre of Mumbai, arguing that high-rise buildings emerging from urban redevelopment projects translate the heterogeneity of the Indian middle classes into a spatial vocabulary that contributes to the creation of new social categories.","Holwitt, Pablo",,,,,,,,,,,,,3,ANTIPODE,India,Mumbai,class,space,urban renewal,materialities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2021,Constructing Classes and Imagining Buildings: Urban Renewal and Transactions between Concepts and Materialities in Mumbai

This study builds a conceptual framework to understand the factors affecting elderly's right to community facilities in an urban renewal district. Through focus group meetings held in three neighborhoods in Kwun Tong district and spatial analysis, elderly's perception and the provision of community facilities were ascertained. The findings reveal how inequitable provision of community facilities, gentrification caused by transit-oriented development mode and insufficient mobility services have affected elderly's right to access community facilities and deprived their rights.

Row_70,"Chinese cities have experienced large-scale urban expansion since the 1978 reform and opening up. During the rapid development, rural villages have been absorbed and transformed into urban villages. Urban villages influence residents' lives and the housing market. However, studies on such interaction are not comprehensive. Although renewal plans have been executed in many Chinese cities, little empirical evidence on the effect of renewal was raised. Most studies obtained an average effect while neglected the varying influences of urban villages on people from different social classes. Thus, the real mechanism of the effect of urban villages and the renewal remains unclear. Therefore, this study uses the hedonic price model, the difference-in-difference model, and the quantile regression model to explore the impact of urban villages and the renewal. The empirical results show that: (1) from the overall perspective, urban villages show negative externalities on the surrounding housing price - housing price drops by 0.005% with every 1% closer to urban villages and decreases by 0.023% with every 1% increase in the scale of urban village; (2) from the social perspective, the effect of urban villages presents significant social heterogeneity - residents of higher-priced housing are more negatively affected by urban village accessibility and scale; and (3) urban village renewal positively affects surrounding housing price and compensates the negative externalities of urban village accessibility and scale. In addition, such compensating effect is significantly higher on higher-priced housing than that on lower-priced housing. The implications of this study help the government to carry out renewal plans orderly, help developers to make targeted investment strategies, and help homebuyers to make suitable purchase decisions, contributing to the sustainable development of cities.","Liu, Hongjie","Xiao, Yue","Wen, Haizhen","Ren, Hongfan","Xiong, Taorong",,,,,,,,,5,JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT,Urban village,Renewal,Externality,Housing price,Hedonic price,Social heterogeneity,HEDONIC ANALYSIS,REDEVELOPMENT,CHENGZHONGCUN,LANDSCAPE,SHENZHEN,INSIGHTS,VALUES,MARKET,LAND,,,,,,,,SEP 1 2022,"How Renewal of Urban Villages Affects Their Externalities on Housing Prices: Heterogeneous Analysis from Hangzhou, China"

I argue that these factors are articulated by a distinct ""politics of compensation""-a term that I borrow from Ananya Roy-that is particular to the contemporary neoliberal condition.

Urban renewal activities, as an important path to revitalize the used land, have become a major consideration of urban development all around the world. The development intensity of urban renewal (URDI) is an important index to reflect land use efficiency in urban renewal activities, and can serve to control development in a sustainable way. However, research related to URDI and its influencing factors remains scarce in the current literature. Therefore, following a bottom-up paradigm, in this research, the URDI was studied with project data to reveal spatiotemporal distribution characteristics and influencing factors from a microscopic perspective. Specifically, in this study, spatial autocorrelation analysis and a standard deviational ellipse were used to explore spatiotemporal heterogeneity of 483 urban renewal units for 2011-2021 in Shenzhen, one of the major cities implementing urban renewal in China, and influencing factors of the URDI were explored using a panel regression model. The findings reveal that: (1) the URDI is on the rise, presenting a developing trend from core districts to node districts; (2) there was local space mismatch in Shenzhen, with overcrowded or underutilized space in various regions; and (3) the variations in URDI in different regions can be attributed to such factors as investment activity and fiscal revenue.

This paper shows that in Barcelona's case, the relationship between urban branding and urban renewal is dialectical and disputed rather than top-down and by dictate. Thus, in the case of the Raval district, the urban and cultural planning led by local government and cultural institutions is part of a concerted effort to turn a blighted area plagued by social problems into a new global cultural district.

However, understanding the full history of urban renewal requires showing how it was shaped as both policy and idea. This essay traces the intertwined history of campaigns for both slum clearance and modern housing to show how the motives of planning, profit, and reform idealism combined to form both a modernist ""ethic of city rebuilding"" and an aggressive program for ridding the city of ""blight"" and restoring property values. Urban renewal was indebted to both, and a full accounting of its history should reveal the tense and productive relations between the two.","Zipp, Samuel",,,,,,,,,,,,,70,JOURNAL OF URBAN HISTORY,urban renewal,modern housing,real estate,urban planning,public housing,slum clearance,NEW-YORK,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 2013,The Roots and Routes of Urban Renewal
Row_80,"This paper explores the politics of 'waiting' as a mode of governance in large-scale urban redevelopment projects. In designated renewal areas, residents/landowners are often subject to several episodes of waiting: waiting for the public authority for information on redevelopment visions; waiting for the plans and projects to become public; waiting for the court ruling if they appeal the plans; waiting for demolition upon plan approvals; and, finally, waiting for the constructions to be completed. Given the complexity of actors and institutions involved in the waiting, it becomes a conflictual political process. This prolonged waiting leads to an ongoing temporariness and precarious spaces of urban renewal. The course of waiting affects the reorganization of the city space ""now"" and in the future. We analyze two protracted urban renewal projects from Turkey, Fikirtepe in Istanbul and Karabaglar in Izmir, to explore how residents' decade-long waiting for urban change are shaped and how these diverse waiting experiences lead to different outcomes for the progression of the state-imposed urban renewal agendas. While Karabaglar residents have unified around active bottom-up resistance from the beginning to challenge the project-based plans the central government imposed, Fikirtepe residents pursued individual-level negotiations with developers to maximize private returns following the zoning incentives the public authority gave. Despite the socio-spatial similarities between these designated urban renewal project sites, variances in residents' collective waiting strategies have led to different urban politics around project-based urban change.","Ay, Deniz","Penpecioglu, Mehmet",,,,,,,,,,,,0,ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING C-POLITICS AND SPACE,Waiting,urban renewal,temporal politics,large-scale redevelopment,Turkey,SPACES,STATE,SUBJECTIVITY,TEMPORALITY,ECONOMY,CITIES,SCALE,POWER,TIME,,,,,,,,,SEP 2024,"Politics of ""waiting for transformation"" in protracted urban renewal projects in Turkey"

Drawing on archives of official correspondence and oral histories of neighborhood residents, we chart the various ways by which the university administrators initiated and guided urban renewal and slum clearance in several largely African American neighbor-hoods adjacent to campus in tandem with the city of Columbia. We place a particular focus on the Wheeler Hill neighborhood to illustrate how university property acquisition occurred alongside the federal urban renewal process, and how the process slowly destabilized and ultimately unraveled the neighborhood. In doing so we contribute to the growing literature on universities and urban renewal and capture the methods and underlying racist intentions through which universities have reshaped the urban landscape. We argue that at a time when universities across the United States are beginning to grapple with their own racial histories, it is crucial to more fully acknowledge the ways in which university expansion has impacted, and indeed targeted, adjacent communities of color.

The theoretical analysis shows that the problem of multi-ownership has played a key role in fostering the pattern of urban renewal in Hong Kong. Given this we propose that the political power of resumption (i.e., taking or eminent domain) critically shapes the URA's low-cost advantage in land assembly and forms the basis that carves a niche for state-led redevelopment.

Usually the process happens without real participation of residents and focuses only on physical aspects resulting in a range of sustainability challenges. This study aimed at understanding citizens' concerns and identifying assessment indicators for sustainable urban renewal in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Two purposively selected inner city slum neighborhoods before (Golla Sefer) and after renewal (relocated households due to Lideta Condominium) were examined from bottom-up side. Using multidisciplinary experts and literature review, twenty-six urban sustainability indicators were identified. The indicators were later used to assess the renewal in Lideta Condominium using Likert-Scale. Results showed that households' concerns focused on livelihood, affordability, social network, security and proximity issues as these factors directly affect their daily lives. Expert's assessment revealed that the renewal has brought improvement in land value while important economic indicators like affordability, job creation showed poor performance of varying percentage. Social indicators such as social network and safety showed poor assessment result while access to transport showed improvement. Some environmental indicators such as open space quantity, road and walkway and mixity showed improvements while governance has poor assessment result. Therefore, future renewal should improve public participation, revise the focus on home ownership, minimize relocation and enhance urban design. The study underlines important indicators from households' perspective and other relevant indicators, which are important to sustainably guide future renewal in Ethiopia and other Sub-Saharan African cities with similar context.","Zewdie, Meskerem","Worku, Hailu","Bantider, Amare",,,,,,,,,,,13,JOURNAL OF HOUSING AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT,Addis ababa,Sustainability indicators,Urban renewal,Urban sustainability,INDICATORS,REGENERATION,PROJECTS,PERSPECTIVES,COMMUNITIES,PERFORMANCE,QUALITY,DESIGN,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2021,Inner City Urban Renewal: Assessing the Sustainability and Implications for Urban Landscape Change of Addis Ababa

To accommodate the needs of participatory e-planning, we designed a digital collaborative platform composed of four modules to establish a framework for all stakeholders to participate in the urban renewal process in China. By taking a village as a case study (hereafter referred to as village X), this research introduces the application of a digital platform in the renewal of an old village facilitated by a third party. Although the application of e-planning participation in the renewal of X village has been effective, its further application has encountered challenges, such as willingness, the capacity of the residents, and credibility, due to the lack of an institutionalized arrangement. Compared with the West, China has a long way to go in promoting public participation in urban renewal through institutional arrangements. Educating the public and deepening the understanding of local governments in the necessity of public participation should be the future task of urban planners in China.

As the urban development model transitions to urban regeneration, the efficacy of spatial policies on urban renewal remains insufficiently explored. To investigate the mechanism of multi-level spatial policies on urban renewal, we employ logit models to scrutinize the impact of four spatial policies on urban renewal in Shenzhen from 2010 to 2020, along with embedding interaction effect models to examine the interaction between multiple policies. This study comprehends the mechanism of multi-level policies in three dimensions: spatial, temporal, and interactive. (1) Small-scale spatial policies tend to have a more substantial control effect, with micro land use policies increasing the probability of urban renewal by 2.04-3.77 times. Urban renewal prioritizes inward development, demanding a higher level of spatial policy resolution. (2) Except for the planned main city centers, the effects of all policies escalate over time, with the intensity of commercial planning surging up to 139% in 2016-2020 compared to the previous period. (3) Interaction effects between policies exist between policies at different scales. The effects of the main centers and the urban renewal planning reinforce each other by 37%, while the effects of the main centers and the commercial plans counteract each other by 34%. The coordination of multisectoral policies and the diversified use of policy instruments are conducive to enhancing the interactive effects between policies.","Cao, Kexin","Deng, Yu",,,,,,,,,,,,4,HABITAT INTERNATIONAL,Multi-level spatial policies,LAND-USE CHANGE,CELLULAR-AUTOMATA,TRANSITIONAL ECONOMY,LOGISTIC-REGRESSION,DECISION-SUPPORT,DETERMINANTS,GROWTH,REDEVELOPMENT,GAP,GENTRIFICATION,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2023,"The impact and interactive effects of multi-level spatial policies on urban renewal: A case study of Shenzhen, China"

In this paper, we examine the role of one such contest in shaping urban renewal outcomes in Denver, using the case of the late 1960s Auraria project. The project sought to remove a poor, Hispanic neighborhood in order to build a new downtown college campus, generating community opposition from the inner city neighborhood residents, leaders of the city's Chicano Movement, and historic preservation activists. We demonstrate how resistance actively shaped the ultimate form and character of the project, and how the legacies of this urban renewal contest extended-in unforeseen ways-beyond the immediate struggles of the time. We argue that these legacies provide the essential context for understanding planning practice, redevelopment strategies, and gentrification dynamics in the city today.","Page, Brian","Ross, Eric",,,,,,,,,,,,27,URBAN GEOGRAPHY,Urban renewal,community resistance,gentrification,Chicano Movement,historic preservation,Denver,POLITICS,STATE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017,"Legacies of a Contested Campus: Urban Renewal, Community Resistance, and the Origins of Gentrification in Denver"
Row_99,"The renewal of urban housing is a major challenge for urban policy makers in the quest for more livable, resource-efficient, and socially inclusive cities. However, the policy-making process involving urban renewal is complex. There are several agents with distinct objective functions, difficult to harmonize within the overall purpose of maximizing social welfare. Once urban renewal processes are terminated, or at least once the renewal momentum is such that it allows the rebirth of the housing market, it is unanimously agreed that all agents are better off. But this usually requires a jump start based on strong up-front public financing. Why does this happen? Is it inevitable? The effects of urban renewal are wider than the physical assets under intervention and have social, economic, and environmental implications to agents (owners, tenants, local businesses, etc.) that are not involved in the renewal processes. This paper focuses on a specific type of externalities-effects on housing prices-and tries to link the expected valorization (or not) of housing prices with the decision of owners or promoters to invest in housing renewal. The methodology used is based on an empirical game-theory model validated by a real case study-the city of Lisbon, Portugal. The conclusions are that there is no natural incentive for private investors to initiate the renewal process in a ""nonrehabilitated"" area, even considering the low purchase prices of existing buildings, because the expected profits are much lower in nonrehabilitated areas compared with the possible returns in already rehabilitated areas. The data evidence a gross profit of more than double in buy-renew-sell processes in rehabilitated areas compared with nonrehabilitated areas in the city of Lisbon, the capital of Portugal.

However, planning and design of open spaces tend to stress on the physical and safety needs of the elderly, while social needs are not frequently addressed. This study intends to identify whether the social needs of the elderly regarding the use of public open spaces in urban renewal districts are addressed in the standard planning and design guidelines which newly planned development and districts are often based upon. Eight focus groups were conducted in elderly community centers in two urban renewal districts in Hong Kong. The results indicate that elderly people consider 'social and physical activities', 'community life facilities and services' and 'social network', as well as a 'clean and pleasant environment' to be their most important needs. Thus, planners and designers should take into consideration these criteria for enhancing the social well-being of the elderly and active aging in public open spaces in urban renewal. Furthermore, it stresses that urban renewal districts are part of the elderly's past living experiences and established social networks, which is not the case in new developments and areas. As such, the users' actual needs should be elicited rather than perceived by planners and designers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Yung, Esther H.

Three empirical findings are obtained. First, the renewal raised living utility values and thus rents of the renewed properties. Second, the improvement in living utility value is partially offset by a reduction in the option value of housing redevelopment, because government planning policy specifies that the renewed neighborhoods will not be redeveloped at least in the next 5-10 years. Third, housing prices in neighborhoods farther away from scenic spots, which were generally lower, even dropped after the renewal. This evidences the complementarity between housing conditions and external environment, i.e., the renewal raises housing values less if the external environment is more inferior. These findings have important policy implications for urban renewals.","Yu, Xiaofen","Fan, Hongyi","Yang, Shangming","Yin, Huiliang","Zhang, Yanjiang",,,,,,,,,2,JOURNAL OF HOUSING AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT,Urban renewal,Aged housing,Housing value,Real option,Complementarity,URBAN-RENEWAL,REDEVELOPMENT,EXTERNALITIES,BARRIERS,IMPACTS,CITIES,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 2024,"Neighborhood renewal does not raise values of all aged residential properties: case from Hangzhou, China"

In response, urban water managers in the city of Rotterdam developed a new water management strategy combining the renewal of water infrastructure with neighborhood revitalization projects. A key factor was the recognition that additional water retention in existing urban areas could only be realized if these projects were linked to urban renewal programs. Moreover, it was acknowledged that through new water retention infrastructure the quality of the social environment of deteriorated neighborhoods could be restored. The results from this historical analysis show that this turn in thinking initiated a successful water policy innovation in Rotterdam, in which the urban water policy is used to solve other urban problems as well by improving the quality of the public amenity.

Many of the city's poorer residents rallied alongside housing advocates, civil rights organizations, and neighborhood activists, believing that federal renewal funding should be used to replace deteriorating housing stock, whether with new public housing or low-cost housing built by private developers.

Yet, as recent scholarship on industrial suburbanization has shown, the decentralization of manufacturing manifested itself throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Some scholars of twentieth-century planning have observed that urban renewal programs hurt cities as much as they helped. This essay argues that some late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century redevelopment programs played a greater causal role in deindustrialization and the shift in Americans' conceptions of cities from places of production to places of consumption.

Determining how to optimize the spatial layout of impervious surfaces is the focus of urban waterlogging prevention in urban renewal. The existing urban-renewal methods include constructing low-impact development measures by reducing the area of impervious surfaces or implementing a local high-strength design based on the ant colony algorithm (ACA) from the viewpoint of optimization design. However, these methods have obvious shortcomings in terms of time efficiency, and their optimized design schemes are insufficient at considering the global impervious surface design. Therefore, to address these problems, the study proposes a coupled model of multivariate linear programming and Soil Conservation Service curve number. The model is employed in the central city of Guangzhou, China. The results show, first, that the optimal design of impervious surfaces in urban renewal is to construct a discontinuous connection of high-low-high-density impervious surfaces; second, that, compared with ACA, our method has higher robustness, increases the average optimization rate by 4.48 to 14.00%, and reduces the optimization time over 30 days to 20.8 s; and third, that the optimal results realize the global low-strength transformation as complements of the existing design scheme of local high-strength transformation.

Green urban renewal is likely to exacerbate social injustice without adequate countermeasures. Low-income groups are more likely to be displaced since their housing spending is more elastic. However, research on whether China's new environmentally responsible green urban renewal has also aggravated socioeconomic inequity is still insufficient. Using the Happiness Forest Belt (HFB, currently the largest green infrastructure regeneration project in China) in Xi'an as a case study, our study examines whether green urban renewal actions have resulted in green gentrification. By incorporating spatial effects into the difference in differences (DID) model, our estimates show that HFB significantly and dynamically stimulated the appreciation of nearby property rents. Moreover, the lower the property rents, the more intense the impact of HFB and the more likely it was to gentrify. It confirms our concern that green urban renewal would probably result in the displacement of the poor and that green initiatives aimed at common human well-being are more beneficial to the wealthy. Based on this, we recommend that policymakers and planners realize the importance of the equitable distribution of green benefits, take innovative initiatives to address environmental injustice, and provide inclusive social and ecological solutions.","Liu, Kui","Du, Jinfeng","Cheng, Yijiao","Xia, Zheyi","Liu, Jingming",,,,,,,,,1,CITIES,Green infrastructure,Green gentrification,Urban renewal,Spatial difference in differences model,Environmental justice,URBAN,JUSTICE,IMPACT,POLICY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,Green gentrification and who will benefit from green infrastructure regeneration?

This study provides a citywide analysis on the spatial determinants of land redevelopment activities in the urban renewal processes in Shenzhen, China. Based on the concept of rent gap and a perspective of transaction costs, a conceptual framework is developed to understand land redevelopment behaviors and analyze how location factors, land property rights, land use status and urban planning collectively affect land redevelopment outcomes. Empirical analysis is conducted based on logistic regression models with unique parcel-level data of all urban renewal projects in the entire city of Shenzhen and in special economic zone (SEZ) and non-SEZ areas. This study shows that urban sites with high land rent gap levels and low transaction costs are more likely to be redeveloped earlier. Aside from location factors, land property rights, land use status and urban planning all have a significant influence on the spatial variation of land redevelopment activities. These factors have varied effects on land redevelopment in the SEZ and non-SEZ areas due to the institutional differences and development conditions in these two areas.

Row_129,"Fragmentary, degraded or abandoned industrial inner areas in cities of developing countries, such as Guadalajara, Mexico, generate urban effects that are strongly connected to the increasing spatial fragmentation in such cities. Paradoxically, conditions for the transformation of such areas into urban public spaces often exist within this context. The significance of fragmentary industrial areas is that the interplay of conditions derived from their configuration, location, which is problematic and potential may either propel their renewal and transformation into spaces for housing, commerce, culture and entertainment, or on the contrary, hinder the renewal of such areas. This affects the overall development of cities by either rebalancing the urban system, or increasing its fracture and discontinuity. The importance of this field is not only the widespread occurrence of fragmentary industrial areas during the past decades, but also their extensive transformation. This research is made by looking at a series of industrial inner city areas along the west section of the railway axis of Guadalajara, Mexico, and draws conclusions on their significance for the urban development and renewal of Guadalajara, which can illustrate analogous cases in other cities. The research aims to find spaces in which 'the city' can be reconstituted in this increasingly fragmentary urban realm.

Row_131,"Value capture in urban renewal is a controversial issue. The equality and efficiency of value capture in urban renewal is influenced not only by the percentage of value capture but also by transaction costs. A framework analyzing the transaction costs of value capture in the urban renewal process helps us understand how value capture mechanisms influence the outcomes of industrial land renewal. Our study found a new type of value capture mechanism in addition to active value capture under a public leasehold system: the value constraint mechanism. In the policy innovation of industrial land renewal in China, the government has used diversified active value capture tools in self-renewal to replace land-banking mechanism and have greatly reduced negotiation costs, but they have also increased the costs of maintaining the government's legitimacy. As a result, the government introduced value constraint mechanisms to reduce legitimacy costs by putting constraints on land user, planning conditions and transactions to limit the land holders' profit space and ensure industrial renewal generates the expected outcomes (for example, upgrading industry, stimulating technology R&D, providing jobs and taxation). However, these constraint mechanisms may once again increase information and enforcement costs and become the new main hindrance to renewal. A comparison of the policies of Shanghai and Shenzhen illustrate the government's tradeoff between maintaining political legitimacy and reducing other transaction costs through combining different value capture mechanisms in industrial land renewal policies.","Hu, Yingjie","Lu, Bin","Wu, Jiayu",,,,,,,,,,,32,LAND USE POLICY,Value capture,Industrial land renewal,Transaction costs,Public leasehold system,China,INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS,TRANSACTION COSTS,URBAN,STATE,REDEVELOPMENT,GOVERNANCE,GENTRIFICATION,URBANIZATION,MARKETS,FINANCE,,,,,,,,MAY 2019,Value capture in industrial land renewal under the public leasehold system: A policy comparison in China

Apart from physically upgrading the decaying buildings, the municipality's aim was to include the inhabitants in the urban renewal process and, seemingly, to prevent the dislocation of people from the neighbourhood. However, due to ambiguous policies, the workings of the property market and the lack of sufficient deflecting mechanisms, middle-class inhabitants are now replacing the high concentration of socioeconomically vulnerable people that characterised Vesterbro before the urban renewal.

Row_136,"In the process of rapid urban renewal, quantitative research on functional preferences and spatial layout norms of multi-type urban renewal entities is crucial for optimizing spatial governance and promoting orderly control of urban renewal. We investigate urban renewal in Beijing from 2006 to 2021 using directional distribution, spatial autocorrelation, and hotspot analysis. The findings are as follows: (1) The functional preference of each type of entity differs. While most private companies and other profit-oriented entities concentrate on producer services and residential functions, policy-oriented entities dominate the urban regeneration of public service activities. (2) Every entity shows a significant agglomeration characteristic, yet exhibits a differentiated spatial response pattern. Those entities with stronger leasing ability prefer the central zone while others are the opposite. (3) Diverse types of entities have differentiated spatiotemporal evolutions. The spatial directional divergence of state-owned enterprises and scientific research institutes has increased between 2006 and 2021. This is mainly influenced by the policy of relieving Beijing of nonessential functions. However, the rest entities show a balanced spatial development trend with the difference in each direction becoming smaller. Furthermore, the center of gravity of profit-oriented entities has shifted from the suburbs to the central zone due to a combination of administrative and market forces, whereas the center of gravity of policy-oriented entities tends to move outward from the central zone.","Xu, Shan","Liu, Boya",,,,,,,,,,,,0,HABITAT INTERNATIONAL,Urban renewal,Entity types,Functional preference,Spatial evolution,Influencing factors,FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT,LOCATION CHOICE,CHINA,LAND,FIRMS,TRANSFORMATION,AGGLOMERATION,PATTERNS,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2024,Functional preference and spatial response of urban renewal entities in Beijing
Row_137,"Land use planning plays an important role in achieving sustainable urban development. One of the problems planners frequently encounter is the absence of an integrated quantitative approach to assessing land-use suitability and supporting land use planning (site level), particularly in urban renewal. This paper develops a geographic information system (GIS)-based framework to solve this problem. The framework consists of three main modules: land information database, planning/policy control mechanism, and model of land-use suitability analysis (LUSA). In the process of developing this framework, three tasks are completed. First, key factors affecting land-use decision making in urban renewal planning are identified and 20 of them are quantitatively examined from five perspectives of land attributes: inherent/physical, locational, social, economic, and environmental. Second, two submodels, namely, the criterion-value generation model and suitability assessment model are designed and built for LUSA in land redevelopment/urban renewal. Third, five types of land use, i.e., residential, commercial, industrial, government/institutional/community (G/IC), and open space in Hong Kong are defined and considered for land-use suitability grading. Several new planning approaches such as scenario planning, public participation, and collaborative interaction are included in this framework to improve planning processes by enhancing their adoption and application in urban (land use) planning. This proposed framework is found to be a useful tool for both practitioners and researchers involved in sustainable land use planning in urban renewal.

The decision to redevelop land in the process of urban renewal will help to optimize urban spatial layout, guide functional positioning, and improve the physical environment, to solve the urban land resource shortage problem and achieve sustainable development. This research aims to simulate the dynamic trend of land-use change by using the Cellular Automata (CA) model; with various complex settings, the actual urban renewal status, as well as three scenarios for future development, are simulated and analysed in the case study of Chongqing to assist and support stakeholders in making proper decisions for future urban planning.The study proposes a method to embed the rent gap theory, which states that when the value gap between the potential ground rent and actual ground rent is larger, the attractiveness of investing capital in land redevelopment is larger. In the process of CA simulation, the rent gap theory, as a transition rules of land-use change, can reflect the internal mechanism of urban development. When the location-based spatial characteristics are used, the macro-economic factors, such as GDP, interest rate and depreciation rates, can quantify the rent gap in the CA model. In addition, based on the background of China's ""government-led"" development, combined with the real situation, the endogenous and exogenous influencing factors of the policy are used as the quantitative factors of the rent gap theory and the second type of transition rule of land evolution, respectively, which can accurately reflect the urban development.

Initially, the tenants of SDUs pay 39% more in rent than the tenants of market rate housing. Subsequently, accessibility of schools is a primary concern for SDU residents. Thirdly, SDU tenants are willing to live close to disamenities in exchange for lower rent and convenience services provided by semi-obnoxious facilities.

Row_141,"The community plays a very limited role in urban governance in pro-growth Hong Kong. Urban renewal is a case in point. The government has relied on market forces in renewing the city. In 1988, the Land Development Corporation (LDC) was set up to facilitate private-public partnerships in redevelopment. Residents were not involved until the project implementation stage, when owners needed to be compensated and tenants rehoused. However, the growing stock of dilapidated buildings, coupled with the collapse of the property market in the late 1990s, contributed to a market failure. The Urban Renewal Authority (URA) was set up in 2000 to replace the LDC and an Urban Renewal Strategy (URS) was published in 2001. This paper argues that the URS is just a redevelopment programme and that it is doubtful whether the URA can overcome problems faced by the LDC.

Due to socio-economic and legal issues in UBAs, the renovation process cannot be sufficiently realized without the intervention of both public and private sectors. As active involvement of owners, investors and urban managers in urban renovation increases the success of renewal projects, more considerable attention has been paid to owner-investor participatory models in the last few decades. In order to promote participatory urban renewal processes, a Spatial (GIS-based) Decision Support System (SDSS) has been developed. The primary objective of proposed SDSS is to present a general framework for the involvement of owners, investors, and urban managers in UBA processes. Through the integration of Public Participation Geographic Information System (PPGIS) with Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), the proposed SDSS provides an appropriate tool for the facilitation of participatory renewal procedures in UBAs. In addition to entering, storing, manipulating, analyzing and representing spatial data related to UBAs, the system provides further features for stakeholders including spatial negotiation, weighting, prioritization, validation, monitoring, and decision rule capabilities.

Row_143,"Urban villages are typical informal settlements in Chinese cities where rural villages were gradually surrounded by urban built environments during urbanisation. In the era of urban renewal, these ""urban enclaves"" have been systematically demolished due to their ""chaotic"" building layouts and ""backward"" appearance. Existing policies related to the redevelopment of urban villages mainly follow a ""demolish-rebuild"" orientation, while lacking sufficient consideration of the mechanisms behind their environmental aspects and performances. In the long run, such a direction of urban redevelopment will hinder the achievement of sustainable development goals. This paper reviews the major municipal-level policies that relate to urban villages and urban renewal in Shenzhen through the adoption of systematic literature survey and content analysis. An analytical framework of ""Three Contents and Six Instruments"" is established to examine the highlighted and overlooked aspects of these policies. Results reveal that Shenzhen's implemented policies aim to formulise, modernise, and consequently homogenise urban villages into ""urban-like modern communities"" through the following upgrades: urban infrastructure development, improvement of sanitation conditions, and building facade beautification. However, these approaches for ""environmental enhancement"" were not primarily based on identifying and understanding the real causes of the exhibiting ""environmental problems."" Meanwhile, the inspiration and inheritance of informal rules, especially the involvement and participation of residents for the rehabilitation of urban villages have been entirely overlooked. These two overlooked crucial aspects should be introduced in policy-making and integrated with existing adopted strategies to match local contexts and resolve specific issues. The paper advocates to extend the connotation of the concept of environment from an infrastructural consideration to a mechanism-based and performance-orientation thinking during the making of urban renewal policies. It suggests that environment could be utilised as an inclusive medium to efficiently frame and link multiple aspects in the policies.","Pan, Wenjian","Du, Juan",,,,,,,,,,,,68,LAND USE POLICY,Sustainable urban renewal,Environmental assessment,Urban informality,Urban village,Urban governance,Policy analysis,CITY,REDEVELOPMENT,URBANIZATION,GUANGZHOU,PATTERNS,HEALTH,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2021,"Towards sustainable urban transition: A critical review of strategies and policies of urban village renewal in Shenzhen, China"

The findings identify the practical utilities rooted in the manipulation of plot ratios to fuel the redevelopment projects, and highlight that while the mobilization of non-state resources relieves the government deficit of service delivery, the value-laden gover-nance approach and policy instruments for resource mobilization can also strengthen the unbalanced power relations between actors and have consequences on various aspects.

For adolescents living in multistory housing, public outdoor spaces that support physical activity may play an important role in activity promotion strategies. However, stronger evidence for a relation between the built environment and adolescent physical activity is scarce.Design: A natural experiment with a pre-experimental design was used with data collected in 2010 and 2012 before and after an urban renewal. Data were analyzed in 2016.Setting/participants: Adolescents aged 11-16 years spending a minimum of 10 minutes daily within a 400-m buffer of the renewal district were included in the analyses, resulting in 354 adolescents at baseline and 319 post-renewal.Intervention: A multicomponent urban renewal project of approximately 35 million Euros in a disadvantaged neighborhood in the capital of Denmark occurred between 2010 and 2012.Main outcome measures: The main outcomes were changes in time spent and physical activity within the area among adolescents, measured by accelerometry (ActiGraph GT3X) and GPS devices (Qstarz BT-Q1000XT).Results: Time spent in the area was greater in 2012 than 2010 with an additional 24.6 minutes per day (p = 0.017). Of this time, 7.8 minutes were spent in light and 4.5 minutes in moderate to vigorous physical activity.Conclusions: The present study indicates that a multicomponent urban renewal strategy in a disadvantaged district has the potential to increase time spent and physical activity in the district for adolescents living in or close to the district.

Considering the extensive application of marketized measures such as the floor-area-bonus and right transformation in Taipei's urban renewal system, we explore the role of the state in rent gap production and the obstacles to realizing sustainable regeneration.

From the micro-level, we select two cases in the old and new districts in Taipei for comparison and find that the sociospatial unevenness has not been balanced but intensified by the property-led renewal since the 2000s.

This paper analyzes the actual demand for urban planning and design, especially urban architecture planning and design under the goal of spatial renewal and development of coastal cities, and analyzes the problems in the field of coastal urban architecture design under the current situation. This research indicates that the marine architecture design for spatial renewal of a coastal city should concentrate on ensuring the unity and functionality of the architectural style, so the design requirements are high. In order to achieve this requirement, the design ability for coastal architecture can be improved by introducing planning methods such as an electronic sand table and brainstorming.","Yao, Zhankuo",,,,,,,,,,,,,1,JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH,Marine architecture,renewal and development,coastal city space,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SUM 2020,The Design of Marine Architecture: A Renewal and Development of Coastal City Space Perspective

These features appear when the objective of such public aid programs is to restore the ex ante distribution of wealth or property values within a blighted neighborhood, while equilibria exhibiting deficient levels of private investment and blight itself can arise when residents accurately anticipate the potential provision of public aid to an affected neighborhood and ex ante investment in private insurance diminishes neighborhood eligibility for such aid. Examples of antipodal equilibria in which urban renewal programs entirely crowd out local private investment or in which neighborhood residents invest in efficient levels of private mitigation illustrate these results, which stand in direct contrast to both traditional explanations of urban blight and to the new ""social-interaction"" models of neighborhood divergence.","Arvan, L","Nickerson, D",,,,,,,,,,,,9,JOURNAL OF REAL ESTATE FINANCE AND ECONOMICS,blight,housing,neighborhood effects,urban renewal,PROPERTY-VALUES,SELF-INSURANCE,RENEWAL,MARKETS,LOSSES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 2006,"Private investment, public aid and endogenous divergence in the evolution of urban neighborhoods"

Despite the similarities, America's urban renewal was an ill-fated federal program in which the local government and downtown business interests co-operated to boost declining inner-cities that were competing with burgeoning suburbs. In contrast, China's redevelopment has been propelled by emerging local elites using decentralized state power to pursue fast growth in rising real estate markets.

Among the most consequential was its catalyzing effect on the historic preservation movement nationwide. While preservation practice at the dawn of the urban renewal era emphasized historic monuments, by its end in the mid-1970s, preservationists were much more concerned with neighborhoods, districts, and larger swaths of urban fabric, thus, becoming relevant to all manner of future city shaping and revitalizing efforts. While this expansion took place nationwide, the paths taken by individual cities varied considerably. Because of its large number of historic downtown residential neighborhoods, and its long involvement with historic preservation, Lexington, Kentucky, provides an ideal case study to explore this transformation, highlighting the ways in which neighborhood associations and local preservation organizations collaborated to set the stage for widespread adoption of local historic districts in the 1970s.","Poole, Lauren A.

However, it is difficult to predict the generation of large-scale demolition waste with high efficiency due to the lack of basic data and technical support. This study aims to propose a hybrid trilogy method for predicting the generation of large-scale demolition waste during urban renewal based on two indicators of waste generation rate (WGR) and gross floor area (GFA). WGR was measured based on on-site measurement and existing industry standard data according to different building types and structure types. Composition and proportion of demolition waste were correspondingly analyzed. GFA was obtained based on image recognition technology and Google Earth. Two hundred buildings were selected as samples to verify GFA accuracy, whose error ranges were mostly controlled within 10%. Finally, prediction of large-scale demolition waste generation in Shenzhen was conducted as a case study during urban renewal for verification of the hybrid trilogy method proposed. Results show that 49.40 million tons of demolition waste will be generated. Findings of this study improve the accuracy and speed of existing prediction methods for large-scale demolition waste, indicating great potential for wide application. The current research provides guidance for demolition enterprises, transportation enterprises, recycling enterprises, and government departments to manage large-scale demolition waste precisely during urban renewal.

It is of great significance to comprehensively understand how urbanization affects the evolution of urban thermal environment for urban ecological safety, environmental quality, and residents health. Based on daily land surface temperature (LST) products of MODIS Aqua satellite in the summer of 2002-2020, we investigated the evolution of urban-rural differences in surface summer thermal environment in Shanghai during 2002-2020 and its response to urban spatial renewal. We used normalized land surface temperature (NLST) and urban heat island ratio index (URI) as the surface thermal environment measurement indicators, by combining vegetation index and impervious surface cove-rage, and used M-K trend analysis and interpretation analysis. The results showed that the linear growth rate of LST in Shanghai was 0.09 degrees C.a(-1) (2002-2020), and that URI showed a trend of first increasing (2002-2010) and then decreasing (2010-2020). The mean summer LST was generally in the order of urban core>suburban>rural. 1.6% of the areas showed a significant cooling trend, of which 54.0% were distributed in the urban core. 39.5% of the regions showed a significant warming trend, of which 77.6% were distributed in the suburban. In general, there were concentrated significant cooling areas in the highly urbanized urban areas, while there was a significant warming trend in the suburban. The transformation from urban expansion to urban renewal was the main reason for the emergence of concentrated and significant cooling areas in the urban.

However, the solutions to this problem have changed over time. Until the mid-1960s, governments had a negative attitude to squatter housing areas and their populations, seeing them as the sources of social ills in the urban system. Thus, renewal was defined as clearance and redevelopment. However, this situation changed in the 1970s, preparing the necessary ground for rehabilitation and upgrading. In contrast, in the 1980s renewal was evaluated in a global context and equaled regeneration. So, following the 1980s, squatter housing areas have again been considered as problem areas which have to be transformed for the capitalization of global interests, in the name of urban rent. These areas could have been transformed into prestige areas to increase the physical and visual wealth of the city. Thus, first with the improvement plans and later with the urban transformation projects, squatter housing areas have been subject to urban renewal for the betterment of urban space. This study aims to compare these two different squatter housing transformation approaches from the point of view of their impact on the physical and social topography of Ankara, the capital city of Turkey.

When tenements dating back to the 19th century and, therefore, containing inadequately equipped flats are being pulled down and replaced by post-modern apartment houses the air of specific quarters is lost, the townscape is completely changed, and the area's inhabitants, mostly members of the lower classes, mainly blue-collar workers, are forced to move out to the suburbs, to the 'villes nouvelles'.Though the 1977 legislative reform granted the residents the right of some participation in the decision process in renewal projects, there is no legal way to prevent the razing of structures not protected as historical monuments.Vienna's centrally organized municipal socialism instituted a wide spectrum of measures aiming at a considerable improvement of the housing conditions in the inner city; in Paris urban renewal measures are mainly carried out by private or semi-private real estate companies.

Evaluating urban metabolic performance is an effective method to meet targets for sustainable development in contemporary urban areas. Neighborhoods, which are regarded as the basic parts of cities, can detail the metabolic structure and interactions from a bottom-up perspective. In consequence, this study proposed an ecoefficiency model which combined emergy synthesis and slack-based measure data envelopment analysis. A case study with questionnaire and statistical data for eight communities in Chongqing, China was used to shed a light on the properties of emergy metabolic flows and eco-efficiency. The results showed that the study communities heavily depended on external resources. Intense communal activities within relatively small geographic areas caused immediate surroundings to suffer from enhanced environmental pressures. Eco-efficiency performances were mostly invalid, and a significant heterogeneity existed among communities. Enhancing the performance of renewable and non-renewable resources whilst also reducing the production of wastes was essential to improve the overall eco-efficiency of local communities. To assist with this, a neighbor-level sustainable renewal framework was proposed which took account of metabolic flows and communal renewal operations.

Most implementation in planning of renewal of industrial land has been mainly conducted at the site level of industrial zones or parks and the larger scale of township planning deserve further attention in China. To fill this gap, this paper aims to investigate the implementation of industrial land renewal for a whole urbanized area under the township master planning.Design/methodology/approach - This study introduces a progressive approach to identify and evaluate the renewal of industrial land in township master planning to move toward a more practical understanding of industrial transition. The authors chose a typical industrialized town, Lijia in Changzhou City, under the development model of ""Southern Jiangsu"" to explain the measurement and assessment framework to identify and evaluate the renewable industrial land. Synthesizing the idea of sustainable development, the authors investigated the renewable industrial land with an econometric model including multiple-indexes of economic, social and ecological aspects, field observations and depth interviews.Findings - The analysis demonstrated the spatial heterogeneity and complex generous structure of industrial land renewal in developing countries. It pointed out the major responsibility of enterprises as main industrial land users and indispensable responsibility of government and society. Following the idea of organic concentration and avoiding one-size-fits-all kind of deal, the master planning of Lijia emphasized the connection of industrial land and the combination of market force, social force and government regulation.Originality/value - With original data and discussion, the authors provide more scientific renewal strategies for planners in sustainable development.","Zhou, Yang","Huang, Xu","Li, Wei",,,,,,,,,,,5,OPEN HOUSE INTERNATIONAL,Industrial land,Urban environment,Renewal,Master planning,Land use value,Socially and Culturally Sustainable Architecture and Urban Design,URBAN-RENEWAL,USE EFFICIENCY,SUSTAINABILITY,TRANSITION,REDUCTION,SHANGHAI,TOWNS,REUSE,CITY,,,,,,,,2020,"Identification and evaluation of the renewal of industrial land in master planning: the case of Lijia, China"

This is also an example of the city government's active promotion of urban renewal plans to improve the city's appearance. Based on this case study and in order to help develop appropriate urban renewal plans, the authors of this paper present the following four conclusions: (1) Taipei has shear-band displaced landform features and the shear banding effect keeps the onsite low-plastic silt alluvium in a soft state; (2) the static and seismic ultimate bearing capacities of building foundations are seriously overestimated due to improper assumptions made in the derivation of the relevant formulas; (3) the old four-floor building would have remained safe during a tectonic earthquake; however, the new twenty-story building does not remain safe during a tectonic earthquake; and (4) landlords will benefit greatly from urban renewal but only if their buildings remain safe after reconstruction. In this case study, the new twenty-story building was found to be unsafe during a tectonic earthquake, and the landlord could therefore risk heavy losses. Therefore, the authors suggest that before a large number of urban renewal plans are promoted in Taipei, the seismic design codes for buildings should be revised so that the static and seismic ultimate bearing capacities of the proposed building foundations can be correctly calculated.

Theoretical underpinnings, rationale, and research methodology used to study the cause and effect of urban redevelopment are presented, Baseline information on the scope and nature of redevelopment in Hong Kong reveals that approximately 1.5 buildings a day have been demolished over the last IO years. Evidence from empirical characterization and correlation analysis by district supports production and class variables as determinants of redevelopment. Projections based on building-demolition data, combined with older housing estate populations, suggest that the rate of redevelopment-led displacement is 14,000 urban dwellers annually. Outlined are renewal policies aimed at social equity in redevelopment, better zoning, and public-private development agency cooperation. Case studies of households experiencing urban renewal show that, in spatial, economic, and social terms, the outcome appears to be favorable for 55% of those displaced. Local influences of cause and outcomes of redevelopment are rapid economic growth, mass public housing provisions. and low unemployment differentials between various locations in the Territory.

The fairness-efficiency solution for both stakeholders in the model is the symmetric Nash bargaining solution with equal information. Urban renewal in China is gradually changing from being efficiency oriented to being fairness oriented, while the issues of vague property boundaries and defective articles remain.

In the context of community's resistance to the project, this article investigates different tactics adopted by the local state to manage residents' discontents. The latter is described in different ""technologies of inclusion"" from compensation to cooperation and empowerment, which could be at the same time pro-market and communitarian. Each tactic was in response to community's discontents with the aim of advancing the renewal plan on the one hand and (peacefully) demobilizing residents on the other hand. The case of Abkouh indicates that grassroots mobilization against urban renewal does not necessarily fall into the dichotomy of either opposing or aligning with neoliberalism, because these two trajectories often converge through the state's technologies of inclusion. This fact limits the collective mobilization capacity of the community and enables the local state to control the particularistic concerns of residents through the use of divide-and-conquer tactics.","Maroufi, Hossein","Baratzadeh, Fatemeh","Sabouri, Atieh",,,,,,,,,,,1,JOURNAL OF URBAN AFFAIRS,Technologies of inclusion,urban renewal,Mashhad,grassroots resistance,neoliberalism,SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS,CIVIC GOVERNMENTALITY,CITY,COPRODUCTION,REGENERATION,POLITICS,STRUGGLE,CITIES,RIGHTS,REFORM,,,,,,,,MAR 2023,"Technologies of inclusion in the frontier of urban renewal: State responses to community resistance in Abkouh neighborhood, Mashhad, Iran"

Empirical findings derive from policy reviews, spatial audits and semi-structured interviews with art producers -elected officials and industry professionals. Findings from Townsville, Gold Coast and Toowoomba reflect international experiences, where public art projects improve spaces and remediate a range of disorderly urban conditions. This paper contributes to international literature on the planning and provision of public artworks as a form of creative placemaking and urban renewal.

Therefore, the efficiency of land utilization and urban renewal suitability has attracted considerable attention. This study provides an urban renewal planning and management model to improve land-use efficiency and revitalize the old city via integrated development. Further, it seeks to strengthen system connectivity and network coordination of natural, social, and cultural resources in the old city and to propose a resource-sustainable development strategy of regionalization, cooperation, and differentiation for historic-area development. Based on the tracking data of tourism routes and the check-in data of tourists, and adopting a social network analysis and space syntax theory, the tourism network structure, node level, and network location are analyzed to differentiate the connections between area and node functions. Finally, an integrated network model of multi-group and multi-core hierarchical structures is proposed to strengthen the overall development. Based on the construction of a spatial network, from the perspective of supporting traffic network and land-resource spatial elements, similarities and differences between the status-quo land use and tourism development demand based on the association network system are compared to help promulgate management strategies for the land use of areas lacking attraction and supporting functions, which is conducive to land-use adjustment. The aim of this study is to provide a new view of the balance between resource sustainability, functional adaptability, and cultural continuation during the process of old-city renewal and to coordinate the relationship between urban conservation and renewal planning and industry development in historic areas.","Liu, Zhao","Wang, Shunyi","Wang, Fang",,,,,,,,,,,35,HABITAT INTERNATIONAL,Old-city renewal,Urban network,Land-use adjustment,Social network analysis,Space syntax,Old Beijing city,CENTRAL FLOW THEORY,BUSINESS DISTRICT,SPATIAL STRUCTURE,TOURISM,TRAILS,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2019,"Isolated or integrated?

The study reaffirms existing research that underscores the importance of enduring social and cultural values in satisfying contemporary users' satisfaction. It also highlights the necessity of adapting innovative design principles to evolving user behaviors and demands. The insights gained from this regional Chinese case study can enrich the literature and holds broader implications for park renewal projects on a global scale.

Given a program that publicly lays down specific, measurable criteria for choosing target neighborhoods - how may the inclusion of neighborhoods that do not meet these criteria be explained, especially when more seriously ""deprived"" neighborhoods were not included? 2. Spatial dimensions of policy actions (i.e. spatial distribution of resources and services shaped according to physical, social and political characteristics of the landscape).The investigation was initially carried out in two development towns, Beit Shemesh and Kiryat Gat, where certain neighborhoods in each city were included in Project Renewal in 1979 and 1982, respectively.

Drawing on four years of ethnographic data, the authors describe social conflicts revolving around homelessness and urban renewal. Moreover, through examining the patterns of economy and polity among sectors with different economic positions in the city, the authors illustrate how ""problematic"" groups of people, such as the homeless, are not antithetical to community. Instead, they are key stakeholders in urban communities with goals, concerns, and desired boundaries similar to those who ""legitimately"" live downtown.","Wasserman, Jason Adam","Clair, Jeffrey Michael",,,,,,,,,,,,36,JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY ETHNOGRAPHY,homelessness,community,urbanism,redevelopment,gentrification,INNER-CITY,POLITICS,INEQUALITY,EXCLUSION,MYTH,,,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 2011,Housing Patterns of Homeless People: The Ecology of the Street in the Era of Urban Renewal

This study illustrates how such an approach can be used to understand the postwar politics of Fargo, North Dakota. Fargo seemed to have all the components necessary for the creation of an urban regime, yet a coherent governing coalition was slow in forming despite the perceived need for downtown redevelopment.

We discuss this through a case study of Sulukule - a historic neighborhood home to a millennium old Roma community located within the historic city center of Istanbul - in the context of the urban renewal project launched by the local municipality. The often cited ""humanitarian"" pretext for the renewal project is ""incorporating"" the Sulukule's poor Roma community into the city and tearing down the borders demarcating their ghetto. Eventually, this discourse of incorporation served to instigate a rapid episode of gentrification in the area. Offering a critical perspective on the municipality's renewal project, and through a discussion of the often conflicting premises of the discourses of the ""right to the city"" and the ""group right to difference,"" this essay argues that intra-urban borders are ""undecided"" separators and calls for policy tools that are responsive to the enabling aspects of bordering processes.

Therefore, quantitative evaluations of the spatial variation of industrial land transformation and its influencing factors are required. This study explores the spatial patterns of industrial land transformation using overlay analysis. Then, it establishes a multinomial logistic regression model to explore their influential factors by collecting empirical data, including of the industrial renewal projects from 2010 to 2018 in Shenzhen, China. The findings show that urban redevelopment practices have profoundly transformed industrial land use in the recent urban renewal process. Market actors implement industrial land redevelopment projects with policy guidance. These actors with diversified redevelopment goals have directly shaped the spatial outcomes of industrial land transformation. A small portion of industrial sites has been transformed into public facilities and open space as required by redevelopment policies. At the same time, the majority have been converted into residential and commercial spaces, as well as new industrial spaces for innovative industries under market orientation. Significant spatial differences in regeneration outcomes exist at the urban level. The regression results indicate that policy and planning regulations, and land ownership, are the critical factors affecting the transformation of urban industrial land into different types of land uses.

In order to avoid unsustainable renewal projects, the evaluation of the sustainability of urban renewal has become a critical procedure. However, there is an insufficient number of relevant studies on ex-ante evaluation compared to a large amount of literature focusing on ex-post evaluation. Most literature does not fully consider the interdependency between the dimensions/criteria of evaluation. How to utilize this to evaluate real cases is shortage. Hence, this study presents an ex-ante decision-making model for evaluating the sustainability of urban renewal projects based on hybrid multiple-attribute decision-making (MADM) from a government perspective, and includes three classical dimensions: economic (D-1), social and cultural (D-2), and environment (D-3), as well as 13 relevant criteria. A case in Taiwan is used to evaluate the potential performance of sustainability and explore improvement strategies. Empirical results from the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) reveal that the social and cultural (D-2) dimension impact the environment (D-3) and economic (D-1) dimensions, with the economic (D-1) dimension being the most impacted by other dimensions. Enhancing transportation (C-5), strengthening the accessibility of various public facilities (C-4), preserving local culture (C-9), increasing greening and open space (C-10), and improving land-use efficiency (C-3) are the criteria in the ""cause"" position, among which strengthening the accessibility of various public facilities (C-4) and improving land-use efficiency (C-3) are considered to be the core of urban renewal project sustainability based on DEMATEL and the DEMATEL-based analytic network process (DANP). The modified VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method indicated that the social and cultural (D-2) and the environment (D-3) dimensions have poor performance. Thereafter relevant improvement strategies and paths are suggested based on an influence network relation map (INRM).

Row_259,"This article examines the changing housing rights regimes amidst the urban renewal currently underway in Shanghai and Mumbai. We examine the policies and regulations that govern residential security and housing tenure, the alteration of policy implementations by electoral and extra-electoral contestations, and the opportunities and strategies for housing activism in each context. We find that political contestations have enabled the construction of a more protective, although precarious, regime in Mumbai than in Shanghai. Despite striking differences, in both contexts housing rights regimes have produced fragmented urban citizenship rights by distributing protections unevenly and inconsistently to urban residents. Finally, although the forms of housing activism differ, residents and civil society groups in both Shanghai and Mumbai employ a variety of strategies in their resistance against demolitions and urban renewal. In the process, they become active urban citizens by articulating their rights to housing and by making new claims to the city.","Weinstein, Liza","Ren, Xuefei",,,,,,,,,,,,118,CITY & COMMUNITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2009,The Changing Right to the City: Urban Renewal and Housing Rights in Globalizing Shanghai and Mumbai

However, few prior studies currently link this theoretical knowledge of street appraisals with operable practices to inform streetscape transformation. This study proposes a proof-of-concept analytical framework that sheds light on the connections between urban renewal and the quantification of streetscape visual traits. By virtue of a million intensively collected panoramic street view images in Shenzhen, China, the image-segmentation technique SegNet automatically extracts pixelwise semantical information and classifies visual elements. The throughput of the eye-level perception of the street canyon is formed by five indices. Additionally, the framework-derived scores (FDSs) are contrasted with the subjective rating scores (SRSs) to report the divergence and coherence between the visually experienced and the quantitative estimated methods. Furthermore, we investigate the spatial heterogeneity of five perception aspects, discuss the variations of the perception outcomes across different function streets, and analyze the net effect of urban renewal projects (URPs) on streetscape transformation. We conclude that this deep learning-driven approach provides a feasible paradigm to depict high-resolution streetscape perception, to analyze fine-scale built environment, and to effectively bridge gaps between the street semantic metric and urban renewal.","Ma, Xiangyuan","Ma, Chenyan","Wu, Chao","Xi, Yuliang","Yang, Renfei","Peng, Ningyezi","Zhang, Chen","Ren, Fu",,,,,,155,CITIES,Streetscape perception,Urban renewal,Visual trait,Semantic segmentation,Street-level imagery,VISUAL ENCLOSURE,VIEW,LANDSCAPE,WALKABILITY,COMPLEXITY,QUALITIES,DENSITY,IMAGES,TREE,,,,,,,,,MAR 2021,Measuring human perceptions of streetscapes to better inform urban renewal: A perspective of scene semantic parsing

The work focuses on the study area of Shenzhen, a high-density urban context with an adequate amount of urban renewal cases and sufficient crowdsourced data. Results indicated that assessments based on the combination of crowdsourced datasets and traditional datasets were accurate and reliable for the residential and commercial land parcels. Furthermore, mass assessments at a fine spatial-temporal scale are viable if introduce crowdsourced datasets due to the cost of obtaining the crowdsourced data is much lower, and the spatial-temporal scale is much finer than investigated or surveyed data.","Liu, Yilun","Zhu, A-Xing","Wang, Jingli","Li, Wenkai","Hu, Guohua","Hu, Yueming",,,,,,,,45,LAND USE POLICY,Urban renewal,Suitability assessment,Crowdsourced data,PBL,Shenzhen,GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION,BUILDING-LEVEL,UNITED-STATES,CITY,DYNAMICS,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2019,Land-use decision support in brownfield redevelopment for urban renewal based on crowdsourced data and a presence-and-background learning (PBL) method

The projects and applications that will enable the cities to reach the standards of the modern world cities have been compulsory. The concept of urban transformation has been put forward in order to solve the problems that arise in the cities and to increase the quality of life of the urban dwellers. The quality of the social and physical structure determines the quality of life in urban areas. Urban natural and cultural landscape value concepts have a broad context which includes many tangible and intangible components of the cities. Urban landscape values are the strongest factors in determining and influencing the quality of urban life due to their scope. In this study, urban landscape values of today's cities on the basis of changing social, ecological, economic, and cultural norms have been determined by gathering the opinion of 13 experts through Delphi technique. In addition, the possible effects of urban renewal applications on urban landscape values were also determined by the data gathered. At the end of the study, 15 natural and 20 cultural urban landscape values were determined and it was concluded that the urban renewal applications have a direct impact on the natural and cultural landscape values of an urban area. As a result of the study, we identified the perception of natural and cultural urban landscape values in the cities under the influence of globalization in accordance with the purpose of the study and discussed the possible effects of urban transformation practices on natural and cultural urban landscape values in cities with a dynamic structure and in constant interaction with the living society. In addition to creating resources for subsequent similar studies, the present study also presents the urban parameters which must be taken into account in all processes including design, implementation, and monitoring stages together starting from the planning stage of urban transformation practices.","Onac, Ayse Kalayci","Birisci, Tanay",,,,,,,,,,,,9,ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,Urban natural and cultural landscape values,Urban renewal,Delphi technique,QUALITY,REGENERATION,LIFE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2019,Transformation of urban landscape value perception over time: a Delphi technique application

Today Eisenhuttenstadt is home to a novel form of urban renewal in which architects and planners look to the socialist past for inspiration as they imagine a new urban future. I examine the history of socialist urbanism as it was implemented in Eisenhuttenstadt, as well as how residents and urban planners came to understand socialist urbanism in the years immediately following German reunification. I then examine an urban renewal program, started in 2014, that explicitly draws on the socialist past. In doing so, I aim to consider the socialist city not as an architectural form but as a set of practices, spatial imaginations, and ethical commitments that can be reanimated even in a capitalist sociopolitical context.","Fox, Samantha",,,,,,,,,,,,,2,JOURNAL OF URBAN HISTORY,urban renewal,post-socialism,late industrialism,Germany,East Germany,cultural memory,architecture,urban planning,2ND WORLD URBANITY,URBANIZATION,ETHNOGRAPHY,POLITICS,CITY,,,,,,,,,,MAY 2022,The Socialist Bratwurst: East German Urbanism and Its Reemergence in the Present

Over the long-term delivery phase, such area-based interventions are often confronted with unforeseen macro-scale urban dynamics related to mobility of people and capital. Since the mid-1980s, Barcelona's municipality has introduced a series of urban renewal programmes - PERIs (Special Plans of Interior Reform) - to deal with deprived neighbourhoods of the city centre suffering from poor housing conditions, inadequate services and infrastructure, and decreasing population. Selective demolition (or esponjamiento) was a key mechanism to create new open spaces in the crowded city centre whilst building new housing stock to relocate families. Urban interventions ranged from large-scale demolition of entire blocks in the Raval neighbourhood to micro-scale demolitions in the Santa Caterina & Sant Pere neighbourhood. This paper seeks to evaluate and compare the social and urban effects of urban renewal programmes in the two neighbourhoods between 1985 and 2009. Longitudinal quantitative analysis is employed to isolate demographic, socio-economic and housing changes, consider the remarkable increase in foreign population unforeseen in the original programmes, and hint at changes in space consumption and housing affordability. Finally, questions on inequality and state-led gentrification are raised, whilst considering dynamics of social and spatial desegregation as well as population substitution and displacement.","Arbaci, Sonia","Tapada-Berteli, Teresa",,,,,,,,,,,,85,EUROPEAN URBAN AND REGIONAL STUDIES,Gentrification,social changes,social inequality,urban renewal,MIXED COMMUNITIES,GENTRIFICATION,RENAISSANCE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2012,Social inequality and urban regeneration in Barcelona city centre: reconsidering success

Row_278,"Approximately 4% of the private buildings in Hong Kong are older than their design lives of 50 years. In addition to the engineering factor, the lack of timely maintenance and proper management has led to a serious problem of building dilapidation in the old urban areas. On account of the high-rise high-density urban setting in Hong Kong, the problem has engendered severe safety and health hazards for the local community. Although different ways of urban renewal or regeneration exist to revitalize the urban environment, it appears that redevelopment is most frequently used. However, the speed of dilapidation would probably exceed the economy's capability of absorbing redevelopments. In addition, redevelopments have detrimental effects on the social fabric and create a large volume of demolition and construction waste that greatly surpasses the current landfill capacity in Hong Kong. A sustainable strategy for urban renewal is, therefore, urgently needed. This research aims to establish an existing profile of the building conditions in Hong Kong and evaluate the suitability of various urban renewal strategies for different buildings through the establishment of a structured building assessment scheme called the Dilapidation Index (DI). In total, 393 private residential buildings randomly selected from 4 districts in Hong Kong were assessed by using the DI. The results indicated that the assessed buildings in Sham Shui Po were more problematic than those in other districts. The results also suggested that physical conditions and management factors play nearly equal parts in differentiating the well-performing buildings from the dilapidated ones. The DI developed in this research is beneficial to different parties with an interest in the quality of the urban built environment because it can help people identify problematic buildings for further actions.

This study examines relationships between the socio-economic statuses of neighborhoods, residents' agreeability to densification processes, and built-morphology preferences, in light of the huge increase in densification projects. This quantitative study included an online survey, conducted via the Qualtrics platform, where participants were presented with nine architectural alternatives in the form of 3D illustrations, with tripled densification levels of the real built environment, presented from a bird's-eye view. The participants were asked to evaluate each alternative in relation to various factors. The study focused on two Tel Aviv neighborhoods, with similar built morphologies yet different socio-economic statuses. The participants included 27 residents from both neighborhoods combined (who also provided background information relating to their socio-economic status), as well as a control group of architecture students. Our findings indicate that residents of lower socio-economic background exhibit more positive attitudes towards urban renewal projects that entail densification. These participants evaluated more of the morphology alternatives as an improvement compared to the current condition, unlike their counterparts from the higher socio-economic neighborhood, who did not perceive any of the alternatives as an improvement. In addition, differences in preferences of building morphologies were seen between the two groups of participants and the control group. This study contributes to the literature by proposing an applicable tool for examining residents' perceptions and preferences regarding urban densification and renewal processes.

Design/methodology/approach- Primary data utilised for this study were collected from all the Estate Surveying and Valuation firms involved in the formal management of commercial properties in Osogbo, Osun-State, Nigeria. Information on the types of urban infrastructure renewed and rental values of 63 commercial properties from 2008 to 2017 were obtained from the sampled estate surveying and valuation firms practicing in the study area. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, analysis of variance and Duncan post hoc test. Findings- The findings showed that physical urban infrastructure such as roads, drainages, water supply and wastes disposal have been upgraded in the study area. Also, the study established that the urban regeneration programme had significant impact on the rental values of commercial properties in Osogbo, arising from the statistically significant difference (F(7, 600) = 22.264, p<0.000) between and within annual rental values of commercial properties in the study area. The annual rental values of the commercial properties also exhibited considerable variation based on the Duncan post hoc test.","Ekemode, B.G.",,,,,,,,,,,,,6,Smart and Sustainable Built Environment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019,"Impact of urban regeneration on commercial property values in Osogbo, Osun State, Nigeria"

Liberal Protestants' missionary brand of urban renewal refocused attention away from the blight and structural obsolescence thought to be responsible for urban decay, and instead brought into focus the cultural pathologies they mapped onto black neighbourhoods. The term inner city arose in this context, providing a rhetorical and ideological tool for articulating the role of the church in the nationwide project of urban renewal.

Row_304,"Conventionally, urban renewal initiated by the private sector is not that different from other trading activities. A developer purchases property rights from the suppliers, who are the property owners of the renewal site, in the open market for a price. Once the deal is done, the suppliers are out of the picture and the developer moves on to the renewal project and starts replacing the existing structure with new buildings for a better use. The developer would prefer not to have the individual owners involved in the renewal process for various reasons such as management problems and profit sharing. From an institutional economic perspective, this is a classic example of market governance structure as the asset is non-specific to a certain extent and the developer is not integrating the supplier (property owners) into the firm. However, on some rare occasions, the developer may adopt a bilateral firm governance structure by incorporating the individual property owners. This, in the context of rural land renewal, has been known as the land readjustment model. Based on the theoretical framework of institutional economics and transaction cost theory, this paper explores the rationale behind the developer and even the public authority choosing to adopt this model in the process of urban renewal by examining two examples in two very different cities in China.","Li, Ling-Hin","Li, Xin",,,,,,,,,,,,45,URBAN STUDIES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2007,Land readjustment: An innovative urban experiment in China
Row_305,"This paper examines the evolution of policing in the townships of Cape Town in the context of a neo-liberalising city. Policing is situated in relation to the shifting meaning of security, the city's emphasis on economic growth and attempts to develop the townships through a law-enforcement-driven urban renewal process. Research conducted in the city suggests that current approaches to urban renewal risk exacerbating social instability by reproducing aggressive forms of policing associated with the apartheid era. Further, as crime is framed as a security threat because of the danger it is thought to pose to market-led growth, urban governance in the townships increasingly takes on the character of a containment strategy. Current security ideology and policing practice create an expanding law enforcement web in which millions of poor residents are caught annually and which appears to undermine the very developmental goals used to justify its expansion.","Samara, Tony Roshan",,,,,,,,,,,,,76,URBAN STUDIES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2010,Policing Development: Urban Renewal as Neo-liberal Security Strategy

The widespread use of urban green plastic cover (GPC) at construction sites and the development of high-resolution satellites have made it possible to extract the spatial distribution of construction sites and provide a basis for environmental protection authorities to protect against dust sources. Existing GPC extraction methods based on remote sensing images are either difficult to obtain the exact boundary of GPC or cannot provide corresponding algorithms according to different application scenarios. In order to determine the distribution of green plastic cover in the built-up area, this paper selects a variety of typical machine learning algorithms to classify the land cover of the test area image and selects K-nearest neighbor as the best machine learning algorithm through accuracy evaluation. Then multiple deep learning methods were used and the top networks with high overall scores were selected by comparing various aspects. Then these networks were used to predict the GPC of the test area image, and the accuracy evaluation results showed that the segmentation accuracy of deep learning was much higher than that of machine learning methods, but it took more time to predict. Therefore, combining different application scenarios, this paper gives the corresponding suggested methods for GPC extraction.","Guo, Wenkai","Yang, Guoxing","Li, Guangchao","Ruan, Lin","Liu, Kun","Li, Qirong",,,,,,,,2,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,Urban renewal,Construction dust,Green plastic cover,Machine learning,Deep learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 2023,Remote sensing identification of green plastic cover in urban built-up areas

Unlike the efforts of Mexico's national government, which focused on the capital's urban core, this project sought to bring public services, including paved streets and sidewalks, water and sewer lines, and parks to the city's marginalized periphery. In studying this campaign, thus far overlooked by historians, the article explores the relationship between urban planning, local and national politics, and inequality in Mexico at the turn of the nineteenth century, arguing that the project's ultimate failure stemmed from both fiscal constraints and political reforms that consolidated power in the capital city under President Porfirio Diaz. It also compares the project to contemporaneous urban renewal schemes elsewhere in the Americas, revealing commonalities between Landa y Escandon's plans, the North American City Beautiful movement, and projects in South America while highlighting important differences.","Konove, Andrew",,,,,,,,,,,,,2,JOURNAL OF URBAN HISTORY,Mexico City,urban renewal,City Beautiful movement,infrastructure,urban politics,public services,Porfirio Diaz,RIO-DE-JANEIRO,SPACE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 2020,"Making a Modern Barrio: Infrastructure and Progress in Mexico City, 1900-1903"

However, the complex effect of global climate change and human activity on the thermal environment evolution under different stages of urbanization remains unclear. In this study, land surface temperature (LST) and a newly -proposed surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) were used to reveal the thermal environment and its evolution during 2002-2020 in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), a rapidly urbanizing region in eastern China. The potential drivers of LST evolution were detected with random forest algorithm. We found that the thermal environment in the YRD had undergone deterioration trends, with the fastest warming trend observed in urban new towns (2.30 degrees C/decade). Although the urban cores had the highest LST, 15.91 % of urban cores exhibited a cooling trend, especially in cities with higher urbanization levels, which was caused by restored vegetation through urban renewal. Population density had the highest positive contributions in urban cores (21.08 %), while anthropogenic heat emissions accounted 21.87 % of the warming trend in urban new towns. Appropriate urban renewal and green infrastructure construction are effective strategies to alleviate the thermal environmental risks in highly urbanized areas.","Zhao, Chengyu","Zhu, Hongkai","Zhang, Shuyi","Jin, Ziwen","Zhang, Yiwen","Wang, Yawei","Shi, Yadie","Jiang, Jianhui","Chen, Xiaoyong","Liu, Min",,,,12,SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY,Heat island intensity,Land surface temperature,Urban -rural difference,Urbanization,Urban renewal,Yangtze River Delta,HEAT-ISLAND,TEMPORAL TRENDS,TEMPERATURE,INTENSITY,CLIMATE,CITIES,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2024,Long-term trends in surface thermal environment and its potential drivers along the urban development gradients in rapidly urbanizing regions of China

Before the 1980s, the state was willing to solely shoulder the job of urban renewal with a wholly supportive financial budget and land appropriation law, while in the 1990s it became financially overburdened due to its renewal policy. Around the year 2000, the state turned towards promoting urban regeneration as a key business model. Through this historical exposition, the Taiwanese story of state transformation in urban renewal policy brings two issues to the fore. The first issue is the learning process concerning the policy of public-private partnership (PPP) initiatives. Trans-border policy mobility connects and constitutes cities, such as Taipei, with other places, such as London, through visits and seminars attended by policy makers and experts. However, policy transferred from abroad is localized in the learning process and used to prioritize the regeneration of public lands in the urban area. The PPP model is transformed in the face of domestic political struggles. The second issue is the social exclusion as a result of property-led regeneration. Rather than playing the role of an impartial institutional moderator, the state privileged landowners and developers and sacrificed the rights of tenants to stay put. By doing so, the state secures political support from landowner-cum-citizens and initiates a political culture of property in which local citizenship is predicated on ownership.","Hsu, Jinn-yuh","Hsu, Yen-hsing",,,,,,,,,,,,33,URBAN GEOGRAPHY,urban policy,urban redevelopment,Public-Private Partnership,state transformation,social exclusion,Taiwan,CHANGING STATE,GENTRIFICATION,GEOGRAPHY,CITY,WORLD,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 1 2013,"State Transformation, Policy Learning, and Exclusive Displacement in the Process of Urban Redevelopment in Taiwan"

Partnerships need participation from the partners, but in the course of participation, power politics emerge and evolve, leading to potential problems for the partnership governance structure. A more interesting issue is whether individual property owners at the renewal site can actually participate in this partnership and contribute to the renewal outcome. This paper shows that despite the call for more public/community involvement, most property owners are risk-averse. That is, when the monetary compensation meets their expectations, there is little incentive for them to participate, especially when the scheme is geared towards the investment profit of the scheme. The paper finds, based on a case study in Hong Kong, that individual owners tend to choose not to participate, with a view to maximizing their benefits. On the other hand, the request for further participation by owners never ceases. This leads to a demand for different forms of participation, such as the flat-for-flat model; the results are yet to be seen.","Li, Ling Hin",,,,,,,,,,,,,10,JOURNAL OF HOUSING AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT,Urban renewal,Partnership,Participation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2012,Urban renewal partnerships-is there really room for participation from individual owners?

This paper contributes to the literature on urban renewal by investigating one dimension of mid-20th century urban change: housing demolition. During the middle decades of the 20th century, government-backed demolition occurred under a variety of housing and transportation programs. Because during those controversial decades no single agency kept track of what was demolished and where, I use a proxy: net loss of housing units by census tract for each decade between 1940 and 1970. I consider three hypotheses: that substandard housing and percent nonwhite in a census tract predicted its likelihood of urban renewal demolition, that the eventual outcome of urban renewal was an increase in higher-density housing, and that there was an improvement in socioeconomic factors. None of the hypotheses are supported. Quantitative, national level analysis of urban renewal has been rare, and much more is needed.Demolicion de Viviendas durante la Renovacion Urbana (Emily Talen) Resumen Mientras continua habiendo mucho debate sobre el legado permanente, mayormente negativo de la renovacion urbana, ha habido muy poco analisis cuantificado a nivel nacional a nivel barrio. Este articulo contribuye a la literatura sobre renovacion urbana al investigar una dimension del cambio urbano de la mitad del siglo 20: la demolicion de vivienda. Durante las decadas de la mitad del siglo 20, la demolicion con apoyo del gobierno ocurrio bajo una variedad de programas de vivienda y de transporte. Dado que durante esas controvertidas decadas ninguna agencia mantuvo registros de que se estaba demolido y donde, uso un proxy: perdida neta de unidades de vivienda por zona censal entre 1940 y 1970. Tomo en consideracion tres hipotesis: que la vivienda sub-estandar y el porcentaje de no-blancos en una zona censal predice su posibilidad de demolicion por renovacion urbana, que el resultado eventual de la renovacion urbana es un incremento en vivienda de alta densidad, y que hubiera una mejora en factores socio-economicos. Ninguna de estas hipotesis tiene sustento. Analisis nacional cuantitativo de la renovacion urbana ha sido inusual, y se necesita mucha mas.","Talen, Emily",,,,,,,,,,,,,29,CITY & COMMUNITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2014,Housing Demolition during Urban Renewal

It will be shown that the strategies adopted for urban development in Genoa relied to a great extent oil new forms of urban governance and that there was a strong notion of tradition and a clear path dependency in the way the urban landscape was reinvented. The adopted instruments of strategic planning neglected the problem areas of internal social fragmentation and immigration, two aspects which have become more important accompanying the process of urban renewal. The restructuring of the port turns Out to be of central importance in understanding Genoa's urban trans formation.

This research begins with definitions of sprawl in Western and Eastern countries, and follows with a dynamic analysis of the social, political, and cultural aspects of sprawl. Three case studies focus on three urban regions in China: Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou.

Initially it reviews how this urban elitisation created the main economic, political and military strongholds of the opposition to the Bolivarian revolution. Then, in contesting it, the urban and Bolivarian revolutions feed each other through women's participation in invited and invented spaces of citizenship. From such spaces, Chacao women in their settler's movement organised struggles of insurgent citizenship to stop elitist urban renewal agendas and develop further forms of insurgent urbanism to conduct an urban renewal from below and establish a New Socialist Community for 600 families.

In response to the extensive redevelopment of New Haven in the 1950s and 1960s, students at the Yale School of Art and Architecture, and especially in the Department of City Planning, marshaled an extensive critique of their expanding university's role in this top-down reconstruction. In the plight of impacted communities they found a parallel to their own frustrations as students. Envisioning a more ""relevant"" design pedagogy that deemphasized the role of the professional and lent greater power to the grassroots, students forced the hand of Yale president Kingman Brewster, Jr., who sought to protect the expertise and bureaucratic process he viewed as essential to liberalism. In their confrontation lay a fundamental shift in the order of urban redevelopment-and thus in the order of the modern city-in the last years of the 1960s.","Goldstein, Brian",,,,,,,,,,,,,10,JOURNAL OF URBAN HISTORY,urban renewal,urban planning,race,liberalism,student movements,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 2011,"Planning's End?

To test that, here we study three decades of changes in air quality and urban renewal, including building composition and green space, in one of the largest and most rapidly -changing megacity clusters in China - the Pearl River Delta city cluster. Our results show that this region underwent substantial urban renewal, where more than 75% of all buildings were constructed over the past 30 years, and similar to 25% of all buildings emerged within the last 10 years. We analyze the spatial -temporal dynamics of airborne particulate matter across the entire region, and compare it to patterns of regional urbanization. We find that increases in the number of buildings exacerbate air pollution, especially during winter. Although our results also suggest that green space helps improve regional air quality, its efficiency diminishes with increasing building age. Collectively, our findings offer new insights into the complex relationship between air quality and urban development, with potentially important management implications, considering that the world's population is predicted to continue to grow in the coming decades.","Zhang, Zhenyu","Zhu, Chongchong","Wang, Long","Chen, Yaping",,,,,,,,,,2,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,Urban renewal,Green space,Air quality,Building age,Megacity,BOUNDARY LINE,CHINA,REGRESSION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 20 2024,Effects of urban renewal on green space: Evidence from airborne particulate matter in a mega city cluster

This helps reveal how urban form evolution impacts the thermal environment. Previous research often used isolated images, ignoring the temporal dimension of thermal infrared and reflectance data from Landsat sensors. Additionally, cost-effective and efficient methods for reconstructing time-series built height are lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, we utilized Landsat time-series data to reconstruct the yearly trends in urban form in Beijing, China, spanning from 1990 to 2020. Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) time series analysis method was used to identify urban growth and renewal years. Employing a reference height for 2020 and logical reasoning method, we reconstructed the annual dynamics of built-up heights, pinpointing years of significant change. Finally, we analyzed the alterations in urban form over the past three decades and their impact on surface temperature changes. Our change detection method achieved an overall accuracy of 86 %, demonstrating its effectiveness in determining the year of change. When compared with data from Lianjia and LiDAR point cloud, our height reconstruction method showed impressive accuracy, with R-2 values of 0.9773 and 0.9526, respectively. Analysis of summer and winter LST values revealed distinct temperature patterns across different building heights, with mid-rise buildings exhibiting the highest LST in summer and low-rise buildings registering the highest LST in winter. During periods of urban growth, both mean and amplitude values of LST increased, while during urban renewal (demolition), they decreased. The date of annual temperature peaks advanced during urban growth but delayed during urban renewal (demolition). Our time series analysis framework offers a new method for understanding the yearly dynamics of urban form and its influence on surface temperature, with potential applications in carbon emission and urban climate modeling studies.","Liang, Ying","Cao, Shisong","Mo, You","Du, Mingyi","Wang, Xudong",,,,,,,,,0,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION,Urban growth,Urban renewal,Height dynamics,Time-series surface temperature,Temporal thermal signature,HEAT-ISLAND,COVER,EMISSIONS,CLASSIFICATION,ALGORITHM,EXPANSION,CHINA,FORMS,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2024,Characterizing annual dynamics of two- and three-dimensional urban structures and their impact on land surface temperature using dense time-series Landsat images

The problems are particularly pronounced in the old, indigenous core areas of the cities, and in the outer spontaneous settlements that accommodate the low-income population. In addition to its health implications, a spatial concentration of low-income population in poor areas of the cities is a possible source of urban crime and urban violence. One is therefore not surprised that the Lagos State Urban Renewal Board, with the assistance of the World Bank, planned to carry out the upgrading of 41 identified low-income settlements in Lagos. Apart from an initial study, the urban renewal process has started in Badia, one of the 41 settlements. This study evaluates the details of the upgrading strategies using primary sources of information collected by a combination of multi-stage and simple random sampling techniques. Inadequate funds, which lead to a narrowing down of the scope of upgrading strategies, are a major finding of the study.

In the context of the people-centered development philosophy, improving the satisfaction of residents is gradually becoming the goal of urban construction and development. Based on the survey data of old residential areas in Ganzhou, China, through the theory of customer satisfaction index (CSI) and partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), the satisfaction model of old residential areas' reconstruction was constructed, and the residents' satisfaction and its main influencing factors were deeply analyzed. The research shows that the overall satisfaction of the reconstruction of old residential areas is between generally and relatively satisfactory, and there is still a large room for improvement. The residents' perception of the quality of the reconstruction of old residential areas is the decisive factor affecting their satisfaction, and the supporting services, public facilities, and government support are the key factors. Neighborhood emotion and community publicity are the effective factors, while residents' expectations is the trace factor. Residents' satisfaction has a negative impact on residents' complaints and a positive impact on policy identity. Age, educational attainment, and monthly average income play a significant moderating role on the influencing factors of residents' satisfaction in the reconstruction of old residential areas. Accordingly, this paper puts forward some policy suggestions to improve the reconstruction of old residential areas, such as improving the matching degree between residents' needs and policy content, strengthening the support for the reconstruction of old residential areas, properly perfecting the appeal mechanism, and innovating the management mode of the reconstruction of old residential areas.","Xu, Shuitai","Chen, Meiling","Yuan, Beifei","Zhou, Yuhui","Zhang, Jiagen",,,,,,,,,2,JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT,Old community renewal,Residents' satisfaction,Customer satisfaction index (CSI),Multigroup analysis,Structural equation modeling (SEM),NEIGHBORHOOD RENEWAL,LIFE SATISFACTION,URBAN-RENEWAL,REGENERATION,MANAGEMENT,CITIES,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 1 2024,Resident Satisfaction and Influencing Factors of the Renewal of Old Communities

Rather than presupposing the critical role of exogenous sources of growth, the aim of the current paper is in exploring empirically the role of local agency in achieving continuity or change through the lens of urban renewal. The data is drawn from three case studies of small, company towns (monogorods) in Russia. The paper concludes that in small towns local actors and endogenous resources play a strong role in achieving positive change. For Russian monogorods there is a tendency to 'merge' different types of agency into an all-embracing local-based leadership which despite the hierarchical power relations allows for certain decision-making autonomy from the central government. The study indicates the need to better account for diverse forms of human agency in various fields of urban development. While conventional approaches tend to prioritize formal hierarchies and derive agency from static positions of authority and economic power, we demonstrate that actors may assume different roles that do not neatly reflect their positions in a fixed and pre-defined manner or narrowly determined economic interests.","Gunko, Maria","Kinossian, Nadir","Pivovar, Galina","Averkieva, Kseniya","Batunova, Elena",,,,,,,,,13,GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES B-HUMAN GEOGRAPHY,Urban renewal,urban development,human agency,small city,company town,Russia,GOVERNANCE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 3 2021,Exploring agency of change in small industrial towns through urban renewal initiatives

With an eye toward contemporary techno-utopian schemes and city-building initiatives, I argue that the basis of technological approaches to urban rule today-a conception of cities as complex socio-economic systems amenable to market-driven optimization-was forged by postwar administrators and technicians in response to the vicissitudes of uneven development. To advance this claim, I examine the history of San Francisco's Community Renewal Program, an early modeling initiative sponsored in the US by the federal government. After situating it in the context of racialized housing markets and policies, I probe the Community Renewal Program's attempt to build a computer model capable of forecasting the effects of redevelopment on housing markets. Though the Community Renewal Program model ultimately proved unviable as a planning tool, expert appraisals of it at the time simultaneously confirmed the characterization of cities as systems of market signals and affirmed in principle the ability to model and thus manage them given an appropriate technological infrastructure. In this light, current municipal design and development projects premised on interactive and remote-sensing technologies express something of the technocratic politics and optimism of the mid-20th century.","Elrick, John W.",,,,,,,,,,,,,0,ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING D-SOCIETY & SPACE,Cities,technopolitics,urban renewal,simulation,neoliberalism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2020,Simulating renewal: Postwar technopolitics and technological urbanism

Questionnaire surveys were conducted in elderly centres and public open spaces in two urban renewal districts. Factor analysis was used to extract the underlying factors in planning of open spaces for the elderly. Through a comparative study of the two districts, having different density, local context, socioeconomic demographics and redevelopment plans, it shows an example of the incomprehensiveness in the concept of ""zone separation"" in which formal differences in the labels of the two districts having same zoning can disguise similarities, thereby calling for a case-by-case study of the details of the two entities.

The spatial pattern of land use transformation with urban renewal and expansion indicates the urban land use structure is gradually optimized during vigorous urban renewal and large-scale development of Pudong area, which will have an active influence on improving urban space landscape and enhancing the quality of the ecological environment. In addition, accuracy analysis demonstrates that PCRMdd represents a robust and effective tool for mixed-pixel classification on remote sensing imagery to obtain reliable soft classification results and endmember spectral information in a noisy environment.","Dai, Xiaoyan","Guo, Zhongyang","Zhang, Liquan","Wu, Jianping",,,,,,,,,,19,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2010,Spatio-temporal pattern of urban land cover evolvement with urban renewal and expansion in Shanghai based on mixed-pixel classification for remote sensing imagery

While the renewal process in most old towns can be attributed to global dynamics, the actors involved in the old town of Tunis are almost exclusively from a local and national level. This paper aims to highlight the processes and strategies for revitalizing the old town of Tunis, to analyse its motives and explain why the renewal process is spurred by local interest instead of global dynamics. For instance, the medina serves primarily as a national symbol.

The case studied here shows how the most vulnerable stakeholders are deprived of benefits in the urban-rural renewal process. Through an analysis of Mantin, a small Malaysian town, the study depicts conflicts among stakeholders. Beyond the traditional stakeholder analysis framework stressing the role of government, developers, and the community affected by development, this research delves into an extended nexus of related stakeholders (the nongovernmental organization sector and media) that complicates the confrontation between the developer with legal right to the land and residents who claim hereditary occupation rights. It also reveals the stance of the government, often neglected in discussions of private-public partnerships. Here, politicians from both opposition and government saw opportunities to gain political advantage from the contest. The result of these stakeholder interfaces was a conflict that dragged on for a protracted period. The events show that the involvement of third-party stakeholders can increase the likelihood of and prolong conflict.

However, the huge funding gap, coupled with the unwillingness of enterprises to participate, has impeded the sustainable development of OCR in China. This issue has become a major practical challenge for the government. This study employed the modified theory of planned behavior (M-TPB) to examine enterprise behavior, focusing on how internal capabilities and external conditions influence their participation. Data was collected from 261 questionnaire surveys, and structured equation modeling was used to analyze the data. Further in-depth interviews were conducted to explain and validate the results from the SEM. The findings illustrate that: (1) the M-TPB offers a more detailed and nuanced explanation of the mechanisms influencing participation behavior; (2) the attitude towards participation is an important factor in shaping the intention to participate; (3) there is a significant negative correlation between perceived behavioral control, which is based on external conditions, and the participation intention; and (4) different types of enterprises show differences in attitude and perceived behavioral control.

However, people found an awkward issue in these cities. Ghost city or empty city appears in many parts of the country. Because of the low qualified urbanization, environmental and social problems become more and more. The traditional blue print master plan is so popular across China that every city drew its own time and time in last thirty years. This top-down urban planning philosophy really stimulated China development. But now, this planning philosophy failed in many planning practices.New urbanization strategy (NUS) is proposed under this background and became one of the hottest words in China. According to NUS, China is undergoing two important processes. One is that urban renewal became the main topic of Chinese urbanization; the other is that private sector became the key driver instead of Top-bottom plan, which mean that urbanization based on new urban area construction is changing to urban regeneration and bottom-up became the main planning approach in this new urban era. Renewal is no longer an urbanization process but a methodology. Instead of traditional blue print plan, renewal philosophy could help the plan more practical. This new planning philosophy eventually forces the government to corporate with or even to rely on the private sector.The paper examined a very special case of Desakota in Chaonan district, Guangdong Shantou. Desakota is a special phenomenon in the urbanization process Asian countries, as well as an important field of urban studies. Desakota almost contains all typical factors of NUS.

Together with the neighborhood's colorful buildings reminiscent of the grand homes of the antebellum South, these elements obscure the fact that the neighborhood as it exists today is the result of a federally funded urban renewal project that razed much of the adjacent Black neighborhood of Needmore and opened up the present-day Cotton District as a space for new investment. In excavating the details of these different elements of the Cotton District's history, our central conceit is that the Cotton District represents what we call a ""nostalgic neo-plantationist pastiche"" produced through the material and symbolic displacement of Blackness and its replacement with both material and symbolic whiteness. By conceptualizing this landscape as constituted fundamentally by white nostalgia for a mythical, bygone era of plantation capitalism, and instantiated through a bricolage of architectural and design styles, we seek to draw attention to the precise ways that this landscape actively (re)constructs the past, rather than simply representing it. At the same time, the case of the Cotton District offers an opportunity to reconsider received wisdom in urban design and planning concerning the historic and contemporary linkages between urban renewal and new urbanism, and racial inequality and urban planning more generally.","Shelton, Taylor","Williams, Brian",,,,,,,,,,,,3,ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS,anti-Blackness,displacement,new urbanism,urban renewal,whiteness,NEW-YORK,GEOGRAPHIES,PLACE,CITY,COMMUNITY,POLITICS,ATLANTA,SENSE,RACE,,,,,,,,,2023,"Making the Cotton District (White): Urban Renewal, New Urbanism, and the Construction of a Nostalgic Neo-Plantationist Pastiche"

Urbanization that takes place without taking into account these legal and technical bases lead to the emergence of informal, risky and dysfunctional settlements. Over time, these settlements become increasingly vulnerable due to their failure to meet social and technical requirements, making their sustainability increasingly challenging, and inevitably becoming subjects of urban renewal activities. Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform's archive of satellite images provides temporal monitoring of urbanization on Earth for about 50 years and analysis of changes in the cloud environment. This study investigates whether the GEE platform can use to detect the impact of the areas where settlement activities are carried out without a development plan in the current urban transformation projects in Istanbul. Land use/cover maps classified with the Random Forest algorithm correlate urbanization activities in urban renewal areas with the entry into force date of the spatial plans that guide the settlement. The classification results evaluated in conjunction with statistical tests and spatial plan decisions demonstrate that unplanned urbanization is a serious obstacle to the sustainability of settlements. Additionally, the study results show the performance of the GEE platform in detecting the effects of factors in the urbanization period.

Both, overinvestment, resulting in gentrification, and underinvestment, resulting in deterioration, are processes that have been well analysed in studies on gentrification and rent control. Much less is known about institutions that seek to ensure a balance between overinvestment and underinvestment. Tenancy law maybe one of these institutions.

A special focus is on the position of tenants in urban renewal, especially since urban renewal may result in the relocation of current tenants through the force of law. The legal relationships between landlord and tenant are classified by four ideal typical positions namely short-term contracts, in which security ends with the termination of the contract, long-term contracts, which provide tenants more security of tenure, but which have also provisions to terminate the contract for reasons of urban renewal, protected tenants, who can only be relocated if a suitable alternative dwelling is provided, and informal users, who cannot rely on the safeguard of a rental contract, but have some legal protection based on the European Convention of Human Rights.

Therefore, this study proposes a multi-criteria decision-making process which combines the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and geographical information system (GIS) at site selection phase of urban regeneration on a case study that includes all the physical and social components of the study area as well as focusing on sustaining ecological, economic, and social features.","Sutcuoglu, Gokce Gonullu","Onac, Ayse Kalayci",,,,,,,,,,,,4,ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,Sustainable urban regeneration,Geographical information system (GIS),Analytical hierarchy process (AHP),Site selection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 2022,"A site selection model proposal for sustainable urban regeneration: case study of Karsiyaka, Izmir, Turkey"

This gap is significant, as many residents must vacate their homes for an average of 3-5 years during Shantytown redevelopment, which brings about challenges of renting houses and the associated negative impacts on their well-being before returning to their resettled homes. Therefore, this study focuses on examining the temporary residence arising during Shantytown redevelopment while awaiting resettlement. We selected Heze city as our case study area, which has been through China's most intensive redevelopment between 2016 and 2018 that affected about 1.2 million population. A structured community survey was conducted, and 1035 valid samples were collected. We then applied spatiotemporal analysis and the Random Forest model to examine stability, direction, and distance of temporary residence mobility, along with its influencing factors. Findings reveal that 92.4% of households move just once or twice during the temporary phase, indicating the preference for stable residence. Regarding moving direction, households seek life service centers rather than city centers, and prefer familiar community environments. Furthermore, 74.8% of households resettled within 2.5 km of their original residence, indicating a preference for nearby temporary housing. The built environment emerged as the most critical factor influencing the mobility, followed by family socioeconomic status, while housing costs, surprisingly, having the minimal impact. This study highlights the importance of considering the interim social costs in urban renewal projects and provides valuable insights for housing market regulation and urban planning to mitigate these effects.","Chao, Hao","Xu, Minghui","Jin, Scarlett T.","Kong, Hui",,,,,,,,,,0,APPLIED GEOGRAPHY,Temporary residence,Urban renewal,Residence choices,Shantytown redevelopment,Random forest,MIGRATION,GENTRIFICATION,DESTINATIONS,SELF,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2024,Understanding temporary residential mobility during urban renewal: Insights from a structured community survey and machine learning analysis

This research aims to demonstrate how differences in public ownership and tenure regimes result in notable contrasts in the results of housing rehabilitation. By contrasting a municipal-level programme in Barcelona with a state-level programme in Paris and examining the different intervention strategies for both privately-owned and public housing, the study sheds light on the successes and limitations of each programme. Furthermore, the article analyses the measures implemented to address the long-term effects of these programmes on residential segregation and the right to housing. The research methodology includes a systematic policy review, an examination of programmes' outcomes, and semi-structured interviews.

However, an oversight in post-occupancy evaluation (POE) impedes the comprehensive understanding of NMIR's impact and post-implementation efficacy. This research addresses this gap by leveraging the lens of place value to examine NMIR's outcomes. Using Wuhan, China, as a case study, 10 Delphi consultations and 28 interviews were conducted among five stakeholder groups: local government, planning professionals, academics, community workers, and residents. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation (FCE) were combined to identify and rank potential indicators. A total of 6 primary and 22 secondary indicators were identified. The indicators were derived from four key policy areas-health, society, economy, and environment-highlighting the relationship among NMIR initiatives, their contribution to place quality, and alignment with policy goals. AHP and FCE results reveal substantial enhancements in environmental quality, residential properties, and public infrastructure. Nevertheless, the analysis exposes varied satisfaction levels and divergences in the perceived relevance of indicators among the government, professionals, and the residents, particularly concerning social cohesion. These disparities underscore the layered impacts of NMIR. This research recommends integrating resident feedback with expert insights to enhance place quality in NMIR projects by balancing physical upgrades with social considerations. It also advocates for a continuous, adaptable post-occupancy evaluation system to monitor and support place value over time. This system should be flexible and context-specific, allowing NMIR initiatives to adapt to diverse urban settings globally, thus supporting long-term sustainability and thriving urban communities.","He, Shiyuan","Li, Yu",,,,,,,,,,,,0,LAND,neighbourhood micro-renewal (NMIR),post-occupancy evaluation (POE),place value,China,URBAN-RENEWAL,REGENERATION,SUSTAINABILITY,HEALTH,RESIDENTS,POLICY,CITIES,CITY,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2024,"Understanding Impacts of Neighbourhood Micro-Renewal Through a Lens of Place Value: A Case Study of Wuhan, China"

Row_538,"Urban renewal in Japan has mainly consisted of redevelopment by private capital redevelopment of commercial areas and, in some case, by the public sector. Redevelopment of residential districts has lagged behind due to the predominance of private ownership and complicated development rights relationships. In the midst of this, the redevelopment of low-standard housing environments in the Buraku districts, where the formerly discriminated-against minority, the Burakumin, live is an extremely rare example of housing renewal. The Buraku liberation movement was able to exercise great political power, and large amounts of national funds were invested over a 27-year period in the Buraku as Dowa assimilation projects. Their living environments were remarkably improved, but unfortunately at present apartment building slums, carrying social overtones of ghetto, are reappearing and these are becoming areas where a new class of the poor are gathering to live. Because of splits within the Buraku liberation movement and political opposition, assessment of the value of Dowa assimilation projects is divided, and society tends to evade the issue. Against that background, in recent years creative and self-reliant means of community development that do not depend on national government funds have emerged from within the Down districts.

Why did territorial stigmatisation increase during processes of state-led gentrification? How did the inhabitants of Tarlabasi behave in the face of increased stigma?

Drawing on literature and news stories published by and about the WCO, this essay focuses on political battles the WCO picked with Detroit Mayor Jerome Cavanagh and Wayne State University. The WCO garnered a small measure of political power and managed to alter urban renewal policies-before the WCO's confrontational tactics turned white mainstream press outlets and public opinion against the organization. Ultimately, the WCO's white leadership and race-blind approach to organizing mitigated its effectiveness in the wake of the 1967 Rebellion, when Black leaders confronted racial discrimination, policy brutality, and other systemic issues that continue in present-day Detroit.","Lindner, Anna E.",,,,,,,,,,,,,0,JOURNAL OF URBAN HISTORY,urban renewal,African Americans,Detroit,race,news media,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,"Seeking ""Self-Determination"" in Detroit: Housing, Race, and the Activism of the West Central Organization, 1964-1971"

We argue that common narratives of 'state-led' processes of neighborhood change often overstate, oversimplify or unduly assume the influence of state agencies, especially the Urban Renewal Authority (URA) and other 'usual suspects', obscuring the complex ways that states facilitate and compel the actions and agendas of other actors. By elaborating implications of several specific forms of state action, especially a 2010 amendment to Hong Kong's Land (Compulsory Sale for Redevelopment) Ordinance, we demonstrate that the state in Hong Kong plays many different roles in facilitating neighborhood transformation, creating an uneven geography of state intervention dependent on locally specific factors such as the particularities of architecture, housing types and residential density in different urban areas as well as existing configurations of policy, legislation and infrastructure. These many articulations of the state are of strategic value to a variety of elite interests, from property developers to wealthy residents and international consumers, whose distinct and competing agendas could hardly be so well served by a less dynamic state.","Gerlofs, Ben A.","Poon, Kylie Yuet Ning",,,,,,,,,,,,0,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN AND REGIONAL RESEARCH,China,gentrification,state theory,urban redevelopment,urban renewal,real estate,public policy,urban planning,land resumption,URBAN-RENEWAL,GENTRIFICATION,PROPERTY,DISPOSSESSION,TRANSITION,,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,STATES OF COMPULSION: Reassessing 'State-Led' Neighborhood Change in Hong Kong

Arguably this has been accentuated in recent years as successive governments have privileged private-sector investment in housing property as the key mechanism for delivering housing and a concurrent winding back of direct government support for housing. This has occurred through a period in which urban renewal and flexible planning regulation have become the key focus of urban planning policy to deliver on compact city ambitions in the name of sustainability. There has been a tendency to read many of the higher density housing outcomes as a relatively homogenous component of the housing market. There has been a comparative lack of critical engagement with differentiated spatial, physical and socio-economic outcomes within the higher density housing market. This paper will explore the interactions between flexible design-based planning policies, the local property market and physical outcomes. Different parts of the property development industry produced distinctive social and physical outcomes within the same regulatory space. Each response was infused with similar politics of exclusion and privilege in which capacity to pay regulated both access and standard of housing accessible, opening new socio-economic divisions within Australia's housing landscape.","Troy, Laurence",,,,,,,,,,,,,14,URBAN STUDIES,housing,politics,sustainability,urban design,urban renewal,AUSTRALIAN CITIES,CITY,GENTRIFICATION,REGENERATION,INVESTMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 2018,The politics of urban renewal in Sydney's residential apartment market

Row_566,"In urban contexts, memory and place are inseparable and important for identity formation. The individual and collective memories of city residents link their identity with place identity. Special features in the landscape and urban fabric help residents differentiate between, and connect with the city's identity. The use of collective memory to identify and retain urban identity during urban renewal projects, however, receives less attention than functional and economic investment considerations. This article investigates the importance of urban landscape identity during urban renewal. It postulates that a city's individual and collective memory is important in maintaining its uniqueness in terms of urban landscape identity, but requires economic investment to maintain basic physical comfort and access. A qualitative research approach with photo-elicitation interviews (PEI) was used to investigate the features that activated the memory of the participants and that were important in contributing to the image of Kisumu City, Kenya. There were ongoing and completed urban renewal projects within Kisumu City at the time of the study, which made it a good case study for postcolonial Africa. Twelve residents (as PEI participants), four officials from the County Government, and four professionals were interviewed as key informants. A field investigation was carried out through mapping and photography in addition to an archival review. The study reveals that the old railway station, the port, and the market featured strongly in collective memory as part of historical trade development. Despite the important role of civic and administrative buildings from the colonial era in the formation of memory, place, and identity, there was also a positive response from residents to the 'new look' of the city. The physical upgrade, decongestion and cleaning of the city, its streets and parks as public spaces resulted in greater safety and public use, which was well appreciated from an investment point of view. The study emphasizes the importance of identifying, considering, and retaining the elements that support memory and identity during urban renewal projects as equal in importance to economic development and functionality when considering long-term sustainability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,Acta Structilia,conservation,collective memory,Global South,photo-elicitation interviews,urban renewal,urban landscape identity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024,"Urban memory and identity weighed against economic investment in urban renewal projects: a case of Kisumu City, Kenya"

To understand how planners and elected officials made such extensive use of federal funds in the 1950s and 1960s for public housing and urban renewal, we have to recast the 1940s as a critical period in the formation both of a new urban vision and of a political coalition emboldened to carry it out. Frustrated in their attempts to rebuild in brick and mortar, slum clearance advocates in St. Louis set about redefining the terms of debate over the future of the city itself. They mobilized behind a vision of the city at a crossroads, poised between progress and decay. Yet despite such stark rhetoric, slum clearance was not so much a technological or economic imperative, but a carefully assembled political agenda to remake the urban landscape.","Heathcott, Joseph",,,,,,,,,,,,,31,JOURNAL OF URBAN HISTORY,slum clearance,urban politics,planning,public housing,urban renewal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2008,"National programs and local agendas in the movement to clear the slums, 1942-1952"

Then, by using the methodology of urban historical landscape, some specific methods for updating and designing the old urban area reconstruction of Jingdezhen is put forward, such as the elements of spatial form, urban texture, historical and cultural landscape elements, streets and alleys, the Changjiang River; public facilities and landscape sketches, and so on. A new design method of landscape transformation of old urban area is established. As the renewal method of respecting the urban history and cultural heritage is a very intelligent urban renewal model, it is found that the application of urban historical landscape in the old urban city is reasonable and effective, which is based on the development of the old urban area and pursues the coexistence of protection and development.","Dong, Cui",,,,,,,,,,,,,4,OPEN HOUSE INTERNATIONAL,Urban Historical Landscape,Urban Heritage,The Old Town,Landscape Design,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2019,URBAN HISTORICAL LANDSCAPE CONSTRUCTION METHODS AND DESIGNS: THE CASE OF THE OLD TOWN OF JINGDEZHEN

Recently some have suggested that demolition can have stand-alone regenerative effectsthat is, if blighted housing is demolished, surrounding markets and neighborhoods will heal and regenerate without further intervention. This article challenges this logic by examining neighborhoods in the American Rust Belt where ad hoc demolition has been the predominant urban policy in the past 40 years. In total, there are 269 neighborhoods in 49 cities that have lost more than 50% of their housing since 1970. In aggregate, these activities have led to more housing loss, and affected more land area than even the urban renewal period, yet have not led to market rebound or a decrease in social marginality.","Hackworth, Jason",,,,,,,,,,,,,93,ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A,Disinvestment,urban political economy,demolition,urban decline,SHRINKING CITIES,CITY,GOVERNANCE,DETROIT,RENEWAL,DECLINE,OHIO,TRANSFORMATION,REDEVELOPMENT,ABANDONMENT,,,,,,,,,NOV 2016,Demolition as urban policy in the American Rust Belt

This was where a small business association developed and mounted a relatively successful, although limited, challenge to the redevelopment strategy of the Sheffield Development Corporation, The paper concludes that localised interests, if able to mobilise effectively and to adapt to changing circumstances, can influence elements of urban renewal schemes.","Raco, M",,,,,,,,,,,,,24,URBAN STUDIES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 1997,"Business associations and the politics of urban renewal: The case of the Lower Don Valley, Sheffield"

Visual information helps to outline, understand, and choose sustainable solutions for problems in the design, while visual tools should be able to diminish professional differences and establish a common language. Recent 3D geo-technologies offer a great variety of new tools that significantly enrich visualisation possibilities and allow for flexible switching between different 3D representations. However, studies have indicated that particular representations create different perceptions in professional compared to non-professional individuals. This paper discusses the specifics of urban renewal processes in the Netherlands and investigates recently developed 3D geo-information technology, and more specifically multiple 3D representations, that can support this task. The concept of LOD, which uses five levels of information, was evaluated as a very promising approach to agree on abstractions and representations in the different renewal phases. The study did not reveal a lack of digital possibilities for visualisation, but instead showed that the simultaneous visualisation of the proposed alternatives should be a priority.

Today, even with half of the planned renewal of the Bijlmer completed, the alleged success of this urban revitalisation programme is questionable. Parts of the black middle class did not move out and some are even returning to the Bijlmer; the combination is producing a type of ""black gentrification"", which forces the ""undesirables"" like drug users, homeless people and undocumented immigrants to leave. This revanchist renewal not only benefits the middle and lower-class population of the district, but it also serves the interests of private developers. European revanchism makes the city safe for corporate investment and aims to restore social order as well as stimulating the development of a strong middle class. This paper demonstrates how hard revanchist policies are demanded not only by private developers but also by the middle and lower classes, and they exist alongside soft ""caring"" policies, even for the ""undesirables"".","Aalbers, Manuel B.",,,,,,,,,,,,,57,ANTIPODE,revanchism,urban revitalisation,gentrification,Amsterdam,black middle class,homeless people,modernist urban planning,undesirables,drug use,public space,high-rise flats,HOUSING ESTATES,NEOLIBERAL CITY,GENTRIFICATION,POLICY,MANAGEMENT,URBANISM,STRATEGY,REVENGE,SPACE,,,NOV 2011,The Revanchist Renewal of Yesterday's City of Tomorrow

Row_582,"Mega-events are popular catalysts for launching area-based urban renewal. However, their built legacies are problematic due to a lack of planning. Besides a much-needed shift in mindset, legacy planning methodology holds the key. This chronic issue is gaining renewed attention with the recent rise of new generation hosts such as China where massive event-led construction was fast-tracked in a top-down fashion. What remains less understood is the impact and implications of such a forceful paradigm on legacy planning and urban renewal. This paper aims to address this gap with an in-depth case study of Expo 2010 Shanghai China. The central theme is to investigate how this paradigm has been adopted to a previous dockland selected as the Expo 2010 site and a catalyst for city-branding oriented urban renewal. Data was sourced from 2004 to 2015 from personal observations, strategic policies, planning documents, photo documentation, and meetings and interviews. This study identifies both the merits and drawbacks of this controversial paradigm to caution about its mixed impact on mega-event built legacies. It is concluded that future event cities should shift their mindset from super-developers to guardians of built legacies, and strike a balance between the top-down and bottom-up thinking. A new categorization centering on the legacy planning process is proposed, with guidelines to improve legacy planning methodology for future event cities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Forced relocations tend to be part of urban renewal processes, as it is a common renewal strategy to replace some of the cheap housing stock with more upmarket alternatives. A large inflow of displaced tenants might have negative effects on the receiving neighbourhood. Although this risk is underscored in both societal and scientific debates, very few studies have focused on it. This paper reports on a case study on perceived changes in a Rotterdam neighbourhood in which many displaced tenants had settled. An expert meeting with public sector employees and a questionnaire completed by and in-depth interviews with residents were used to examine whether and, if so, why residents perceive neighbourhood decline when displaced tenants move in. The results show that the residents of the receiving neighbourhood do perceive more neighbourhood decline, and that this is because they are more negative about the development of their neighbourhood's population composition. However, this perception is only partly related to the inflow of displaced tenants. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Row_584,"In many advanced industrialized countries, one trend in housing programs has been to attempt to reduce the intergenerational transmission of poverty and other social problems through the ""de-concentration"" of urban poverty. In this article, we compare two re-location and urban renewal programs in the United States and the Netherlands, that we argue are based, in part, on assumptions about neighbourhood effects. This neighbourhood effects literature contends that living in close proximity to other impoverished people has a negative effect on the behaviour, dispositions, and welfare of low-income individuals, particularly children. Specifically, this article compares the ""Moving to Opportunity for Fair Housing Experiment"" (MTO) in the United States and the ""Bijlmermeer Revitalization Project"" in the Netherlands.The MTO and Bijlmermeer programs have demonstrated that a multifaceted approach to socio-spatial integration can provide significant social benefits to the poor. At the same time, these projects reveal that re-location policies must take into account these groups' specific contexts in order to increase the likelihood of desired outcomes through such programs. The goal of reducing concentrations of poverty in urban centres should include opportunities for re-location, while simultaneously working towards the urban renewal of high poverty urban neighbourhoods. We argue that maintaining political and public support for urban poverty de-concentration programs requires further experimental, qualitative and quantitative research aimed at explaining the complex and non-linear relationship between urban concentrations of poverty and social problems. This would also allow for targeting of de-concentration efforts to improve social and economic opportunities for all. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This new urban politic is considered to offer a pragmatic solution to what has been considered a landscape in social and material decline.

Housing is therefore being consumed as an expression of an image of desire and status and as a commodity form that is distinctive.

The article debunks the conventional wisdom that midcentury clearance and redevelopment strategies galvanized the historic preservation movement. Rather, the Philadelphia case demonstrates that the preservation community adopted a narrow definition of ""historic,"" while a rehabilitation ethic permeated the Planning Commission's conservative approach to renewal, ultimately resulting in the retention of existing buildings, the integration of older fabric with modern infill, and the implicit preservation of much of the city's residential built environment.","Ryberg, Stephanie R.",,,,,,,,,,,,,37,JOURNAL OF URBAN HISTORY,historic preservation,Philadelphia,urban renewal,COMMUNITY,RACE,CITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 2013,Historic Preservation's Urban Renewal Roots: Preservation and Planning in Midcentury Philadelphia

This paper builds upon empirical research from downtown Budapest. Our investigation primarily focused on the interplay of three groups of stakeholders involved in urban renewal: politicians, investors and residents. On the basis of our multi-dimensional analysis, we could identify three main types of upgrading: classical gentrification (with two sub-types), as well as incumbent upgrading and soft forms of revitalisation. In the studied neighbourhoods, a mixture of these forms of upgrading could be identified, reflecting a diversified rejuvenation. Gentrification was spatially limited to poverty ridden neighbourhoods subject to local government organised regeneration programmes. The predominance of soft forms of revitalisation is a function of housing market mechanisms as well as the planning control of local districts, which in general together create a healthy social mix despite pervasive regeneration activities.","Kovacs, Zoltan","Wiessner, Reinhard","Zischner, Romy",,,,,,,,,,,15,GEOGRAFIE,gentrification,urban regeneration,segregation,social-mix,post-socialist cities,NEW-BUILD GENTRIFICATION,RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION,RURAL GENTRIFICATION,SOCIAL MIX,NEW-YORK,URBAN,RENEWAL,LONDON,,,,,,,,,,2015,BEYOND GENTRIFICATION: DIVERSIFIED NEIGHBOURHOOD UPGRADING IN THE INNER CITY OF BUDAPEST

The central idea is to avoid the trap of growth-oriented planning by restructuring the urban landscape around mixed-income, mixed-use clusters. By replacing the current sprawling inefficiency, proponents argue, environmental, equity, and infrastructure efficiency goals can be achieved. Some have worried however, that rightsizing is merely a newly packaged version of urban renewal. I argue that both framings are misplaced. Through a careful consideration of rightsizing plans in five US cities-Detroit, Flint, Rochester, Saginaw, and Youngstown-I argue that austerity urbanism is the more apt way to characterize actualized versions of the idea. Actualized rightsizing lacks the utopian modernism and Keynesian interventionism of urban renewal, and the progressive equity-oriented environmentalism idealized by its proponents.","Hackworth, Jason",,,,,,,,,,,,,107,ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE,rightsizing,austerity urbanism,neoliberalism,URBAN GOVERNANCE,NEW-YORK,DECLINE,CITY,POSTINDUSTRIAL,DETROIT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015,Rightsizing as spatial austerity in the American Rust Belt

Row_631,"China has recently witnessed the rise of long-term rental apartments (LRAs) developed by institutional investors, following various state interventions to promote the institutionalization and financialization of the rental housing sector. As many LRAs are converted and renovated from underused properties, such as industrial buildings, they have become an integral part of the ongoing urban renewal yet remain insufficiently explored. Through the conceptual lens of spatio-temporal fix and state entrepreneurialism, and drawing on a field investigation in Beijing, this study presents three key findings. First, the renovation and conversion of diverse property stocks into LRAs exemplify a spatial fix strategy to defer the crisis resulting from excessive capital accumulation in the housing sales market over the past two decades. Second, financialization, as an effective political-economic instrument to promote LRA development, provides a temporary fix for the mounting capitalist crisis but may generate new crises if not properly regulated. Third, market practices of renovation and financialization are closely intertwined with and deeply influenced by state initiatives. This paper not only reveals a novel practice of urban renewal through the development of LRAs, but also advances the theoretical understanding of spatio-temporal fix under state entrepreneurialism. In the Chinese context, it goes beyond neoliberal endeavors addressing the capital accumulation crisis in the housing sector to mitigate the growing housing affordability crisis and maintain social stability through active state intervention.","Li, Chenxi","He, Shenjing",,,,,,,,,,,,0,GEOFORUM,Long-term rental apartment (LRA),Private rental sector,Urban renewal,State entrepreneurialism,Spatio-temporal fix,Beijing,SPACE,MARKETS,CITIES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,"""Renovate to rent"" as a spatio-temporal fix under state entrepreneurialism: Urban renewal through long-term rental apartment development in China"

The case study of post-World War II urban renewal in San Francisco's Fillmore District permits geographers and other urbanists the opportunity to examine racial formation as a relational process that differentially positioned African Americans and Asian Americans with respect to each other in the redevelopment process. This positioning resulted in differential outcomes for these two communities, even though both had been segregated into this multiracial and multiethnic neighborhood up until the mid-twentieth century and, as a result, shared a common history and mutual geography. This article utilizes archival research, personal interviews, and theories of racialization from ethnic studies and critical race theory literature to examine, as political scientist Claire Kim put it, the ""racial triangulation"" or ""positioning"" of Japanese Americans and African Americans in the Fillmore's redevelopment. I argue that this positioning was a spatial process that located Japanese Americans and African Americans differently with respect to the imagineering behind the district's urban renewal and with respect to the political process behind redevelopment. This spatialized racial triangulation, in turn, intersected with discourses of blight and Cold War Orientalism with the latter discourse eliding differences between Japanese-American spaces and Japan and resulting in the construction of a Japanese Cultural and Trade Center.","Lai, Clement",,,,,,,,,,,,,51,ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS,African Americans,Asian Americans,racialization,racial positioning,urban renewal,WHITENESS,ASIANS,RACE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2012,The Racial Triangulation of Space: The Case of Urban Renewal in San Francisco's Fillmore District

The philosophy behind these area-based policies is that integrated initiatives to deal with the physical, economic and social aspects of these urban neighbourhoods, will lead to the most effective solution. This paper focuses on the 'integrated' aspect of area-based policies in the Netherlands. We find that there is an unbalanced relationship between policies that focus on physical interventions and those that focus on social interventions. Also, findings show that some area-based initiatives claiming to be using an integrated approach are not. 'Integration' is often a term used by policy-makers but not implemented. This lack of integration is partly due to the limited flexibility in decision-making at the local level in dividing funds between and within the different policy fields.","Aalbers, Manuel B.","Van Beckhoven, Ellen",,,,,,,,,,,,20,TIJDSCHRIFT VOOR ECONOMISCHE EN SOCIALE GEOGRAFIE,Integrated urban policy,urban renewal,housing estate,area-based policy,mode of governance,the Netherlands,URBAN GOVERNANCE,BIG CITIES,POLICY,AREAS,,,,,,,,,,,,,2010,THE INTEGRATED APPROACH IN NEIGHBOURHOOD RENEWAL: MORE THAN JUST A PHILOSOPHY?

To reduce the impacts, several studies have proposed strategies based on different planning and design principles. Although some strategies were found to be useful for mitigating air pollution or urban heat island, the simultaneous effects were rarely discussed in the past studies. Therefore, this research tries to develop a framework that is able to evaluate the relative benefits of different mitigation methods on both urban heat island and air pollution, using a scenario-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling method. Six scenarios of different strategies were comprehensively evaluated and compared. It is found that pavement materials and rooftop greening showed more significant effects on reducing the heat island temperature and air pollutant concentration than that of changes in building volumes and water bodies in the study area. In addition, there are differences in mitigation effects on the two impacts, suggesting that careful comparative analysis should always be done before implementing the strategies. The proposed method could be very useful in the process of developing coping strategies for both heat island effect and air pollution in the urban areas.","Ku, Chia-An","Tsai, Shang-Shiuan",,,,,,,,,,,,1,JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SYSTEMS,Heat Island effect,Urban renewal,CFD simulation,Strategy evaluation,GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE,CFD SIMULATION,MODEL,MICROCLIMATE,DENSITY,COMFORT,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2024,Simulating the effects of planning strategies on urban heat island and air pollution mitigation in an urban renewal area

Analyzing Blueprint 15 confirms something that has been noted in many studies-the trend of devolving or offloading urban governance to these sectors-while also, as we will argue, demonstrating some nuanced ways in which shadow state institutions go about their work. In particular, we draw on Scott (1998) to argue that shadow state actors mobilize local, albeit selective memories of urban renewal to make both neighborhood space and populations legible in ways that reinforce their particular governing logics.

The literature concerned with housing displacement focuses on after the fact (ex post) analysis of mobility, hence providing only partial insights to prospective outcomes for residents. In this article, we develop a methodology for predicting before the fact (ex ante) spatial location outcomes for residents facing forced displacement. We ask where in the city will displaced residents locate and how do potential new locations compare to the current one? We apply this methodology to an ongoing urban renewal project in Illinois in order to predict spatial relocation patterns. Our findings show that residents facing forced displacement are likely to relocate to low-priced neighborhoods that are on average as bad or worse off in terms of housing adequacy, accessibility to labor, and shopping. These findings not only bear important implications for urban redevelopment policy, but also help to reveal spatially determined costs of moving which are not factored into current redevelopment impact evaluations.

Row_650,"The paper sorts out the legalization process of the ""historical and cultural district"" concept in China which has a close relationship with the development of urbanization,from the perspective of urban morphology. The renewal strategy of cultural heritage presents different value choices. The top-down renewal model often comes from upper-level socio-economic conditions and lacks bottom-up public participation. The materialized architectural heritage is preserved to the greatest extent while human factors are often overlooked. A series of problems exposed in the opening of the first phase of Qingguo Alley and the establishment of the second phase of the protection plan has triggered reflections on the renewal of the historical and cultural district. The conservative principle of repairing the old as old seems to be the most reasonable strategy. In fact, this is a helpless act in the current reality where the theory of historical district renewal is not yet perfect. The relatively radical renewal strategy and architectural principles of the second phase have exposed the new demands of contemporary consumption and cultural experience. On the premise of respecting the traditional neighbourhood style and spatial pattern texture, adapting to the old with the new is probably a positive attempt. The opening and sharing of cultural heritage require greater inclusiveness, ensuring multiple subjects simultaneously enhancing public participation, dispelling the depth of traditional cultural cognition and enhancing human emotional and physical experience, protecting materialized architectural heritage while actively promoting the innovative development and continuation of intangible cultural heritage.","Song, Jianjian","Zhu, Yichen","Li, Zhenyu",,,,,,,,,,,0,"PRAXIS OF URBAN MORPHOLOGY, PT 2",Urban Morphology,Repairing old as old,Renewal,Qingguo Alley,Bottom-up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023,Repairing the old as old or new - Qingguo Alley Historical and Cultural District Renewal

It shows that private owners are predominantly subsidized in areas with bad infrastructure built in the Founders' period, whereas rehabilitation in the municipal housing stock is oriented on political objectives rather than on blight proper.

We emphasize the agency of long-term residents, arguing that the past and memory play a significant role in how people define place, position themselves vis-a-vis urban interventions, and shape their experiences of urban redevelopment beyond monetary issues, class displacement, physical landscape, and housing policy.","Munoz, Catalina","Fleischer, Friederike",,,,,,,,,,,,7,JOURNAL OF URBAN AFFAIRS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2 2022,"Contentious memories: History and urban redevelopment in Bogota, Colombia"

The need for a three-way cooperation between departments of urban planning and development, environmental affairs and health is now being widely acknowledged. In practice, however, it has to face manifold and serious problems. We suggest that there are basically three essential ""instruments"" which could lead to a new and defined role of health departments in urban development: environmental and health audits, local health profiles and ""health promotion committees"" or similar bodies for closer cooperation at the local level. These three ""instruments"" are described in terms of the present state of development and dissemination by analysing empirical studies from public health research. The results indicate that the ""new role"" of local health services in urban planning and development is presently fulfilled only in a few pilot cases.

Row_689,"In his state of the nation address in 2001, former President Mbeki announced the launch of the Urban Renewal Programme (URP) as an area-based approach to address poverty and underdevelopment in targeted areas, with specific emphasis on improving joint government planning and implementation. The URP focussed on 8 urban townships in the country as 10-year pilot schemes which would pave the way for a development strategy on urban renewal, to be implemented nationally at the end of the ten-year pilot period. In this paper we review the lessons learnt from the URP in Cape Town's Khayelitsha node, focussing specifically on the development of the Khayelitsha CBD. This paper is based on qualitative evidence obtained from the views and perspectives of a segment of programme stakeholders, supported by insights from a wide range of secondary sources, such as key reports on the URP. Six lessons learnt from the case study are discussed. These include the need for a flexible system of land-use management which can respond to both private and public-sector investment and requirements, careful consideration of the approach to informal trade within and in the vicinity of the development precinct, and the introduction of mechanisms to ensure that the spin-offs from private investment accrue to the benefit of local communities. Important elements determining the success of the project are also highlighted; these include addressing the high expectations of employment and skills development as part of the URP implementation process, and the need for dedicated project management resources and a project 'champion', who can engage with a variety of external role players. Finally the paper also reflects on the critical role of public investment and commitment required to leverage private investment and development. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

As a historic and mixed functional urban community, the micro-circulation system of Xi'an Railway Bureau exhibits representativeness and complexity. Based on existing research results and years of follow-up investigations, which concentrate on circulation patterns and inherent organic development requirements of the community traffic micro-circulation system, this paper builds an evaluation index system. Value function method was used to implement the index factor quantitative analysis and comprehensive evaluation. Several related strategies were proposed to improve the organic micro-circulation system of the community, which is based on the analysis of the evaluation, in order to adopt the trend in both increasing urban development and stock updating. The analysis results demonstrate that it is necessary to present guiding renewal strategies on community land, road, people, and the environment for those mixed functional communities which use progressive renewed mode. It compensates the problems of overly strong export-oriented system, which is caused by the lack of organic traffic micro-circulation, so as to achieve the selective opening of community external.

Considering that a large part of the country lies on an earthquake zone, this low-quality building stock is a big threat to their inhabitants. Moreover, this issue can only be eliminated with the renewal of the unsafe buildings. At this point, urban regeneration (UR) projects that are in progress in the country are a powerful tool for providing safe and healthy building stock and environments.

The studies related to neighborhood renewal are mostly focused on its renewal methods and contents. However, to make a significant contribution to the long-term neighborhood development, sustainable renewal for the old residential neighborhoods is crucial. This study aims to identify critical barriers to sustainable neighborhood renewal in China and explore their related inter-active mechanisms. To this end, 19 barriers were identified from comprehensive literature review and interviews with the experts. The relationships between the barriers are testified by fuzzy-DEMATEL method. The results revealed thirteen critical barriers, and among which lack of effective supporting policies is considered as the root cause of unsustainable neighborhood renewal. Besides, lack of public-private corporation mechanism, unequal and opaque information between stakeholders, lack of public participation, low profits of the private sectors, and immature law and regulations are all proved to be important causes. Accordingly, proper countermeasures are suggested to be adopted for future neighborhood renewal projects with the identified influencing paths.

However, these expectations often hide the highly distributive effects of improved accessibility that depend on existing urban hierarchies. This paper challenges the simplistic view of infrastructure renewal addressing uneven geographical development and competitive urbanisation. Focusing on the planning process of Rail Baltic, a key Trans-European Transport Network megaproject, in the secondary city-region of Parnu, Estonia, it explores the constitutive work of imaginaries as structured expectations in shaping urban hierarchies and infrastructural renewal. By triangulating the analysis of planning documents and media accounts with expert interviews, the study outlines the variegated imaginaries of new rail projects at the regional scale. In particular, it makes visible and critiques how existing place-bound elites utilise imaginaries to influence major infrastructure projects in their favour. The findings contribute to understanding the challenges and opportunities of infrastructural renewal in secondary city-regions, and underline the need for a clear municipal strategy beyond equating increased accessibility with local development.","Malk, Mattias",,,,,,,,,,,,,0,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Uneven geographic development,Planning imaginaries,Transport infrastructures,Secondary city-regions,Rail Baltic,MULTIPLE,POLITICS,EUROPE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 2024,"When the first train departs...Understanding the work of imaginaries in infrastructural renewal in Pa<spacing diaeresis>rnu, Estonia"

Yet, empirical evidence of the effects of zoning on land values has been conflicting. This paper empirically evaluates the panel data for a district in which two large-scale commercial properties have been developed in a comprehensive development area (CDA) statutorily rezoned from commercial/residential status on land taken by compulsory purchase by a public urban renewal agency in Hong Kong. A price gradient analysis is used to test the effects of such rezoning. The results show that the effect of the new CDA zoning on the prices of housing surrounding the CDA is uncertain. The Pigovian argument for the positive effect of zoning is therefore refuted as a justification for the zone under investigation, and the meaning of the finding for urban renewal planning is discussed. Some urban design factors that may have contributed to the failure of the projects are also discussed.","Lai, Lawrence W. C.","Chau, Kwong Wing","Yiu, Edward C. Y.","Wong, Kelvin S.

The study reveals that participants focused on visual symbols carrying the narrative of daily life, evoking a positive emotional response to these elements. The public participation space successfully establishes a homey atmosphere and achieves the affective reproduction of residents through the creation of its physical environment, residents' embodied practices within it, and negotiated interactions among different subjects.

Findings indicate that change in neighborhood economic status is common, averaging roughly 13 percent per decade; roughly two-thirds of neighborhoods studied in 1950 were of quite different economic status fifty years later. Panel unit root tests for 35 MSAs indicate that neighborhood economic status is a stationary process, consistent with long-running cycles of decline and renewal. In Philadelphia County, a complete cycle appears to last up to 100 years. Aging housing stocks and redevelopment contribute to these patterns, as do local externalities associated with social interactions. Lower-income neighborhoods appear to be especially sensitive to the presence of individuals that provide social capital.

The analysis of energy consumption arising from these trends offers the potential for optimising built forms and assisting in development decisions for urban renewal to encourage lower energy outcomes. This article describes the application of a model which uses a life cycle approach to the analysis of energy consumption in a residential suburb. The results indicate that the inclusion of embodied energy expended during redevelopment can be substantial and should be considered when modelling future energy consumption scenarios.","Pullen, Stephen",,,,,,,,,,,,,10,URBAN POLICY AND RESEARCH,Life cycle energy,embodied energy,residential urban renewal,LIFE-CYCLE ENERGY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2010,An Analysis of Energy Consumption in an Adelaide Suburb with Different Retrofitting and Redevelopment Scenarios

Development projects included aboveground metro stations, which were characterized by extensive urban blight and had created undesirable physical barriers to movement. The transit-oriented development theory having become popular in the West, many station area development projects promoted this concept, including enhanced pedestrian environments, public transportation use, and mixed-use development. Simultaneously, during the planning and implementing processes, other favorable ideas from the Western world included real estate development and marketing. As of 2014, six station area redevelopment projects had been completed. This study attempts to document the results of these station area redevelopments. No evidence was found that either the pedestrian environments or the efficiency of the public transportation system is improved. On the contrary, there is evidence of profitability-oriented urban planning practices in Seoul. Thus, this study aims to warn against special acts that may have deterred the fundamental purpose of urban planning.

Following stricter building codes, the district underwent significant demolition and construction between 2014 and 2015. We employ construction data and credit card transaction data to analyze the demographic changes. We find that urban regeneration due to building renewal may have diverse context-dependent effects on the demographic tapestry of communities, their culture and history. While some neighborhoods showed positive response to increased local amenities and resulted in reduced mobility outside their local area, leading to greater income segregation from the rest of the city, others behaved in the opposite direction. Similarly, the transformation process has attracted a more educated and higher-income inflow of residents in some neighborhoods compared to others. Herein, we employ new big data and mobility-driven metrics from computational social science such as diversity, loyalty and assortativity to reveal the link between urban regeneration and segregation. Our findings provide important clues and insights to urban planners for developing urban policies leading to neighborhood designs that are more connected to each other (hence reducing segregation) while still offering modern amenities expected by their residents.","Seyedkazemi, Seyedpayam","Dass, Zuhal Ozbay","Ozbay, Ayse Elif Ozsoy","Bozkaya, Burcin","Balcisoy, Selim",,,,,,,,,0,CITIES,Urban regeneration,Gentrification,Economic segregation,Purchase activities,Building renewal,RETAIL FORMAT CHOICE,SEGREGATION,ATTRIBUTES,GENTRIFICATION,NEIGHBORHOOD,PERSISTENCE,DIVERSITY,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,Can financial transactions reveal the change in social fabric triggered by urban regeneration?

Given that socio-economically very heterogeneous nations increasingly host these events, it is necessary to extend the debate and to investigate whether the political, economic and social effects in these countries of the Global South - conventionally labelled as the developing world - can be explained with the festivalisation hypothesis: Are the urban development effects qualitatively comparable and, if so, are they more strongly or weakly pronounced than in the Global North?

Previous studies have not adequately addressed the issue of poor social sustainability. This study aims to address this gap by developing a set of valid and reliable performance indicators for assessing the social sustainability of urban regeneration initiatives in China's Historic Urban Areas (HUAs). Through an extensive literature review and a Delphi survey, critical social sustainability factors facilitating urban regeneration were identified. An assessment tool was subsequently proposed, comprising eight themes, 29 indicators, and a corresponding point-scoring system. Finally, Xi'an was selected as a case study to apply and test the applicability of the tool and to evaluate social sustainability performance to further explore improvement strategies. The results show that adequate housing, housing quality, participation in regeneration initiatives, and safe design were the most critical indicators determining the social sustainability of urban regeneration.

Row_738,"Excessive emissions of CO2 have become an important factor affecting sustainable urban development. In the existing renewal decision-making, few strategies have been formulated with the goal of promoting the lowcarbon development. As a fundamental building block of a city, low-carbon construction in neighborhoods is already the basis for promoting sustainable cities. Therefore, this study develops a carbon accounting methodology and an efficiency assessment model that are applicable at the neighborhood level to measure the carbon emission characteristics and reduction potential. Then, a decision-making framework for sustainable neighborhood renewal is put forward from the perspective of carbon emission mitigation. Through a case study of fifteen communities in Yuzhong District, Chongqing in China, this study reveals the current situation of community CO2 emission and carbon emission efficiency, and formulates the sustainable renewal paths according to local conditions. Results show that 83.16% (1.68E+08 kg) of the CO2 in the study communities comes from energy consumption, and CO2 absorption is only 1.78% (3.62E+06 kg) of the total emission. Meanwhile, the carbon emission efficiency of the fifteen study communities has a significant heterogeneity, with a mean value of 0.7402, and 80% of these communities are ineffective. These communities are ineffective mainly because the resource investment cannot be fully utilized. For example, the average utilization efficiency values for energy, purchased resources, and natural resources are 0.7427, 0.8113, and 0.4384, respectively. Thus, adopting adaptive renewal strategies to integrate the use of resources can effectively promote the construction of low-carbon neighborhoods. In addition, the research results can provide a basis for the organization and management of low-carbon renewal projects and the implementation of plans in other regions.","Cheng, Jianbing","Mao, Chao","Huang, Zhu","Hong, Jingke","Liu, Guiwen",,,,,,,,,24,SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY,Carbon mitigation,Neighborhood renewal,Renewal strategy,Sustainability,Carbon emission,URBAN REGENERATION PERFORMANCE,INDUSTRIAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY,INDICATOR-BASED APPROACH,DECISION-MAKING,CHINA,METABOLISM,SIMULATION,EXPERIENCE,INTENSITY,DYNAMICS,,,,,,,,OCT 2022,Implementation strategies for sustainable renewal at the neighborhood level with the goal of reducing carbon emission

In China, the prevailing option for urban renewal is the Urban Complex pattern, which features a mixed functional composition. However, due to its attributes of overall low urban walkability and high energy consumption, such super urban massing may not inspire an environmentally-friendly consequence or a healthy urban lifestyle among residents. This study adds an environmental dimension to the current debates on ""sustainable urban form"" and ""inclusive and resilient neighborhood typology."" Based on an in-depth survey of the social and morphological characteristics of three representative mixed-use open urban neighborhoods (MOUN) in Shenzhen, this paper examines local-scale urban climate and canyon ventilation capacity performances of the following via on-site measurement: typical urban village (MOUN-Type I), mature open urban neighborhood (MOUN-Type II), and newly-built urban complex (MOUN-Type III). The results reveal that each MOUN type presents its merits and specific environmental problems, and their co-existence within cities can balance deficiencies in an inter-supplementary manner. The paper argues that urban (re)development should follow a multi-path and multi-consequence orientation, in which cities require the co-existence and collaboration of diverse neighborhood types to ensure a more efficient urban operation that strengthens urban adaptability. Even just from an environmental perspective, planners and policy-makers should carefully consider the specificity, continuity, and identity of each urban area situated within cities.

An intended result is increased social inclusion and well-being of residents through public housing de-concentration. In this study, we examined challenges encountered during the process of housing renewal from the perspectives of community-based staff and volunteers. Methods We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with housing and community workers, service managers and community volunteers who were working with residents experiencing housing renewal in an outer metropolitan estate in New South Wales. We analysed the data thematically. Results Seventeen participants were interviewed in a mix of individual and group interviews. Housing workers uncovered substantial resident health and social support needs during housing assessments. Promoting access to services and supporting the mental health and social connectedness of residents into the future were seen as key goals and challenges. However, lack of clarity on which services and community resources would exist in the new neighbourhood at the completion of the renewal project made this more difficult, particularly when supporting the social housing residents who were remaining in the changing community. Conclusions Supporting the mental health and well-being of residents experiencing housing renewal is an important role of community-based workers, volunteers and service providers. This includes facilitating access to health care and other services and promoting social connectedness in the emerging community. Increased clarity on what community resources and services will be available subsequent to redevelopment will assist in these aims. So what?

Prior studies have underlined the promotion of communal participation, whereas collective characteristics and individual intentions of public behavior have been largely neglected. This study investigates determinants of residents' participation intention and behavior in a framework that incorporates the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and the expectation-confirmation model (ECM). Based on structural equation modeling (SEM), the empirical analysis was conducted with questionnaires completed by 443 residents who dwell in a neighborhood undergoing micro-renewal. The results indicated that residents' participatory intention and behavior were predicted by subjective norms, behavioral attitudes, and perceived behavioral control. In addition, perceived usefulness positively affected behavioral intention, whereas the impact of satisfaction was not significant. Furthermore, community attachment could positively moderate the effect of intention on behavior. Accordingly, several targeted managerial implications regarding public participation in NMIR are proposed.

It is characterized by the dual urban-rural structure and it accommodates, to begin with, the monumental housing needs of rural migrants. Although the issues of ViCs are very specific and enormous, they evidently have a lot in common with those of slum areas and dilapidated urban areas in developed and developing contexts, in which there already is a long experience with upgrading or urban renewal operations. Also in this specific context of upgrading and urban renewal, the strategic urban project approach is generally being advocated. It emphasizes vision development, the coproduction by stakeholders and the implementation of actions. Strategic urban projects are the cornerstone of this approach. This paper sketches a conceptual framework for the strategic urban project approach for the sustainable redevelopment of ""villages in the city"" (ViCs) in Guangzhou. It makes an attempt to translate the methodologies of the strategic urban project approach to the Chinese context. Adapting the method to deal with the multi-stakeholder environment and complex issues in ViCs is indeed necessary in order to obtain a sustainable redevelopment of ViCs.

The motivation of policy entrepreneurship in the successful urban renewal projects in Guangzhou was heavily contingent upon the geographically important location of the project site and the historically incidence of hosting the 2010 Asian Games, which forced municipal government to become entrepreneurial and innovative in decision making and income redistribution in order to get things done as quickly as possible. The distinct fashion of policy innovation identified in the case of Guangzhou points to the polymorphous and dynamic nature of policy entrepreneurship and advocates a relational treatment of the strategies and motives of policy entrepreneurs embedded in concrete geographical and historical context.","Hu, Fox Z.

In the process of urban renewal, we should pay attention to the thermal environment effect of urban villages and promote the sustainable development of cities. However, at present there are few studies on the differences of thermal comfort among urban settlements. Taking Shenzhen as an example city, this paper distinguished several scopes such as urban villages, formal settlements and non-urban areas, then analyzed the pattern characteristics of urban thermal comfort by using the Modified Temperature and Humidity Index (MTHI), and finally explored the spatial relationship between thermal comfort and various environmental factors through spatial regression models. The results show that (1) thermal comfort has significant spatial autocorrelation and the thermal environment centers are clustered in built-up areas of Shenzhen city. The overall MTHI of urban villages is relatively the highest, and the dominant thermal comfort level in summer is sultry and hot. (2) According to the Spatial Error Model, the green space coverage represented by NDVI has the strongest mitigation effect on urban thermal comfort, and the building density has an obvious aggravating effect on the muggy environment. Both of them have more obvious effects on the thermal comfort of informal settlements. (3) The current thermal environment of urban settlements cannot be ignored, especially in urban villages. In the process of urban renewal, heat dissipation should be considered emphatically. Increasing urban green area and decreasing building density will help to improve urban thermal environment. The study can provide suggestions for urban renewal from the perspective of improving thermal environment.","Yi, Tengyun","Wang, Han","Liu, Chang","Li, Xuechen","Wu, Jiansheng",,,,,,,,,16,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,Thermal comfort,Urban Village,Modi fied temperature and humidity index,Spatial error model,NDVI,HEAT-ISLAND,INFORMAL SETTLEMENTS,SUSTAINABILITY,ENVIRONMENTS,IMPACTS,NEIGHBORHOOD,SATISFACTION,PERCEPTIONS,INDICATORS,STRATEGIES,,,,,,,,DEC 20 2022,Thermal comfort differences between urban villages and formal settlements in Chinese developing cities: A case study in Shenzhen

By analyzing three village cases in Zhuhai, we found that growth coalition theory overemphasized the increasing alliance between political and business elites at the expense of other actors such as villagers and rural collectives. The Shanchang case indicated the close coalition between the developer and the villagers to appeal jointly for additional rights from the local government. The local government made concessions about acknowledging illegal property rights and increasing allowable floor space to facilitate the smooth implementation of demolition. By contrast, the Lixi and Fuxi case showed that the local government formed a coalition with the rural collective in the demolition and compensation stage and formed an alliance with the developer in the construction stage. The case indicated that the government pursued the long-term goal of improving urban livability and enhancing industrial development apart from advocating property-led growth.

Many municipalities are implementing tree planting programs in efforts to increase tree cover. A detailed understanding of historical changes in land cover can inform urban forest management. I applied a convolutional neural network image segmentation approach to historical aerial imagery to delineate changes in land cover in 1957, 1974, and 2017 in Utica, New York, a small, postindustrial city. The model predicted tree, pavement, and building land cover in each year with overall accuracies ranging from 82-87%. From 1957 to 2017, tree cover declined in many areas and impervious surface cover (buildings and pavement) increased. Tree cover gains largely occurred in uninhabited, natural areas; whereas, the greatest declines in tree coverage occurred in many residential areas following the start of the urban renewal efforts in 1957. Current tree planting efforts targeted at homeowners could drive disparities in future tree cover since several areas of Utica with low tree have a high proportion of renter occupied homes and a low median household income. Convolutional Neural Network approaches for image segmentation of aerial imagery are a helpful tool in understanding patterns in changes in tree and impervious surfaces. A better understanding of the legacies of historical policies and neighborhood-scale changes in land cover can assist in highlighting priorities for urban forest management and justice-oriented urban forestry approaches to urban tree planting.","Kropp, Heather",,,,,,,,,,,,,1,ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,Urban tree cover,Land cover,Impervious surface cover,Historical aerial imagery,Convolutional neural network,POLITICAL-ECONOMY,CANOPY,EQUITY,IMPACT,RACE,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2024,Historical changes in tree and impervious surface cover following urban renewal in a small postindustrial city

Taking Shenzhen city as a case, we investigate the spatial characteristics and the change of the Shenzhen city urban center system from the dimensions of spatial pattern, center level and function uses. Urban centers are identified based on spatial clustering method with the point of interest (POI) spatial data of the city's maps in 2010, 2015 and 2019. The results show that Shenzhen's urban centers have experienced a rapid growth from 2010 to 2019 and urban center system has been expanded from the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) to non-SEZ areas. A polycentric urban spatial structure had been formed in Shenzhen by the end of 2019, and the spatial distribution of identified urban centers within different levels is consistent with the central place theory. The old urban centers are generally superior than the emerging centers in terms of area scale, centrality level and the proportion of public services. But the degree of difference is decreasing over time. In general, the guidance of urban master plans, the implementation of urban renewal projects and the improvement of traffic conditions have played important roles in the formation and evolution of the urban center system in Shenzhen.

Located in Wadi Al-Salib where rapid neoliberal urban renewal schemes hope to raise property values and enact demographic change, these houses are often marketed to upper-class Israeli Jews as ""authentic"". Such branding indicates that the privatization of the Palestinian refugees' houses may also signify privatization of the colonial imagination, and a broader shift of the landscape into a collage of marketable images, echoing an 'aesthetic violence' that evokes past colonial landscapes.

Extensive urban village redevelopment projects (UVRPs) have recently been implemented in China, with the expectation of generating positive socioeconomic and environmental effects. However, social instability has resulted from conflicts over land and informal settlements. In this study, we investigate the factors influencing conflict levels during the UVRP process. Based on data collected from 439 projects in seven Chinese cities, ordered logit regression reveals that UVRPs with a top-down rather than a bottom-up institutional arrangement are more likely to have violent conflicts. Projects implemented with a bottom-up and villager-funded approach involve lower levels of conflict than those with a bottom-up and private developer-funded approach. Other determinants, including factors related to policies, time, and space along with project specificity, also influence the conflict level during the redevelopment process.

To fill this gap, this study develops a redevelopment potential assessment framework including four aspects (benefit, cost, supply, and expectation of redevelopment) and builds a multi-scale redevelopment classification system using GIS and landscape index analysis approaches. Taking a fast-growing city, Chengdu, China as an example, we validate our framework and methods. Simultaneously, three conspicuous aspects in the process of inefficient urban land redevelopment were identified to facilitate decision making in our showcase: (1) Determine the classification and evaluation criteria of inefficient land according to local conditions. (2) Integrate potential assessment into the process of inefficient land database development. (3) Arrange the projects implementation schedule according to redevelopment potential and classification.

Yet, rather than leading to aesthetically beautiful cities characterized by sustainable resource utilization processes, the anthropocentric approach to urban and economic development has created global problems of depletion of natural resources, massive pollution and growing social imbalances within and between nation states. The widely heralded concept of (economically, environmentally, and socially) sustainable development has not yet produced a fundamental rethinking of our patterns of production and consumption. A multi-systems level framework with which to think about sustainable urban development and regeneration is outlined. It is based on an evolutionary perspective of systems and their emergent qualitatively different properties. A distinction between chemical/physical, biological, human/individual, social and cultural systems levels is made. Broadly framed guiding questions at each system's level are proposed as the basis for the development of sustainability criteria and indicators that can be tailored to any type of project in the planning or evaluation stage.

Row_771,"China has experienced rapid urbanization in the last few decades. In this context, housing demolition becomes a challenge involving people's livelihood during the process of urban renewal. As a legacy issue, the governance of informal housing is imminent. Small-property-rights housing (SPRH) refers to long-term, large-scale informal housing built on collectively owned land in China. Although Collectively Owned Land Price Assessment Guidance stipulates that SPRH cannot be demolished forcibly without compensation. However, Land Management Law states that compensation standards depend on local governments, resulting in unfair compensation. By integrating the first-difference model (FDM) and the boundary-fixed-effect model into the hedonic pricing model, this study proposes a model of demolition compensation of SPRH based on market value standard, which takes state-owned land compensation standard and residential land floor price into account. Using the case of Nanjing, this study estimates whether Xingdu Garden's demolition compensation deviates from a reasonable level. The results indicate that compensation is reasonable. Residents can take advantage of compensation to purchase affordable housing, and generous subsidies have significantly improved their living standards. FDM can also offer technical support for assessing the rationality of informal housing compensation.

The idea of a smart city has arisen as one of the potential solutions to this concern. In this study, we have demonstrated how citizen science helps immensely to the growth of a smart city by crowdsourcing data about urban decay. Tehran, the capital of Iran, which is home to the history of many people's social lives, has begun losing some of its vitality. Municipalities have plans for dealing with urban decline and revival, but we indicate that volunteered geographic information (VGI) would be more effective in turning such ideas into practice. According to our research, there are three different types of organizations active in urban renewal: municipalities, civil and urban planning agencies, and organizations that support tourism and cultural heritage. As a result, we provided a system design that outlines the duties that each institution has in relation to urban renewal. In addition, we suggested a service broker with the capacity to publish VGI in order to offer interoperability related to geographic data and services based on spatial data infrastructure (SDI). Beyond that, various types of urban decay, necessary management procedures, the sequence of information in system components, and the volunteer's behavior confronting the system were all specified in the form of an object-oriented design. A prototype system based on state-of-the-art in open-source technologies was developed to test our hypothesis.

Row_789,"In 2017, the Moscow municipality announced the demolition of several thousand remaining Soviet-era, standardised apartments (khrushchevki). Known as the Renovation, the renewal project promises to replace the khrushchevki with new residential districts. Based on fieldwork in Northern Izmailovo, a district targeted for demolition, this article analyses encroaching displacement by foregrounding the temporal experiences of affected residents. Building on literature that explores the political underpinnings of discourse and aesthetics in urban renewal projects, with particular attention to Rancie`re's temporal politics, the article contends that the Renovation depends on the discursive construction of its targets as spatial anachronisms. This renders the Soviet-era housing blocks, and those who live within them, vulnerable to a spectrum of modernising aestheticising interventions-from minor ornamentation to wholesale demolition. Based on ethnographic data, the article shows how the initial stages of redevelopment have altered a local network of benches. For a group of long-standing, elderly residents, these disruptions have instigated more profound reckonings with their own sense of time in/ and space, leading to an understanding that they, too, are seen as anachronistic features of the city. Paying attention to urban materiality on a granular scale, particularly in standardised housing estates, reveals the multifaceted temporalities that inform residents' engagements with the spaces of their home districts. The article argues that doing so counters the exclusionary temporal logic of the discourse of anachronism by denying its ubiquity.

Special attention is given to the potential of GIS for mapping qualitative data representing people's needs and judgments about their residential areas. We conclude with a discussion of future challenges in using GIS techniques in combination with the Internet for social analysis in renewal planning.

Nevertheless, inappropriately chosen screening criteria can result in inefficient resource allocation. This article attempts to empirically justify the selection or eligibility criteria of subsidy schemes for housing rehabilitation in Hong Kong where urban decay has been an age-old problem. It outlines the development of a statistical model designed to identify determinants of the dilapidation level of housing in the city. Based on the results of a dilapidation assessment on 390 multiowned apartment buildings using the Dilapidation Index, the extent to which the residential buildings under investigation were dilapidated was regressed against the eligibility criteria. The results revealed that older and unmanaged buildings were more derelict, with the development scale and rateable value correlated to the dilapidation level.

Drawing on 121 qualitative interviews conducted in seven neighbourhoods in the Paris region, this article focuses on relocation processes triggered by the demolition of social housing. How are these socio-residential changes experienced by those actually being relocated? To answer this question, the paper shows how an analysis of long-term residential trajectories can highlight and nuance the experiences of relocatees. Three broad types of trajectories are defined as an analytical framework for a comprehensive approach of the meaning of relocation and opportunity held by households. It shows how forced relocation can either be a positive step in residential trajectories or merely an adaptation in terms of housing, whether or not the inhabitants actually stay in their neighbourhood or leave it.","Lelevrier, Christine",,,,,,,,,,,,,30,HOUSING STUDIES,Urban regeneration,neighbourhood,forced relocation,trajectories,opportunity,PROGRAMS,MOBILITY,RENEWAL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 1 2013,Forced Relocation in France: How Residential Trajectories Affect Individual Experiences

Row_797,"Four urban ecological design and planning research areas are identified: (1) application of ecosystem services, (2) adaptation of settlements for natural disasters, (3) ecological renewal of degraded urban places, and (4) ability of people to link knowledge to action to affect positive change. Ecosystem services are the benefits humans derive from nature, which, until relatively recently, were not normally valued by traditional economics or, when acknowledged, were regarded as externalities. Through the identification of economic and cultural benefits of ecosystems, higher standards for landscape performance can be established. As our climate continues to change, the number of natural disasters increases, frequently with catastrophic consequences for human settlements. Designers and planners must learn how to develop adaptive strategies to climate change and mitigation strategies for the consequences that result. Most cities include underused, degraded places that are ripe for creative redevelopment. Urban ecology provides a conceptual framework that recognizes the restorative potential of people. However, although knowledge about our environments abounds, we seem limited in our ability to adopt measures necessary to ensure a healthy planet for future generations. Each research area offers prospects for landscape and urban planning.

At a time of great pressure to ""modernise"" the metropolis, efforts are being made to upgrade the alleyways by systematically widening them and regulating the uses to which they are put. Studying this urban renewal project provides a better appreciation of the metropolisation process in the Global South from its ""underside""; that is to say, from its most ""ordinary"" components. By addressing the question of which Ho Chi Minh City alleyways have been upgraded, which have not, and why, this article makes clear that metropolisation is a highly situated process. Most importantly, it addresses the different forces - global and local, morphological and social, economic and political - that shape contemporary urban renewal in Vietnam today. To this end, urban spaces are conceptualised as ""fields of forces"", embodying the contradictory global and local forces at work in the process of metropolisation. I identify the ways in which these forces are combined in each neighbourhood, leading to different outcomes. The article draws on the findings of an extensive ethnographic study conducted over five years (2010-2014) in six alleyway neighbourhoods in pericentral districts of Ho Chi Minh City chosen for their diversity. Such a comparative analysis allows us to go beyond the simplistic vision of metropolisation as a standardising process, instead emphasising the reality of hybrid urbanism.","Gibert, Marie",,,,,,,,,,,,,11,ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE,Metropolisation,urban renewal,alleyways,neighbourhood,Ho Chi Minh City,SOUTHEAST-ASIA,VIETNAM,URBANISM,SAIGON,CITIES,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 2018,Rethinking metropolitan production from its underside: A view from the alleyways of Ho Chi Minh City

The preservation and transformation of these districts is currently the major component of the urban renewal of China. However, there are problems of excessive commercial development or isolated conservation in the existing renewal projects of Historical and Cultural Districts in China. In this context, the study took Nanshi Street, a typical Historical and Cultural District of Ganzhou City, Jiangxi Province, China, as the research object; analysed the current spatial status of the district through the typo-morphological approach; and proposed a renewal design concept through the creation of sharing communities to solve the existing problems of the district, which are the lack of popularity of public spaces, and the abandonment and inactivity of historical buildings. Analysis yields a spatial typology of the district that can be categorized into building, court yard, streets and alleys, and vacant space. Combining case studies, three study sharing methods are proposed, which are Sharing for All, Sharing by Transfer, and Group Sharing. Regenerating the four space typologies of the district by hierarchically using three sharing methods can effectively solve the problem and revitalize the district. The study provides design suggestions for the transformation of Historical and Cultural Districts in China, so that they can truly integrate into the contemporary urban environment, while at the same time connecting with the urban cultural context and expressing urban characteristics.","Tang, Mengying","Yang, Ming",,,,,,,,,,,,0,"PRAXIS OF URBAN MORPHOLOGY, PT 2",Historical and Cultural Districts,preservation,transformation,sharing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023,Research on the Transformation Strategy of Historical and Cultural Districts Based on Sharing Design

Using POI data and spatial analysis methods, the paper studies the clustering characteristics and influencing factors of the explicit and implicit consumption space in the Old City of Nanjing to provide practical implications for urban renewal, and finds that the implicit consumption space grows fast and has strong clustering, and its layout basically follows the traditional commercial location theory. Commercial districts, office buildings and traffic accessibility are the common influencing factors for the distribution of explicit and implicit consumption spaces. Explicit and implicit consumption space influence each other in layout, while implicit consumption space has a stronger dependence on explicit consumption space. The influencing factors for the agglomeration of explicit and implicit consumption space have spatial variations.

Our study proposes a new conceptual frame, focused on the comparison between two notions of heterotopia as theoretical alternatives for the interpretation of cities as social and participatory spaces. The notions we consider may be traced to two key thinkers such as Michel Foucault and Henri Lefebvre, and lay the foundation for alternative analytical paradigms of the contemporary urban condition, in relation to artistic and cultural practices in the public space. We draw upon these two alternative readings of heterotopia to explore the implications of the interaction of artistic practices with the urban space as a contested terrain from the viewpoint of power relationships. In our analysis, we find that Foucault's notion of heterotopia is potentially conducive to top-down planning processes and to gentrification. Lefebvre's notion is instead possibly more suited to participatory practices as strategies of reactivation of the right to the city.","Sacco, Pier Luigi","Ghirardi, Sendy","Tartari, Maria","Trimarchi, Marianna",,,,,,,,,,28,CITIES,Heterotopia,Michel Foucault,Henri Lefebvre,Art practices,Participative urban regeneration,CREATIVE CITY,NEW-DEAL,REGENERATION,GENTRIFICATION,GOVERNANCE,RESIDENTS,NETWORKS,POLICY,BERLIN,AREA,,,,,,,,JUN 2019,Two versions of heterotopia: The role of art practices in participative urban renewal processes

It looks at all area of adjacent neighbourhoods in Shanghai, with focus oil one recently redeveloped neighbourhood and one awaiting demolition prior to redevelopment. Their distinct spatial layouts and the lifestyles typical for their residents are found to join in a collage-like manner, thus forming in urban space of diversity and fragmentation. The very joint lines between those complementary neighbourhoods appear as rather dynamic entities, subject to continuous alteration in spite of their commonalities with static barriers. The paper proposes that collision between contrasting socio-spatial settings is - and will most likely remain - archetypical for the emerging Chinese city, as the poor, the old and the past are integral parts of the whole rather than diseases in need of eradication.

Accordingly, many retail premises have been left vacant at the old shopping centres in suburbia. Ethnic retailing has remarkably impacted the urban landscape of the city of Helsinki and spontaneously converted such abundant premises into livable agglomerations, which has contributed to placemaking. The aim of this paper is to study ethnic retailing through two case studies in Helsinki, with an explicit focus on its role in placemaking and the response of urban planning to the phenomenon. The case studies do not report success in planning for diversity. On the contrary, urban renewal policy threatens the existence of two successful agglomerations. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, it demonstrates that ethnic retailing has a structured capacity to deal with market impacts, and the clustering of intercultural entrepreneurship supports its success. Second, the empirical work showed that factors related to space and its usage are already discussed in the theoretical work on placemaking. Third, it argues that the rigid boundaries of planning have prevented the city from perceiving the potential of ethnic retailing and placemaking remains in a blind spot.","Hewidy, Hossam","Lilius, Johanna",,,,,,,,,,,,10,EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES,Ethnic retailing,placemaking,urban renewal,planning for diversity,PLACE-MAKING,URBAN,LONDON,DIVERSITY,GENTRIFICATION,NEIGHBORHOODS,DISPLACEMENT,SEGREGATION,POLICIES,,,,,,,,,,AUG 3 2022,In the blind spot: ethnic retailing in Helsinki and the spontaneous placemaking of abandoned spaces

However, since urban villages are high-level semantic geo-objects and have obscure remote sensing characteristics, it is difficult to obtain fine spatial distribution with good precision from high-density cities using traditional methods. Methods: We propose a novel hierarchical recognition method for urban villages that fuses remote sensing images and social sensing data to finely recognize the urban villages. The method combines the advantages of remote sensing images and social perception data in features. Large- and small-scale information are both considered into the process by using the hierarchical framework. Results: The method provides a new idea for a comprehensive understanding of urban villages at a fine scale. A case study has been implemented in Shenzhen. An urban village distribution with a spatial resolution of 2.5 m is obtained. The accuracy assessment shows that the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient reach 98.68% and 0.807, respectively, indicating the excellent performance of the method. In addition, the gain effects of the hierarchical framework and the fusion of remote sensing images and social perception data are demonstrated, respectively. Conclusions: The results show that both the hierarchical framework and the multi-source spatial data are effective in improving the accuracy of the urban village recognition method.","Chen, D.","Li, Q.","Tu, W.","Cao, R.","Huang, Z.","He, B.","Gao, W.",,,,,,,1,Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023,Hierarchical Spatial Recognition Method for Urban Villages by Integrating Multi-source Geospatial Data

This intra-city comparison shows the aggrandizing pull of the international arena in the shaping of Lincoln Center and the arts it featured in contrast to the local focus and debate that transformed how BAM fit into its Brooklyn neighborhood. The performing arts, bound as they are to a moment fused in space and time, reveal the making of place within grandiose formal buildings as well as outside on the streets that surround them-and it is, perhaps, that tensile connection between stages and streets that informs the relevancy of both the institution and the arts it features. At a time when the suburbs pulled more and more people, the arts provided a counterforce in cities, as magnet and stimulus. The arts were used as compensation for the demolition and re-building of a neighborhood in urban renewal, but they also exposed the more complex social dynamics that underpinned the transformation of the mid-20th century American city from a segregated to a multi-faceted place.","Foulkes, Julia L.",,,,,,,,,,,,,16,JOURNAL OF SOCIAL HISTORY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WIN 2010,STREETS AND STAGES: URBAN RENEWAL AND THE ARTS AFTER WORLD WAR II

While past studies have focused on urban extent mapping, little has been done to reveal changes in vertical structures in built-up areas. In this study, we reconstructed annual urban form dynamics in Beijing, China, from 1990 to 2020, utilizing Landsat time-series data. First, we identified urban growth and renewal years using a temporal segmentation approach. Then, we reconstructed the annual dynamics of built-up heights through logical reasoning, using the reference height in 2020 and the identified changing years. We evaluated the derived dataset and analyzed the urban growth patterns (i.e., upward and outward) over the past three decades. The detected change years are reliable, with an overall accuracy of 88% (& PLUSMN;1 year). Meanwhile, the reconstructed built-up height data showed good agreement with surveyed results (R2: 0.92), with a root mean square error of 2.87 m and a mean absolute error of 2.07 m. Most expanded built-up areas during 1990-2020 were located at the fringe of the central city, and about 16% experiencing multiple changes. Overall, outward growth was prominent in Beijing during the first decade, while upward growth became dominant in most districts thereafter. The proposed framework provides a new way to reveal annual urban form dynamics through time series analysis, with great potential to support relevant studies such as urban climate modeling and carbon emissions studies.","Wang, Yixuan","Li, Xuecao","Yin, Peiyi","Yu, Guojiang","Cao, Wenting","Liu, Jinxiu","Pei, Lin","Hu, Tengyun","Zhou, Yuyu","Liu, Xiaoping","Huang, Jianxi","Gong, Peng",,13,ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING,Built-up,Height dynamics,Urban growth,Urban renewal,Upward,Outward,NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY,EXPANSION,EMISSIONS,CLIMATE,GROWTH,CHINA,TRANSFORMATION,SETTLEMENTS,EXTRACTION,MORPHOLOGY,,,,,,,SEP 2023,Characterizing annual dynamics of urban form at the horizontal and vertical dimensions using long-term Landsat time series data

In order to better understand the pattern of urban expansion, this study adopted random forest algorithm for a long-term urban impervious surface mapping of Wuhan in China. We produced 23-year (1993 to 2015) urban impervious surface mapping data via a dense Landsat time series and the results indicated that the impervious surface area in Wuhan increased rapidly from 4.33% to 15.34% of the total land area from 1993 to 2015. Moreover these map showed that the loss of agricultural land plays a major role in the development of urbanization and impervious surface spread from center area to rural areas, and NDVI showed a higher influence than MNDWI and BCI. Specifically, it was a more important finding that obvious decreasing tendency within the old city zones when they are faced the transformation of old urban renewal. With respect to the formulation of the new urban area, the impervious surface percent can be regarded as an indication of land use because the number and distribution of urban impervious areas have a close and inter-annually correlation with land use/cover types.

Row_839,"Playing as a global city, to maintain the economic dynamics and urban vitality, Hong Kong government would like to take urban regeneration in urban core as a kind of urban growth strategy. The government monopolizes land supply for urban development through the leasehold system, while the redevelopment agency is authorized to take land acquisition for urban redevelopment. The transformation of agency from Land Development Corporation (LDC) to Urban Renewal Authority (URA) reflected the formation of a coalition composed of quasi-public redevelopment agency and private developer, which facilitates land and property resumption in urban redevelopment. The URA-led projects often tend to redevelop obsolete communities into up-market neighborhoods, which possibly enables redevelopment agency and developers to gain more economic benefits from real estate appreciation. Nevertheless, evidences from some large redevelopment projects conducted by URA in Hong Kong such as Lee Tung Street, Longhorn Palace and Kennedy Town have presented that urban redevelopment is closely associated with gentrification triggered by displacement of original neighborhood residents. Hence gentrification in Hong Kong has raised more and more concerns about booming housing price as well as fragmentation of social networks. Through urban regime combined with growth machine approach, this paper will explain the collusion of redevelopment agency and private developers that jointly turns the URA-led redevelopment into neighborhood gentrification. And by examining Kwun Tong Town Centre Project (KTTCP), findings indicate that soaring property value will crowd low-income groups and working classes out from their original neighborhoods; and then those gentrified residential estates will be occupied by rich class. Moreover, increasing rent and operation costs will inevitably eliminate those family-operated small businesses; and then they will be superseded by high-end retailing and services. In this way, urban morphology will be reshaped perpetually through more and more gentrified neighborhoods.",Qian Xingyu,Yin Chengzhi,,,,,,,,,,,,11,OPEN HOUSE INTERNATIONAL,Redevelopment,Gentrification,Neighborhood,Urban Renewal Authority(URA),Developer,CONSUMPTION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2018,FROM REDEVELOPMENT TO GENTRIFICATION IN HONG KONG: A CASE STUDY OF KWUN TONG TOWN CENTER PROJECT

In contrast, in this article I argue that the mythology of the creative class and its positive economic and cultural influence on cities began during the early Cold War. In the 1940s and 1950s, regional alliances of business and elites reinvented scientists as powerful figures on which they anchored their efforts to remake the economies and built environments of U.S. cities. To pursue their plans, these alliances described scientists as finicky, objective, and mobile characters who, if satisfied, would contribute disproportionally as citizens of a region. They enrolled scientists as valuable allies who helped craft a narrative in which urban renewal was universally beneficial for an entire region. In this article I examine how members of Pittsburgh's celebrated regional alliance, the Allegheny Conference on Community Development (ACCD), installed scientists at the heart of their effort to transform the industrial region during the early Cold War. This longer history reveals how regional alliances invented the creative-cities script as a means to facilitate elite and business-driven urban redevelopment.

State plans to regenerate Redfern-Waterloo, to realize its latent potential, far from seeking to displace the socially disadvantaged Aboriginal community and erase its cultural legacy, stress the importance of a continuing indigenous presence. Planning and policy documents generally suggest that Aboriginal people can contribute to, and reap the benefits of, the area's renaissance. This article will explore construction of minority cultures in planning discourse in Sydney and in particular the way indigenous culture and citizenship is delineated in the discourses of urban renewal. The vision of Aboriginal culture (and residual communal presence) is narrow and circumscribed by conventional touristic representations (fine art, dance, and other performance) around national heritage and consumption. This excludes many of the area's youth who, like their counterparts throughout the world, identify more with street culturehip-hop, graffiti art, skateboarding, etc.than with traditional arts/high culture. These activities have little place in the vision for urban renewal. This article will argue that civic booster strategies that fail to recognize the complex and ambiguous character of public spaces and their importance as sites of resistant/underground/avant-garde/youth subcultures will inevitably generate sterile landscapes; their vision of local communal heritage is little more than tokenistic.","Morgan, George",,,,,,,,,,,,,9,JOURNAL OF URBAN AFFAIRS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2012,URBAN RENEWAL AND THE CREATIVE UNDERCLASS: ABORIGINAL YOUTH SUBCULTURES IN SYDNEY'S REDFERN-WATERLOO

As one of the projects of Mayor Lito Atienza's flagship program, Buhayin ang Maynila (Revitalize Manila), the transformation of what is now popularly called The Baywalk from a dark and neglected zone to a brightly-lit concourse has turned out to be the only remaining strip of central public space where commoners flock to enjoy the famous sunset of Manila Bay. Because the re-creation of the Baywalk was done with only cursory policy compliance, save for the political objective of producing an attractive public space, it serves rather as a test case for later developments that could spur the formulation of site-specific urban renewal guidelines. This study sought to describe and record for posterity the actual uses of the Baywalk at the height of its revival, prior to mid-year 2007 municipal elections. The results of the study revealed a mix of intended and unintended uses linked to design of the area, in the absence of an overarching planning framework that might have otherwise controlled its now vigorous albeit weakly-regulated commercial activity. Nevertheless, the Baywalk continues to be a work-in-progress, and the study concludes that its redevelopment persists despite the uncertain policy environment. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The writers adopted the Samuelson-McKean model to value the embedded option of the largest urban redevelopment project in Hong Kong-Kwun Tong Town Center-for its feasibility study. Then housing prices were simulated by using the Monte Carlo simulation. This paper has made a contribution to the real estate investment literature in tracing the plausible optima and adverse outcomes, particularly in situations in which perfect information is not available. The estimated mean value of the project is approximately $31.14 billion, which is around 15% lower than the required value, i.e., the hurdle value of $36.65 billion.

The concern in urban renewal projects is how to sustain place identity, due to changes. In this study, urban landscape identity is the residents' opinions and perceptions of the special features in terms of the physical, meaning, and function aspects that help them differentiate between places. This article postulates that effective public participation is important in identifying, promoting, and maintaining a city's landscape identity in urban renewal projects. The article aims to propose appropriate strategies to develop and preserve urban landscape identity, with emphasis on public participation. At the time of the study, there were ongoing and completed urban renewal projects within Kisumu City, Kenya. A qualitative approach was adopted through interviews with four officials from County Government as key informants, four professionals as experts, and field investigation through mapping and photography. Archival document analysis was carried out based on documents from County Government. The study reveals that Lake Victoria and its scenery, parks, sociocultural activities at public parks, local foods, social interaction at public Central Square, and government buildings contributed to the city's urban landscape identity. The study concludes that, in order to preserve landscape identity, it should be acknowledged in legislations and policies that guide urban renewal and developments, and in public participation processes. The study proposes amendments to the existing planning regulatory controls to guide the preservation of landscape identity in Kisumu.

Therefore, taking 1, 536 blocks (including low-rise blocks (LRB), middle-rise blocks (MRB), and high-rise blocks (HRB)) in Beijing as samples, the performances of boosted regression tree (BRT) and random forest (RF) were first evaluated, and the impacts of 2D/3D urban landscapes on diurnal LST across different block types were explored. The results showed that the mean LST was the highest in MRB (daytime) and HRB (nighttime). BRT performed better than RF in investigating diurnal impacts at the block scale. Vegetation and buildings are the domain factors influencing daytime and nighttime LST in LRB and MRB, while buildings are the domain factor in HRB except at 03:09 (impervious surface).

This has meant that the post-World War II growth of the U.S. health care sector has been deeply intertwined with wider changes in the political economy of American cities. Through an examination of Boston's Tufts-New England Medical Center (T-NEMC) and the surrounding Chinatown neighborhood, this article explores the implications of this relationship by assessing the spatial, economic, and community consequences of the growth of a major urban academic medical center. It treats the history of health care and health care policy as a key part of urban history, using the T-NEMC case to tell a larger story about the role of local and federal policy in transforming urban health care institutions.. T-NEMC deployed federal urban renewal and hospital construction programs to finance an ambitious expansion program designed to allow it to compete with Boston's many prestigious medical centers. T-NEMC faced determined opposition from Chinatown residents who forged political alliances that helped them gain concessions from the medical center, including housing, schools, and health care and community centerseven as their neighborhood was transformed. Ultimately, T-NEMC's larger strategy proved problematic. It took on excessive debt during the period of its expansion and then, in the 1990s, failed to form critical network alliances with other hospitals. The story of health care redevelopment in Boston thus proves to be deeply enmeshed in the changing political economyand politicsof health care in the United States.","McKee, Guian A.",,,,,,,,,,,,,17,JOURNAL OF URBAN HISTORY,Urban hospitals,Boston,Chinatown,Urban Renewal,Tufts-New England Medical Center,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 2016,"The Hospital City in an Ethnic Enclave: Tufts-New England Medical Center, Boston's Chinatown, and the Urban Political Economy of Health Care"

In France, as in many other Western countries, the arrival of the population attracted by new housing developments is seen as a vector for social diversity.

This paper explores how newcomers in new private housing developments experience their new neighbourhood based on qualitative interviews at three study sites in France.

In each of these, they illuminate the values, assumptions, and institutional networks of political and business leaders as they shaped postwar industrial development. The authors demonstrate that local public officials and business leaders in St. Louis articulated a new vision for development based on an emerging metropolitan definition of problems and solutions. In effect, planners responded to inner-city industrial decline by restructuring spatial-economic relations across the metropolitan area. This metropolitan articulation of development and space guided restructuring and yielded a range of tangible yet uneven outcomes on the postwar landscape.","Heathcott, J","Murphy, MA",,,,,,,,,,,,49,JOURNAL OF URBAN HISTORY,metropolitan,redevelopment,policy,technology,tourism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2005,"Corridors of flight, zones of renewal - Industry, planning, and policy in the making of metropolitan St. Louis, 1940-1980"

In order to facilitate the process of SAR, the central state has adopted financial and political tools to encourage local governments to be committed to the SAR scheme.

Some geographers have called this process 'creative destruction'. Two points are pertinent. First, political rhetoric has conventionally been used to legitimise such processes - given that they might otherwise be problematic - 'in the eyes of the people'. Geographers tended to make their own observations of these processes from a critical distance. Second, the state and capital are now making greater use of geographical knowledge in order to buttress their political rhetoric and thereby their legitimisation of programmes of creative destruction.

The study period was January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2002. Data were obtained from the Missouri Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program's (CLPPP) lead surveillance system and St. Louis Demolition Permit Database. Children were considered exposed to a demolition if they had a blood lead test within 45 days of any demolition on a census block. Exposure was classified as both a dichotomous (yes/no) and a categorical (none/one/multiple) variable and was analyzed separately. Linear regression models were developed to determine effects of demolitions on blood lead levels.A total of 1196 children 6-72 months of age living in 395 census blocks were included. 314 (26.3%) were exposed and 882 (73.7%) were unexposed to a demolition.

The optimal design of impervious surfaces (ODIS) is an adaptive solution to urban flooding from the perspective of urban renewal planning. However, existing ODIS models are limited because they do not consider the drainage systems. To address this issue, this study proposes an elastic and controllable optimization model based on assumptions about rainstorm and drainage capacity, nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II), multivariate linear programming (MLP) and soil conservation service curve number model (SCS-CN) in a case study of the old town of Guangzhou city, China. The model not only coupled the drainage systems, but also collaboratively optimized the impervious surfaces and the drainage systems. The results show that the proposed model achieved an optimized efficiency of 5.70 %, which is more than a tenfold improvement compared to existing ODIS models. The study emphasizes that the optimization of the drainage system should be the focus and the optimization of impervious surfaces should be supplementary, and different flood risk areas require different optimization strategies. Furthermore, transforming impervious surfaces into a ""high-low-high"" spatial distribution of impervious surface densities is the optimal design solution for impervious surfaces.

Row_889,"The rent gap theory, a consistent explanation of gentrification in inner-city spaces, sees a growing disparity between capitalized ground rent (CGR) and potential ground rent (PGR) as a catalyst for large-scale property reinvestment and thence gentrification. In historical working-class Santiago's peri-centre (inner city), not only is there a measurable rent gap, but a state-subsidized market in high-density urban renewal based on the accumulation of increased CGR by a few large-scale developers. This article focuses on a low-income municipality of Santiago, which has a local government that aims to attract this market via the liberalization of its local building regulations (seeking to increase the PGR), and deliberate underperformance in a national programme for housing upgrading (seeking to devalue the CGR in spaces previously targeted for renewal). It is observed how, in this city, two forms of ground rent exist, a lower one capitalized by current owner-occupiers (CGR-1) and a higher one capitalized by the market agents of renewal (CGR-2). This is seen as a form of social dispossession of the ground rent and a necessary condition for gentrification. It is concluded that the state-led strategy of urban renewal in Santiago needs to be refocused on more participative forms of distribution of the rent gap.ResumeD'apres la theorie du differentiel de loyer, qui eclaire de facon coherente la gentrification des espaces centraux des villes, l'ecart grandissant entre loyer foncier capitalise (CGR) et loyer foncier potentiel (PGR) constitue un catalyseur de reinvestissement immobilier a grande echelle, donc de gentrification.

Therefore, this paper proposes the concept of community planning resilience based on resilience theory and explores a framework system for evaluating the planning resilience of renewal and transformation community by taking renewal and transformation future community planning of Zhejiang as the research object. At the same time, the technical path of realizing public participation in community planning is explored through the method, mechanism, and technical platform of fuzzy group decision-making. Finally, the feasibility of the aforementioned framework and approach is experimentally explored and verified based on a typical case of renewal and renovation of future community planning. In order to make community regeneration planning more planning resilient, this paper develops a community planning group decision-making study from the perspective of community planning resilience, which provides a new research perspective for the field of community resilience and provides a reference for community planning evaluation and the construction of resilient communities.In China's advancing urbanization, major cities are grappling with diverse risks, necessitating urban planning and governance with heightened resilience to face unforeseen black swan events and foreseeable gray rhinoceros challenges. This urgency is particularly pronounced in community renewal, prompting a vital shift from rigid to resilient planning methodologies. To address this shift, this paper advocates for resilient community construction to be a focal point in both policy and practical implementation of community regeneration. A novel approach utilizing the fuzzy decision-making method is proposed to establish a comprehensive resilient community renewal decision-making technology support system. This system employs a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, integrating an empowerment approach to simplify the complexities of a multicriteria index system.

Row_896,"Sustainable development considered today by the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) as a powerful motivation for urban conservation. Basically, it is a process of urban development based on constant reuse of existing built and natural resources, associated with a low input of energy for adaptation to new requirements conceived in society. This process founded in the local culture, and its capacity to encourage rehabilitation strategy and re-use of historic buildings.Housing renewal of historic areas in the urban conservation strategy, besides being a process of returning a property to a state of utility, is also a tool to preserve architectural and historical significance. The main aim of housing renewal in historic areas is mainly to supply comfort for the residents by improving their living conditions, keep the population live on site, reuse of forgiven traditional crafts, and to raise the cultural awareness of the architectural patrimony and the cultural heritage.This paper explores the dialogue approach as one of the applied techniques in community involvement in rehabilitation of historic areas and mainly in housing renewal projects. The limitations of this technique at different phases of the rehabilitation process are discussed. During survey, design and construction stages, there is a constant interaction, at different levels between technical and social matters, and between professional advisers and building users. The advisers should thus consider both social and technical aspect of the improvement work. The paper conclude that keeping an ethic of conservation and maintaining good quality of work through community involvement are one of the essential measures that the professional team should consider during the rehabilitation process.","Assi, E",,,,,,,,,,,,,0,SUSTAINABLE CITY II: URBAN REGENERATION AND SUSTAINABILITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2002,Limitations to community involvement in rehabilitation of historic areas
Row_897,"It seems with the ever more complex instituting of aggressive neoliberal renewal policies comes an intensified effort to use the language of consensus and civic unity. The post-political debate frames this discussion, and it is from this perspective that we propose a fuller consideration of urban renewal policy, and how these forces are embedded within the narrowing of what has been called the ""properly political"". In bringing together accounts of the dynamic political life of communities and groups of interest who are confronting urban renewal policy in Glasgow, we make a case for recognising an intensification of political articulation, position-taking and action. This recognition comes in response to the argument that we are currently experiencing a post-political consensus and that democracy has been annulled in the process. We see evidence of a Polanyian ""double movement"" in which the construction of consensual publics is such a marked characteristic across different accounts, and how this appears to have opened up new critical spaces of debate and action within the various communities of interest. We therefore openly question the post-political as a condition, or a process, which seemingly unfolds unimpeded. We fear that ""post-political"" runs the risk of becoming a citational practice, that through repetition of the term, a narrowing of political articulation and action within the debate starts to occur.

Row_898,"Dutch municipalities have four instruments to actively assemble landownership. Using these instruments, municipalities have been capable to steer land use developments in both rural and urban areas into the desired directions. Despite the available instruments to assemble land, the necessity for a new act that enables urban land readjustment (ULR) has been discussed several times in the past decades. In 2015, the decision has been made to implement a new act for ULR. Given the situation that ULR will be added to the Dutch land policy instruments, this study explores the main conditions and features that the ULR act needs, to concede to expectations of urban planners, who currently consider the use of ULR. To do this, eleven cases in which ULR is considered as land policy instrument, were analysed. The results show that the expected added value of ULR is mainly related to its ability to share financial costs, gains and risks; to effectively relocate owners and reshape parcels; and to decrease the development costs that occur during active land acquisition. This implies that the main characteristics of regulation on ULR are to enable: 1) the financial division of risks and costs amongst owners, 2) a facilitative role for public parties, and 3) ways to reach agreement on adjusting the property and parcel structuring amongst land owners. Given the current Dutch situation, in which ULR is perceived as an instrument that can be especially valuable in urban renewal tasks with low financial profits, legislation that enables mandatory exchange under strict circumstances is argued to be necessary, to ensure an added value of the instrument upon existing instruments for land assembly.","Holtslag-Broekhof, Sanne",,,,,,,,,,,,,16,LAND USE POLICY,Urban land readjustment,Legislation,The Netherlands,Case study,TOOL,REDEVELOPMENT,NETHERLANDS,INVOLVEMENT,POLICY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2018,Urban land readjustment: Necessary for effective urban renewal?

It contributes by showing the gendered effects of urban transformation on poor women as neoliberalism and conservatism interact. It draws upon two ethnographic studies that reveal women's experiences embedded both in neoliberalism and patriarchy. In neoliberalism, women's participation in the informal job market was promoted as they were made responsible for contributing to mortgage payments, and they were brought into consumption as they were provoked the desire for good homes via furnishing, and in patriarchy, women's traditional roles in social reproduction were demanded in spite of their new roles and responsibilities. The study ponders women's differentiated negotiations with patriarchy which resisted radical challenges when the family and the home framed women's new responsibilities and desires.

Row_900,"Community micro-renewal is an important aspect of urban regeneration. Residents, as the primary users of the community, have become a vital component of community micro-renewals. With the advent of participatory design, designers are no longer the dominant constructors of communities. Residents' participation is essential to current community micro-renewals, but the existing resident involvement still reflects a lack of initiative and an underutilization of potential. Instead, co-creation, in which residents can be deeply involved in the community micro-renewals, is becoming the mainstream. This paper categorizes co-creation models in community microrenewals into three types according to the degree of residents' participation: the co-creation model based on common ideation, the co-creation model for resident participation in the design process, and the co-creation model of resident-led community regeneration. Three corresponding cases in Shanghai, China are analyzed in relation to specific scenarios and typologies. Each case study provides a contextualized interpretation of the characteristics associated with different types of co-creation. Increased residents' participation in the process of co-creation has been found to positively impact residents' identification with community micro-renewals and their intrinsic commitment to sustain them. Furthermore, highly participatory co-creation empowers residents to assume a higher level of responsibility for the project and mitigates the risk of uniformity. The contribution of this paper is to provide a theoretical basis for subsequent practices. Specifically, this research aims to facilitate a comprehensive integration of participatory design methodologies with community micro-renewal initiatives.","Li, Yuxi","Zhang, Shuai","Zhu, Dajian",,,,,,,,,,,9,HABITAT INTERNATIONAL,Community micro -renewal,Residents' participation,Co -creation,Case study,Empowerment of residents,NEIGHBORHOOD REGENERATION,SELF-GOVERNANCE,DESIGN,IDENTITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2023,"Co-creation of community micro-renewals: Model analysis and case studies in Shanghai, China"

Based on an empirical analysis of central Shanghai, the following results were obtained. First, no phenomenon of excessive urbanization exists; on the contrary, compared with global cities, gentrification in central Shanghai is far from over, reurbanization still has more potential, and reindustrialization is exigent. Furthermore, there is still a lack of knowledge, and the outward radiation of urban functions requires immediate enhancement. Second, the population density of central Shanghai as a whole is within a reasonable range; the government should moderately control the population density of the core area of central Shanghai rather than the scale of the population. Third, the targets of improving employment density, increasing the residential land supply, controlling business costs, and optimizing industrial distribution in central Shanghai should be taken into consideration. Lessons from international experience of urban renewal planning should be drawn upon to further improve quality and efficiency, create innovation, and upgrade the city center. Meanwhile, the government should pay attention to moderately expanding the scale of central Shanghai.

These territories have a distinct economic profile that is far from being marginal, but which has a diminishing role for agriculturally related economic activities. From a regionally-based economic approach, the authors argue that these rural areas act as flanking areas for the nearby urban areas, with mutual benefits. Therefore a model representing local economic development in these flanking rural territories can only be relevant if it takes into account this urban-rural partnership, in respect to the territorial identity and cultural features of both these types of areas.The rural-urban partnership should also be an important basis for a rural renewal policy. This policy will undoubtedly contain traditional rural elements stemming from traditional agricultural activities. However, it must also consider economic activities, in particular those of manufacturing and service industries in the countryside. It should also foster those characteristics of the rural environment which can play a decisive role in creating the new opportunities offered by the new localisation factors which are intrinsic to the rise of the new knowledge-based economy.","Cabus, P","Vanhaverbeke, W",,,,,,,,,,,,24,TIJDSCHRIFT VOOR ECONOMISCHE EN SOCIALE GEOGRAFIE,rural,urban,rural renewal,local economic development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2003,The economics of rural areas in the proximity of urban networks: Evidence from Flanders

Row_915,"Background Several epidemiological studies have investigated the effect of the quantity of green space on health outcomes such as self-rated health, morbidity and mortality ratios. These studies have consistently found positive associations between the quantity of green and health. However, the impact of other aspects, such as the perceived quality and average distance to public green, and the effect of urban green on population health are still largely unknown.Methods Linear regression models were used to investigate the impact of three different measures of urban green on small-area life expectancy (LE) and healthy life expectancy (HLE) in The Netherlands. All regressions corrected for average neighbourhood household income, accommodated spatial autocorrelation, and took measurement uncertainty of LE, HLE as well as the quality of urban green into account.Results Both the quantity and the perceived quality of urban green are modestly related to small-area LE and HLE: an increase of 1 SD in the percentage of urban green space is associated with a 0.1-year higher LE, and, in the case of quality of green, with an approximately 0.3-year higher LE and HLE. The average distance to the nearest public green is unrelated to population health.Conclusions The quantity and particularly quality of urban green are positively associated with small-area LE and HLE. This concurs with a growing body of evidence that urban green reduces stress, stimulates physical activity, improves the microclimate and reduces ambient air pollution. Accordingly, urban green development deserves a more prominent place in urban regeneration and neighbourhood renewal programmes.","Jonker, M. F.","van Lenthe, F. J.","Donkers, B.","Mackenbach, J.

As an alternative to depictions of subaltern communities in mobilization as totally 'co-opted' or 'victimized' in neoliberal renewal or as 'unwilling' or 'unable' to produce a collective rights identity, the analysis offers a more complicated picture of community resistance, inactivity, and co-optation. To do this, it adopts a combination of Henri Lefebvre's theory of production of space and Antonio Gramsci's theory of hegemony. The analysis is based on the findings from original ethnographic research on two ethnically distinct working-class neighborhoods under UTP threat in Gebze, a satellite city of Istanbul. It compares communities' affinity with the state-sponsored ideologies (Sunni-Turkish nationalism, neoliberalism) by looking at their ethnic identities and social histories.","Gundogan, Azat Zana",,,,,,,,,,,,,8,URBAN GEOGRAPHY,Urban transformation projects,hegemony,common sense,production of space,Gebze,POLITICS,GENTRIFICATION,CONSTRUCTION,DISPLACEMENT,REGENERATION,GOVERNANCE,HEGEMONY,PROPERTY,RENEWAL,REGIME,,,,,,,,AUG 9 2019,Divergent responses to urban transformation projects in Turkey: common sense and state affinity in community mobilization

It is rather common both in developed and developing countries, that most inner-city neighbourhoods in the initial stage of their formation establish a balance between residential and commercial activities. The prevailing trend toward increasing commercialisation appears to be in most cases the predominant threat to the inner-city poor resulting in uprooting people and dwellings, destroying the micro-business and the informal economy established in the area, gentrification and marginalization of the poor.In what follows, the paper will describe and briefly analyse the causes of the widespread deterioration and decay of inner-cities, conflicting interests and impacts of explicit and implicit public-sector interventions. It advocates that planners and architects should act as educators and enablers, facilitating people to articulate their needs through the renewal of their urban environment.

In this particular case of post-political planning I show how the tenant support for the regeneration programme was manipulated and misrepresented and how choices were closed down for them, leaving them ultimately with a ""false choice"" between a regeneration they did not want or the further decline of their estate. I look at what the estate residents thought/think about the whole process and how they have resisted, and are resisting, the gentrification of their estate. I show revanchist and post-political practices, but ultimately I refuse to succumb to these dystopian narratives, very attractive as they are, for conflict/dissent has not been completely smothered and resistance to gentrification in and around the Aylesbury is alive and well. I argue that we urgently need to re-establish the city as the driver of democratic politics with an emancipatory agenda, rather than one that ratifies the status quo or gets mired in a dystopic post-justice city.","Lees, Loretta",,,,,,,,,,,,,158,ANTIPODE,regeneration,gentrification,mixed communities policy,revanchism,post-political,resistance,GENTRIFICATION,POLITICS,CITY,DISPLACEMENT,RENAISSANCE,GEOGRAPHIES,RELOCATION,SPACE,STATE,,,,,,,,SEP 2014,"The Urban Injustices of New Labour's ""New Urban Renewal"": The Case of the Aylesbury Estate in London"

Available subsurface space will continue to diminish to the point where utilidors (utility tunnels) may become inevitable. Establishing future sustainable strategies in urban underground engineering consists of the ability to lessen the use of traditional trenching. There is an increasing interest in utility tunnels for urban areas as a sustainable technique to avoid congestion of the subsurface. One of the principal advantages of utility tunnels is the substantially lower environmental impact compared with common trenches. Implementing these underground facilities is retarded most by the initial cost and management procedures. The habitual procedure is to meet problems as they arise in current practice. The moral imperative of sustainable strategies fails to confront the economic and political conflicts of interest. Municipal engineers should act as a key enabler in urban underground sustainable development.","Curiel-Esparza, J","Canto-Perello, J","Calvo, MA",,,,,,,,,,,43,SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING ETHICS,urban underground,utility tunnel,sustainable design,DESIGN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2004,Establishing sustainable strategies in urban underground engineering
Row_929,"Institutional arrangements can exert significant impact on land use and the spatial pattern for a region. Since the reform opening, the Pearl River Delta (PRD) area of China has witnessed an explosive amount of bottom-up rural industrialization. This situation has given rise to a fragmented urbanized landscape in peri-urban areas. In 2009 the Guangdong government initiated a comprehensive urban and rural redevelopment plan known as the Three Renewal Policy. This paper begins with an analysis of the double-track land system and their impact on fragmented urbanization in peri-urban areas. Taking a typical peri-urban area such as the Panyu district of Guangzhou as a case study, this paper demonstrates the industrial land redevelopment practice created by the Three-Renewal Policy. The paper argues that the existing fragmented land use pattern in Panyu has been somewhat locked in, and the redevelopment of rural industrial land has been difficult due to historical institutional uncertainty and path dependency. The uncertainty caused by volatile redevelopment policies, absence of trust between local government and villagers, long-time reliance of villages on land leasing income, and high transaction costs to achieve consensus among villages serve as key barriers to redevelopment. These problems have led to a prolonged redevelopment process and low participation of villages. The results suggest that further institutional change and more collaboration among various parties are necessary to overcome the current barriers of spatial lock-in to push forward the redevelopment of collective industrial land.",Wang Boyi,"Li, Tian","Yao, Zhihao",,,,,,,,,,,50,LAND USE POLICY,Institutional uncertainty,Fragmented urbanization,Spatial lock-in,Path-dependence,Collective industrial land,Urban and rural development,China,PROPERTY-RIGHTS,CONSTRUCTION LAND,HISTORY,SPRAWL,DYNAMICS,VILLAGES,PEOPLE,SHUNDE,MARKET,DELTA,,,,,,MAR 2018,"Institutional uncertainty, fragmented urbanization and spatial lock-in of the pen-urban area of China: A case of industrial land redevelopment in Panyu"

The residents of three neighbourhoods in the city of Barcelona-Trinitat Nova, Plus Ultra and Vallcarca- have endured and fought against the threat of radical urban renewals planned by the municipal authorities for decades, and their efforts have only recently been rewarded with the acceptance of their demands by local administrations. In this period, residents organized themselves to defend their vision of the place against official plans, a vision which was a collective construction of personal memories and historical evidences. in the PROHABIT research project, we have undertaken an interdisciplinary study, involving architects-planners and social and environmental psychologists, to understand the process of construction of a sense of community and place identity in three neighbourhoods. The study has highlighted the need to overcome the divisions between social sciences and design disciplines, between the real world of experience and the abstract world of design thinking. In this regard, the work conducted in this project offers some insights into the need to create a holistic understanding of today's urban environment, and how architects and planners need to develop skills and methods to enable them to form part of the open and participatory planning systems which our contemporary urban environments demand.","Madrazo, Leandro",,,,,,,,,,,,,4,OPEN HOUSE INTERNATIONAL,Lived Space,Neighbourhood Planning,Community Identity,PLACE,CITY,SELF,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 2019,THE SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION OF A NEIGHBOURHOOD IDENTITY

Row_934,"This paper explores the spatial and residential impact of social-mix and urban renewal policies in large French social housing estates. Tenure diversification is one of the drivers of a privatization process that is leading to an increase in private housing, especially home ownership developments. The wholesale urban restructuring of the modernist conception of high-rise buildings and open public spaces of the 1960s provides another vector. Analyzing the implementation of these two national strategies at large housing estate micro level-partly at La Duchere housing complex in Lyon-sheds light on how the design and location of new housing developments results in fragmentation of ""residences"" and space. To a certain extent, these social-mix policies exacerbate internal socio-residential differentiation by simply ""displacing the stigma"". What is new is rescaling at the level of small ""residences"" and gating of housing more than the segmentation process itself, which already existed in large housing estates. At the micro-level of large housing estates, this challenges the standardization of urban and social practices through design, the ""residualization"" of social housing and public space as well as the public management of fragmented space. In a broader context, these changes show how the recent shift in the French social housing model has been embodied in spatial reconfiguration.","Lelevrier, Christine",,,,,,,,,,,,,10,JOURNAL OF HOUSING AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT,Large housing estates,France,Urban renewal,Privatization,Fragmentation,Rescaling,SOCIAL MIX POLICIES,GENTRIFICATION,STIGMATIZATION,CHALLENGES,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 2023,Privatization of large housing estates in France: towards spatial and residential fragmentation
Row_935,"Ruins and derelict spaces are ubiquitous presences in contemporary cities. Probably because they are seen as undesirable and anomalous elements, scarce attention has been paid to them in urban studies. A theory of modern urban ruin is attempted in this paper. Using the Lisboan metropolitan area (Portugal) as case study, it is argued that dereliction and ruinification are part of the mutability of urban forms imposed by progress. The acceleration of time in modernity, by making the obsolescence of objects easier and faster, intensifies those processes. Dereliction and ruinification tend to occur more suddenly and randomly, breaking into the urban space in a chaotic and fractal geography, which reaches both central and peripheral areas. Finally, it is demonstrated that urban regeneration policies are favoring reinvestment in central areas, albeit selectively, and that a trend of ruins shifting to periphery is under way.","Brito-Henriques, Eduardo",,,,,,,,,,,,,0,EURE-REVISTA LATINOAMERICANA DE ESTUDIOS URBANO REGIONALES,urban theory,urban renewal,metropolitan areas,URBAN,GROWTH,TRENDS,POLICY,CITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2017,Ruin and regeneration of the space built in the metropole of XXI century: the case of Lisbon

Whilst the sale price of new apartments rises, a particular type of blockbusting limits the choices of the low-income residents to selling at a good price or staying put. The ratio between the different ground rent levels captured either by developers and original owner-residents confirms the extensive power deployed by the large-scale real estate firms at the moment of gentrifying central areas and the extent to which they generate residential displacement.
