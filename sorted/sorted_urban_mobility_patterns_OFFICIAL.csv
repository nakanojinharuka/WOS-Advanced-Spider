In this study, by visualizing bike-sharing mobility patterns in New York City, we reveal significant disparities in cycling usage between males and females. During weekdays, the findings highlight a pattern of male dominance in most areas, particularly in business districts. In some recreational and residential areas, routes with higher proportions of female cyclists are observed. Additionally, weekends experience a surge in the proportion of female cyclists, predominantly in leisure-oriented locations. These findings highlighted the need for urban planning to account for gender differences across space and time to meet diverse mobility needs.","Chen, Guiyu","Li, Chaosu",,,,,,,,,,,,,0,ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE,Gender disparity,urban mobility,spatial-temporal pattern,cycling behavior,bike-sharing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2024,Gender differences in spatio-temporal dynamics: Visualizing bike-sharing mobility patterns in New York City

This study assesses the spatial and temporal mobility patterns in response to flood events in Lagos State, Nigeria, a region prone to severe flooding due to its low-lying topography and rapid urbanization. By integrating human mobility and geospatial data, the study analyzes the correlation between flooding and POI visits using the Maximum Information Coefficient (MIC) and Difference-in-Differences (DiD) models. Results indicate significant variations across POI categories, with increased visits to Healthcare & Medical services reflecting emergency needs, while Transportation and Outdoor Recreation experience declines, highlighting the negative impact on general mobility and economic activities.

Row_4,"In this article, we explore intercity mobility in urban agglomerations by surveying people traveling across cities based on private car trajectory data. Specifically, we first adopt the statistical analysis method to mine the intercity mobility in terms of various metrics of travel trips, so as to gain a preliminary understanding of intercity mobility in urban agglomeration. Then, we utilize the tensor decomposition method to conduct in-depth study on the intercity mobility pattern from the perspectives of complexity and multidimensionality. We construct a 4-D tensor based on private car trajectory and point-of-interest (POI) datasets and define the functional similarity and geographic adjacency between regions. Finally, we design an alternating proximal gradient (APG)-based method to resolve the core tensor and factor matrix, leading to the fine-grained discovery of intercity mobility patterns on administrative divisions in the urban agglomeration. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the analysis of intercity mobility, using a real-world dataset containing one-year private car trajectories from five cities in the selected urban agglomeration. The experiments show that the proposed method successfully captures 20 intercity mobility patterns, in which the factor matrices retrieve the patterns from different dimensions with core tensors characterizing correlations between patterns in factor matrices. Besides, the extracted intercity mobility patterns not only cover administrative areas with frequent intercity interactions, but also contain areas with less intercity interactions. It validates that the intercity mobility is consistent with the regional functions in urban agglomeration.","Xiao, Zhu","Wu, Linshan","Jiang, Hongbo","Qin, Zheng","Gao, Chengxi","Li, You","Chen, Hongyang","Liu, Jiangchuan",,,,,,,3,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS,Intercity mobility,private car,trajectory data,urban agglomeration,PATTERNS,FACTORIZATION,GROWTH,MODEL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,APR 2024,Exploring Intercity Mobility in Urban Agglomeration: Evidence from Private Car Trajectory Data

Furthermore, this study aimed to describe daily urban rhythms in terms of human mobility. For these purposes, we constructed a GIS microscope by handling our geo-tagged big data based on the person-trip data. Through a multi-view study, we affirmed that the spatiotemporal mobility patterns had a certain consistency at different scales. Results suggested that the human mobility patterns expressed a typical inter-regional functional complementarity and a certain daily rhythm under the layout of TMA?s quadruple concentric ring structure.

Understanding travel movement patterns is crucial in developing sustainable planning for urban tourism. Built on network science, this article discusses 12 key topologies of travel patterns/flow occurring in a city network by applying network motif analytics. The 12 significant types of travel mobility can account for approximately 50% of the total movement patterns. In addition, this study presents variations in travel movement patterns depending on not only different lengths of stay in topological structures of travel mobility, but also relative proportions of each type.

Row_7,"Extracting hidden information from human mobility patterns is one of the long-standing challenges of urban studies. In addition, exploring the relationship between urban functional structure and traffic spatial interaction pattern has long been of interest. Recently, vehicle GPS trajectory data emerged as a popular data source for revealing human mobility patterns and urban functions. However, few studies have fully leveraged traffic interaction information that is hidden in human mobility patterns to identify urban functions at the road segment level. To address this issue, a geo-semantic analysis framework was introduced in this study to model the relationship between traffic interaction and urban functions at the road segment level. First, a Road-Trajectory corpus was built and trained to obtain the semantic embedding representation of road segments. Then, considering topological connections between road segments, we used a graph convolutional neural network model to process the contextual and topological information to classify social functions along streets. A case study in Beijing, China, using a large volume of real-world taxi trajectories data, was conducted. The results show that our proposed methods, with relative less loss and high accuracy, outperform other comparative methods for classifying urban functions at the road segment level.

Moving flocks, defined as groups of people traveling along over a pre-defined time duration, can reveal collective moving patterns at aggregated spatio-temporal scales, thereby facilitating the discovery of urban mobility structure and travel demand patterns. In this study, we extend classical trajectory-oriented flock mining algorithms to discover moving flocks of transit passengers, accounting for the constraints of multi-modal transit networks. We develop a map-centered visual analytics approach by integrating the flock mining algorithm with interactive visualization designs of discovered flocks. Novel interactive visualizations are designed and implemented to support the exploration and analyses of discovered moving flocks at different spatial and temporal scales.

This study fills this gap by providing a three-step analysis framework. First, aggregated trajectory data were transformed into a directed weighted network.

Row_12,"This paper uses a generalizable clustering approach to investigate the effects of socio-demographic features on aggregate urban mobility patterns, including activity distribution and travel modal split. We use K-means via principal component analysis to identify eight representative traveler clusters from the 2017 U.S. National Household Travel Survey. Based on the cluster centroids and the cluster percentages within a neighborhood, we can estimate a Temporal Mobility Choice Matrix ( TM ) that describes the neighborhood-level aggregate mobility choice pattern. The estimation accuracy is assessed in a case study in LA City. It is found that the neighborhood-level temporal mobility patterns are well-replicated, with an average R-2 of 65.47%, 53.15%, and 72.04% among all analyzed neighborhoods in the city. However, we find a moderate to low accuracy in estimating the spatial differences in the mobility patterns across neighborhoods. This could be because factors other than socio-demographics, such as physical and built environment factors like terrain, street quality, or amenity densities, are contributing to the spatial differences but have not been considered in this study. Overall, we show that socio-demographic features alone can approximate the average temporal mobility choice patterns of a given population. Our method and result can serve as the baseline and benchmark for future mobility studies that take the socio-demographics of the traveler population into consideration in modeling.","Yang, Yang","Samaranayake, Samitha","Dogan, Timur",,,,,,,,,,,,2,ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE,Urban mobility,socio-demographics,clustering,activity pattern,travel mode,BEHAVIOR,EXPLORE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2023,A clustering-based approach to quantifying socio-demographic impacts on urban mobility patterns

However, human mobility has usually been defined narrowly in prior research that limits the understanding of its values for urban applications. The aim of this study is to reveal the complexity and multiplicity of human mobility concept for various urban application scenarios, and present a comprehensive review of mobility-driven urban studies through four re-conceptualized urban mobility perspectives. Using a systematic review approach, existing mobility-driven urban studies are classified based on whether they interpret urban mobility as spatial movements, a social phenomenon, an economic indicator or a policy tool. Then, the core values of knowledge about urban mobility for addressing contemporary urban challenges are analyzed, and the current trends and future directions of mobility-driven urban studies are also discussed. Moving forward, the application of urban mobility knowledge can be further advanced by the evolution of mobility concepts, the improvement of mobility data quality and the innovation of mobility analytical methods.

Row_14,"Urban livability and sustainability require a deeper understanding of the impact of urban spatial structure on human mobility. Here two mobility networks generated from two taxi data from two cities (Chengdu and New York City) are used to explore human intra-urban mobility. Through the network analysis, we found that many measures of two mobility networks present a two-segment feature. Combined with the map and population distribution, we demonstrate that the two segments correspond to the central and non-central regions of the city, respectively, which means hierarchical mobility related to urban-rural structure exists in both cities, although they have different levels of urbanization. We comprehensively analyze the impact of urban-rural spatial structure on the nature of mobility networks. The central and non-central regions differ significantly in the heterogeneity of human mobility and present different ranges and directions of trips, like the large degree nodes, showing a flared entry and exit pattern. We improved a gravity model by introducing flows to and from the node instead of population to predict the traffic between different nodes, and the prediction results also vary significantly between the two regions. These findings are valuable for understanding the relationship between urbanrural spatial structure and human mobility.","Nie, Wei-Peng","Cai, Shi-Min","Zhao, Zhi-Dan","Gao, Fu-Juan","Li, Ze-Tao","Zhou, Tao",,,,,,,,,4,CITIES,Network analysis,Urban -rural spatial structure,Hierarchical mobility,Gravity model,PATTERNS,PREDICTION,SPREAD,CHINA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2023,Examining the impact of urban-rural spatial structure on mobility networks: A case study of taxis
Row_15,"Due to rapid urbanization and globalization, urban functions are increasingly segregated in cities comprising centers of population aggregation and economic activity. Urban development yields intertwining and interdependent functional areas for residence, commerce, and education, which leads to complex but regular population mobility patterns. Population mobility spaces can effectively represent the actual service scopes of urban functions. Therefore, in this study, we propose a function-associated population mobility network (FPMN) to dynamically delineate the service capacities of urban functions, and to quantify the driving effects of urban functions on population mobility under spatial interaction conditions. By integrating the cumulative opportunities of geographic nodes with the potential opportunities reflected by population mobility, k-step function accessibility with population mobility (k-step PFA) is defined in FPMN to characterize the accessibility relationships between geographic nodes and function nodes. Based on k-step PFA, considering the complementarity and intervention opportunities, the function-driven index (FDI) is proposed to quantify the driving effects of urban functions on population mobility. Our experimental results indicated that FPMN could effectively represent the actual service scopes and capabilities of urban functions. Compared with general location-based accessibility indicators, k-step PFA has a higher numerical distribution and less spatial disparity, and it aligns more closely with the actual service scopes of urban functions. In addition, compared with intervening opportunities models, FDI delineates the functional driving effects of population mobility with greater precision, as well as revealing the travel propensity traits of a population relative to various urban functions through propensity parameters.","Liu, Xinrui","Li, Rui","Cai, Jing","Li, Bosen","Li, Yanhao",,,,,,,,,,0,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION,Urban function,Population mobility network,Accessibility,Transferability,Complementarity,Intervention opportunities,PATTERNS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,Quantifying urban function accessibility and its effect on population mobility based on function-associated population mobility network
Row_16,"Latin America is a highly urbanized region characterized by remarkable inequality levels, also reflected in an uneven distribution of opportunities, making socio-economic segregation quite visible. Since the individual possibility to travel and therefore access to urban opportunities strongly depends on socio-economic status and the distances to overcome, highly unequal patterns of mobility and accessibility emerge. The continuous expansion of Latin American cities originates specific mobility-related inequalities visible in periurban areas, which tend to lack some key urban opportunities and public transport services usually available in cities. Due to established and new patterns of territorial segregation, these areas may generate new forms of marginality in relation to mobility, posing challenges for public action and territorial governance. Our paper considers if and how periurban areas experience different forms of mobility-related inequalities in three Latin American metropolises in Brazil, Chile, and Colombia (Sao Paulo, Santiago, and Bogota, respectively). We do so by examining the differences among urban core and periurban zones based on four elements: socio-demographic features, access to the public transport system, spatial continuity, and functional dependence. Our analysis shows that the three metropolitan regions have different structures: while Bogota and Santiago appear to be more dependent on the urban core, Sao Paulo shows more autonomous and self-sufficient periurban zones. The analysis also high-lights different forms of peripherality, defined by differentiated mobility patterns and modal choices that suggest that city-specific lines for public action might be needed.","Tiznado-Aitken, Ignacio","Vecchio, Giovanni","Guzman, Luis A.","Arellana, Julian","Humberto, Mateus","Vasconcellos, Eduardo","Munoz, Juan Carlos",,,,,,,,15,HABITAT INTERNATIONAL,Periurbanization,Urban mobility,Accessibility,Urban inequality,Latin America,TRANSPORT ACCESSIBILITY,METROPOLITAN-AREA,SOCIAL EXCLUSION,CAR DEPENDENCE,SAO-PAULO,LAND-USE,GROWTH,SANTIAGO,POVERTY,POOR,,,,,,,MAR 2023,"Unequal periurban mobility: Travel patterns, modal choices and urban core dependence in Latin America"

Row_19,"A large number of Censuses and surveys around the globe only measure 'migrations' crossing particular politico-administrative boundaries, most commonly 'major' areas like states. These moves, in turn, are often assumed to be representative of all long-distance or, in some settings, urban-urban moves. While important because such boundaries signal relevant policy environments, little research has tested these assumptions and, more broadly, the implications of examining mobility using an inter/intrastate classification schema versus other substantively-relevant approaches. Because these examinations have been particularly absent in developing nations, we compare the dynamics and correlates of mobility across inter/intrastate, distance- and rural/urban-based classification schemata in Mexico, a nation with heterogeneous mobility similar to other large middle-income countries and overall good data availability. We use 2000, 2010 and 2020 Census long-form data to examine the changing dynamics of mobility patterns and correlates across the classification schemata. While we find that interstate mobility does cover a large majority of long-distance and many urban-urban moves, we find that the correlates of interstate movement vary considerably from urban-urban movement in particular. We also find that excluding intrametropolitan from other types of moves may be a sensible strategy to better characterize some processes, an issue of increasing relevance in a more urban world and where city-regions span across major administrative areas. Given these findings, for a better understanding socioeconomic patterns and trends, we recommend that studies of internal migration avoid intra/interstate schema, consider separating intrametropolitan moves, and combine distance-based and rural-urban-metropolitan approaches.","Riosmena, Fernando","Balk, Deborah",,,,,,,,,,,,,2,POPULATION SPACE AND PLACE,distance,internal migration,metropolitan,Mexico,residential mobility,rural,spatial interaction models,spatial mobility,urban,LIFE-COURSE,MIGRATION,DISTANCE,URBAN,AFRICA,,,,,,,,MAR 2024,The importance of classification schema choice in internal mobility: An examination in contemporary Mexico
Row_20,"Rapid urbanization in China has prompted plenty of urban facilities to be constructed with the expectation of harmonizing with the rapid growth of urban population. However, regarding the spatial interactions produced by cross-area human mobility, the diversity and variability of residents' trip requirements inevitably cause the deviations of the real interaction patterns from the optimal status determined by the current allocation of urban facilities. To maximize the utility of urban facility allocation, we designed a bipartite network-based approach to explore anomalous spatial interaction patterns within cities. First, considering the potential area attractiveness, a weighted origin-destination bipartite network was constructed to structure the spatial interactions between traffic analysis zones. Then, a branch and bound (BnB) based augmenting path algorithm was proposed to optimize the distribution of spatial interactions, which can maximize the urban population carrying capabilities. Finally, anomalous interaction patterns causing both overload and underload were detected through comparisons between the actual and optimal spatial interaction distribution. The experimental results show that the two types of anomalous interaction patterns have significantly different spatial distribution characteristics. Through further analyzing the relationships between the two types of anomalous interaction patterns and urban evolution process, this study can also provide targeted decision supports for the accommodating of urban facility allocations to the distributions of resident trips in space.","Liu, Baoju","Deng, Min","Yang, Jingyi","Shi, Yan","Huang, Jincai","Li, Chengming","Qiu, Bingwen",,,,,,,,16,COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS,Anomaly interaction pattern,Bipartite network,Urban population carrying capacity,Human mobility,FLOW,MOBILITY,CITIES,MEDIA,MODEL,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 2021,Detecting anomalous spatial interaction patterns by maximizing urban population carrying capacity
Row_21,"Urban spatial structure and mobility patterns co-evolve. A fundamental process that underpins the emergent structure of cities and commuting patterns is location choice with respect to housing and employment. Consequently, location choice models constitute important sub-components of land use-and-transport-interaction (LUTI) and urban growth models. This paper documents the development and application of the Metropolitan Location and Mobility Patterns Simulator (METLOMP-SIM). METLOMP-SIM is a geospatial agent-based model that simulates how urban structure and travel patterns co-emerge, as a function of the location decisions of heterogeneous households and individuals within a spatially-explicit urban context. After specifying a generic conceptual model that identifies the model's structure, entities and agents' decision-making framework, METLOMP-SIM is implemented using the Kumasi Metropolis in Ghana, Sub-Saharan Africa as case study. Overall, the implemented model demonstrates that the encoded micro-scale behaviour of households and individuals are able to mimic some macro-scale residential and job location patterns, and patterns of home-work trip flows that closely match patterns in the case study metropolis.

Row_22,"Origin-Destination (OD) flow, as an abstract representation of the object's movement or interaction, has been used to reveal the movement patterns of human activities and the coupling process of the human-land system.

However, urban flow exhibits universal heterogeneity, which is mainly manifested in irregular shapes, uneven distribution, and obvious scale differences. The existing methods are constrained by specific spatial scales and sensitive parameter settings, making it difficult to reveal heterogeneous urban mobility patterns within travel OD data. In this paper, we propose an OD flow analysis method that integrates spatial statistics and density clustering. This method can determine parameter values from datasets without manual intervention and adaptively identify multi-scale mixed OD flow clusters. In the simulation experiment, the proposed method accurately detects all preset OD clusters with less noise. It outperforms the baseline methods in terms of Silhouette Coefficient, V-measure, and Fowlkes Mallows index.

Using the nationwide location-based services datasets in China, we bridge current research gaps by investigating temporal dynamics on mobility network centrality and capturing time-variation patterns of mobility flows across non-holiday period and multiple holidays. Our findings demonstrate varying characteristics in degree, betweenness, and clustering centrality across different periods, alongside an increasing trend of mobility flows on holidays. Moreover, typical time-variation patterns reveal the weekly periodic dynamics of net mobility flows during non-holiday periods, with distinguished peaks emerging on Mondays and Saturdays. Holidays promote significant spatiotemporal fluctuations in net mobility flows, classifying cities into inbound, outbound, and balanced categories based on population mobility directions. Through the determining factor analysis incorporating comprehensive urban attributes and spatial correlations, this study establishes the influencing relationships of urban attributes and period characteristics on intercity mobility flows.

Previous studies investigated the mechanism of human mobility by constructing spatial mobility motifs based on mobile phone datasets, but ignored their temporal characteristics. To compensate for this, this study extracted temporal stay patterns based on spatial mobility motifs. Using mobile phone location data from Shenzhen, China, we identified stop location sequences for users and constructed home-based mobility motifs according to predefined rules, and observed that approximately 97% of users can be characterized by the 10 identified home-based mobility motifs.

Not only is the magnitude of the mobility carbon footprint large, but its dynamics make reducing it very challenging. Our paper addresses the impact of crises on the transformation of mobility patterns, including short-distance mobility and holiday tourism. A first study was conducted after the 2008-2010 crisis using focus-group participatory systems mapping. This found that when people are forced to change their habits for financial reasons, they adapt holiday travel first. Nonetheless, participants were just as satisfied with domestic destinations, provided they could spend time with loved ones. The second study focused on the COVID-19 crisis. Participants missed foreign travel, so some rebound seems inevitable. However, the crisis has been an incubator of changes in urban mobility that could reduce carbon footprints in the longer term and offset the prospective increase in tourism.

In this study, we propose a method to characterize the urban function of U.S. metropolitan areas by analyzing trip patterns extracted from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey. To characterize urban form, we employ measures that capture road network topology. We cluster cities based on both form and function and subsequently compare these clusters. Our analysis of 52 U.S. metropolitan areas identifies 7 distinct clusters of cities that exhibit similar travel behavior, suggesting that diverse mobility patterns can be effectively grouped into a few universal classes.

However, planning for active mobility is a complex endeavour due to numerous local, place-based factors that influence active mobility decisions. Recent advancements in urban data research have demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning methods in evaluating active mobility potential for urban environments. At present, the incorporation of semantic information from deep learning models and street view imagery into spatio-temporal contexts remains a challenge. In particular, knowledge extraction from deep learning models remains an open question for urban planning and decision-making. Towards this issue, we propose a functional deep learning and network science workflow that employs open data from OpenStreetMap and Mapillary to assess factors affecting active mobility decisions and route planning.

Using 3-year big data, this paper provides a comprehensive framework to decode China's intercity mobility using machine learning-based city classification techniques and econometric analysis. Cities are classified into four types according to monthly fluctuations and year-round mobility trends: central cities, tourist and hub cities, labour export cities, and less-mobility cities. Central cities are located in major urban agglomerations, while tourist and hub cities are sparsely distributed nationwide. There is also a north-south divide pattern where labour export cities cover areas of central and southern regions, and lessmobility cities are mainly located in northern and northeastern regions. The econometric analysis results reveal the predominant role of the long-term floating population in all mobility indexes and the different impacts of short-term leisure and business trips and transportation facilities. Furthermore, moderating effects of city types and city change paths are detected.

Row_40,"In scientific literature there is a wide agreement on the negative consequences of urban sprawl for some decades. Quantifying these negative consequences of urban sprawl can be extremely helpful for local and regional decision making. Numerous methods have been developed to quantify urban sprawl and its consequences and land use models have been used to study possible effects in the future. The results of these studies, however, do not always find their way to policy makers because they are often too abstract for them. In order to bridge this science-policy gap, this study proposes a participatory approach to make existing methods and models more fit for policy purposes. The study focuses on three policy questions: (1) how to quantify urban sprawl in a way that is more intuitive for policy makers to use in their communication, (2) how to quantify the costs of infrastructure and mobility related to urban sprawl and (3) how will these costs evolve towards the future? Three urban growth scenarios were simulated using a land use model and the outputs of the model were translated to an urban sprawl typology and corresponding costs for infrastructure and mobility. This allows to evaluate potential monetary savings of alternative urban development patterns. The results show that costs for infrastructure and mobility are much higher for patterns dominated by dispersed buildings and ribbon development than in more dense types of urban development in Flanders. The scenarios show that gradually bringing back urban growth could lead to annual savings of 246-383 million euros in terms of reduced investments and maintenance costs for infrastructure and annual savings of 1156-1965 million euros in terms of costs for mobility. Quantifying the potential savings of alternative scenarios of urban growth offers planners and policy makers insight into practical consequences of strategic decisions for development plans that are critical to implement sustainable urban development.","Vermeiren, Karolien","Crols, Tomas","Uljee, Inge","De Nocker, Leo","Beckx, Carolien","Pisman, Ann","Broekx, Steven","Poelmans, Lien",,,,,,,23,LAND USE POLICY,Urban sprawl,Economic impact,Spatial policy,Participatory modelling,Sustainable urban development,Land use modelling,LAND-USE CHANGE,PATTERNS,RUNOFF,DESIGN,IMPACT,TRAVEL,,,,,,,,,,FEB 2022,"Modelling urban sprawl and assessing its costs in the planning process: A case study in Flanders, Belgium"

Eighty relevant papers published between 2015-2020 are included. This review evaluates the quality of each model through the newly developed AAODD (Autonomous vehicle Agent-based Overview, Design concepts and Details) protocol in four perspectives: model transparency, research questions, network + agent behaviour and model execution. Then, similarities and particularities of the papers are summarised based on whether AVs are used for passenger mobility or for freight logistics.The reviewed mobility papers exhibit the ABMs' applicability and flexibility for studying different AV operational patterns. We summarise the respective modelling specifications in research questions, data collections, model platforms, model executions, and scenario variations. Overall, by combining AVs with different technical possibilities and operational strategies, the simulation results illustrate that AVs would bring vast benefits to urban mobility networks.Unlike AVs' usage in passenger mobility, it is still unclear how AVs will serve future urban logistics demands. Many operational patterns, including unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous robots, autonomous trucks, and autonomous cargo-hatching vehicles coexist in the research community. The number of relevant papers remains low due to the early stage of AV technology deployment. However, ABMs also prove their applicability for analysing the macro and mesoscopic impacts of freight AV transportation on urban network. The reviewed papers suggest that implementing AVs for urban logistics is more efficient and environmentally friendly than conventional delivery vehicles.Overall, ABMs are a powerful tool for simulating future urban scenarios with AVs. By calculating the average score of reviewed papers obtained via AAODD annually, we find that studies simulating AV systems in ABMs are getting more complex by combing diverse technological possibilities, supporting the simulation of more realistic future scenarios. The outcomes of reviewed ABM research reveals that AVs are a promising solution for solving current urban transport problems. Lastly, as nearly all current reviewed studies focus on AVs' usages in either mobility or logistics, research on an integrated simulation that combines AVs for both purposes has been scarcely addressed.

Two-scale analysis of spatial colocation patterns reveals residential segregation by both residential location and housing type, suggesting the effectiveness of the mobility data in profiling socioeconomic groups. The temporal disparity in undertaking activities was unveiled by identifying temporal coexistence patterns. Moreover, the groups presented significant inequality in accessibility owing to the use of different travel modes, leading to a notable disparity in activity diversity.

However, few studies have attempted to explore the mobility of these social groups, especially for developing countries where census data with travel information are not readily available. This study explores whether people in the same social area have similar work mobility and whether location matters from an aggregated neighborhood perspective. A case study is conducted in Shenzhen, China with fine-grained census and mobile phone data. The neighborhood committee based census and cell tower based mobile phone data are integrated into 500 m grid for analysis. Results show that different social areas have significantly different work mobility, and the within-group heterogeneity is also prominent. Three location factors are examined and it is found that there exist variations in the influence of spatial factors on work mobility for different social areas. Findings of this study will supplement current knowledge about social areas, location and mobility in urban China at the mesoscale.

Row_51,"The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had a pernicious influence on the whole world, so that the international community implemented various travel policies to inhibit the viral spread. With the COVID-19 pandemic under control, the overly lenient measures allowed the new variant to take advantage. Also, it is difficult to determine the geographical scope of transport policy that has the least impact on work resumption. Therefore, it is necessary to find policies to promote work resumption while preventing and controlling the pandemic in a geographical perspective. In this paper, a framework based on mobile phone data is proposed for promoting work resumption during the pandemic. First, human mobility networks are constructed through the origin-destination flow extracted from mobile phone data. Second, the singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm is utilized to recognize the mobility patterns and explore the urban mobility dynamics of workresumption-related travel during the pandemic. Third, the nonoverlapping community detection algorithm is used to generate policy zoning for work-resumption-related travel. Finally, the policy zoning is validated by public health data based on the overlay analysis and spatial statistics method, and policy implications are proposed. A case study of Shanghai, China is applied to verify the proposed framework. The results show that the framework can capture the mobility patterns and implement the policy zoning based on mobile phone data to balance the economic activity and public health during the pandemic, and the proposed framework can be applied to other cities with future public health events.","He, Linghui","Li, Weifeng","Li, Jian","Sun, Jianping",,,,,,,,,,,1,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,COVID-19,Work resumption,Mobile phone data,Urban mobility dynamics,Singular value decomposition,Community detection,TRAVEL BEHAVIOR,PATTERNS,INDIVIDUALS,NETWORKS,OUTBREAK,DISEASE,,,,,,,,,,MAY 2024,Urban mobility analytics amid COVID-19 pandemic: A framework for promoting work resumption based on mobile phone data
Row_52,"Urban green space is conducive to the physical and mental health of residents. However, exposure to green space is often highly unequal. This research addresses a major gap in the green space literature: how daily mobility patterns lead to differential exposure to green space among residents and how this varies by gender. The study uses travel data (7,800 trips) from 662 residents in Beijing (Haidan District), in combination with high-resolution street-view data and machine learning, to measure exposure to green space. The results show that there are significant disparities with respect to exposure to green space during daily travel, with men having advantages in terms of this exposure. This is, in part, due to the fact that their travel patterns varied more widely. Women had more exposure to green space, in terms of overall travel time, but it was more constrained to selected routes. Reasons for these disparities are complex, with age, occupation, household type and travel mode (e.g., car, bus, by foot) all important factors that intertwine with gender. In addition to revealing gender disparities associated with exposure to green space, this study provides a novel mixed method to capture daily travel patterns that can be used for a broad array of inquiries related to mobility in the built environment.","Wu, Jiayu","Xu, Zike","Jin, Yunhan","Chai, Yanwei","Newell, Joshua","Ta, Na",,,,,,,,,21,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,Green space exposure,Daily mobility patterns,Disparities,Gender,Urban planning,TRAVEL MODE CHOICE,ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE,TIME-USE,ACTIVITY PATTERNS,URBAN PARKS,HEALTH,NEIGHBORHOOD,ACCESS,CONSTRAINTS,WOMEN,,,,,,,JUN 2022,Gender disparities in exposure to green space: An empirical study of suburban Beijing

Mobility patterns significantly impact building occupancy, which in turn affects energy consumption. However, existing methods often focus on individual buildings, whereas geographical influences on energy usage are not adequately examined. This study addresses this gap by using transportation origin-destination (OD) data to estimate building occupancy and energy. The proposed method assigns OD trips from census block groups to the building level, incorporating building, travel survey, and census data to derive building occupancy profiles. This method was applied to urban and rural areas with 4062 buildings in 70 census block groups. We found that the OD-informed occupancy profile exhibits smoother energy consumption patterns compared with that of Department of Energy reference occupancy profiles. Our analysis reveals distinct building energy consumption patterns among groups with long and short commutes, emphasizing the effect of commute times and work schedules on residential energy usage. This framework is useful for practitioners in transportation agencies and utility companies, enabling the estimation of building energy based on mobility patterns. Overall, this study shows the potential of integrating transportation and building energy data to inform cross-sector energy management strategies.","Pan, Meiyu Melrose","Li, Wan","Wang, Chieh Ross",,,,,,,,,,,,0,ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE,Travel behavior,Spatial data,Building simulation,Building occupancy,Origin-destination data,Cross-sector,CHARGING STATIONS,COMMUTERS,BEHAVIOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,From roads to roofs: How urban and rural mobility influence building energy consumption
Row_54,"Rapid urbanization has dramatically changed the urban spatial structures, causing a mismatch between residents' commuting activities and the optimal status of the current urban facility configuration. However, limited attention has been paid to detecting these mismatched commuting patterns and their associations with built environmental characteristics. To maximize the effectiveness of urban facility allocation and improve commuting efficiency, this paper developed a framework to identify anomalous commuting interaction patterns. A weighted bipartite network considering urban land attractiveness was first constructed to analyze the commuting flows between urban units. Then a modified Hungarian algorithm was proposed to obtain the optimal commuting interaction fluxes. By comparing real and optimal interaction fluxes, two types of commuting anomalies were detected. Finally, the machine learning model was used to explore the non-linear relationships between built environment and anomalous commuting patterns. Results show the spatial distribution of areas with significant anomalous interactions and the difference between overload- and underload- related anomalous commuting patterns. Potential urban sub-centers were identified to adjust the urban spatial layouts. Besides, the nonlinear and threshold effects of the built environment on the two anomalous commuting patterns were confirmed, which can provide references for urban spatial renewal and commuting flow allocation.","Tong, Zhaomin","Zhang, Ziyi","An, Rui","Liu, Yaolin","Chen, Huiting","Xu, Jiwei","Fu, Shihang",,,,,,,,0,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Anomalous commuting patterns,Bipartite network,Built environment,Machine learning model,Non-linear effects,BUILT ENVIRONMENT,BIG DATA,HUMAN MOBILITY,CHINA,MODEL,TRANSPORTATION,CHOICE,SPACE,SCALE,TIME,,,,,,,APR 2024,Detecting anomalous commuting patterns: Mismatch between urban land attractiveness and commuting activities
Row_55,"Understanding the travel flux between urban blocks is fundamental for traffic demand prediction, urban area planning and urban traffic management. However, the uncertainty of human mobility patterns and the complexity of urban transportation systems usually yield challenges in accurately estimating the travel flux within a city. Thus, we propose a novel travel flux estimation method that integrates traffic flow characteristics (traffic volume and travel time), spatio-temporal autocorrelation, and travel purpose correlation. First, the geographically weighted method was used to model and verify the spatio-temporal autocorrelation of origin-destination flows, whereas the purpose correlation of origin-destination flows was expressed through the function feature vectors of urban blocks. Then, a multi-objective bi-level programming model, according to the generalized least squares method, was constructed to estimate the travel flux between blocks. This was used to solve the problem of accurate estimation of travel flux by combining microscopic traffic flow characteristics with macroscopic spatio-temporal and purpose characteristics. Finally, an empirical analysis of the Hankou district, Wuhan City, demonstrated that in contrast to the existing method, the accuracy of the proposed method for predicting the human travel flux improved by approximately 20%. The estimated results were consistent with the spatial distribution pattern of human travel. Moreover, these results can provide targeted decision support for planning urban spaces, allocating urban resources, and guiding vehicular traffic.","Liu, Baoju","Tang, Zhongan","Deng, Min","Shi, Yan","He, Xiao","Huang, Bo",,,,,,,,,1,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Travel flux estimation,Spatio-temporal autocorrelation,Purpose correlation,Integer programming,SPATIAL INTERACTION PATTERNS,ORIGIN-DESTINATION MATRICES,TRAFFIC DEMAND,MOBILITY,IDENTIFICATION,PREDICTION,NETWORKS,FLOWS,LAW,,,,,,,,,APR 2024,Estimation of travel flux between urban blocks by combining spatio-temporal and purpose correlation

Recent research has shifted from static methods of assessing exposure to greenspaces, based on fixed locations, to dynamic approaches that account for individual mobility. These dynamic evaluations utilize advanced technologies like GPS tracking and remote sensing to provide more precise exposure estimates. However, little work has been conducted to compare dynamic and static exposure assessments and the effect of individual mobility on these evaluations. This study delves into how greenspaces around homes and workplaces, along with mobility patterns, affect dynamic greenspace exposure in Hong Kong. Data was collected from 787 participants in four communities in Hong Kong using GPS, portable sensors, and surveys. Using multiple statistical tests, our study revealed significant variations in participants' daily mobility patterns across socio-demographic and temporal factors. Further, using linear mixed-effects models, we identified complex and statistically significant interactions between participants' static greenspace exposure and their mobility patterns. Our findings suggest that individual mobility patterns significantly modify the relationship between static and dynamic greenspace exposure and play a critical role in explaining socio-demographic and temporal context differences in the relationship between static and dynamic greenspace exposure.","Zheng, Lingwei","Kwan, Mei-Po","Liu, Yang","Liu, Dong","Huang, Jianwei","Kan, Zihan",,,,,,,,,4,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,Urban greenspace,Static exposure,Dynamic exposure,Mobility,Linear mixed-effect regression,Hong Kong,PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY,HEALTH,VIEW,GENDER,TRAVEL,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 1 2024,How mobility pattern shapes the association between static green space and dynamic green space exposure

Accurate assessment of an individual's exposure to these natural settings is thus crucial in urban greenspace planning. However, the dynamic nature of human mobility, which determines the amount of greenspace exposure accessed over time and space, often leads to a divergence between the actual Mobility-Based Exposure (MBE) and the traditional Residence-Based Exposure (RBE). This discrepancy, encapsulated as the neighborhood effect averaging problem (NEAP), prompted us to examine the bias introduced by such discrepancy and its association with various human-based factors. This study delves into the complex interplay among the NEAP, individual mobility patterns, and demographic characteristics with fine-resolution estimations in Beijing, aiming to provide a nuanced understanding of the NEAP's influence. Uncovering heterogeneous patterns of disparity between RBE and MBE across distinct geographical realms and sociodemographic cohorts, and how such effects are mediated by populations with diverse mobility traits, the study illuminates the prevalence and complexity of the NEAP. Younger individuals, the employed population, those with larger activity spaces, high visitation diversity, and travel frequency, and residents living in areas with significant deviations from mean RBE levels experience a more pronounced NEAP impact. These insights contribute to a holistic grasp of the NEAP and underscore the imperative of inclusive greenspace urban planning that caters to the diverse mobility patterns and disparities among residents from different demographic groups, offering invaluable guidance for policy interventions to amplify greenspace exposure and address health disparities.","Wang, Jianying","Kwan, Mei-Po","Xiu, Gezhi","Peng, Xia","Liu, Yu",,,,,,,,,,9,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,Neighborhood effect averaging,Greenspace exposure,Human mobility,Equity,URBAN GREEN,AIR-POLLUTION,HEALTH,SPACE,ASSOCIATIONS,DEFINITION,VEGETATION,ACCESS,ERRORS,BUFFER,,,,,,,,MAR 2024,Investigating the neighborhood effect averaging problem (NEAP) in greenspace exposure: A study in Beijing

Moreover, the mobility pattern analysis exhibits differences between groups with respect to frequent locations, radius of gyration, and population spatial distribution.

However, the gender lens towards understanding the mobility patterns of women and young girls is largely missing from the urban planning process. Due to this exclusion, the majority of Indian cities are not gender friendly. To address this issue, this study tried to propose a 3 step framework for mitigating gender safety issues while a woman walks in a city. The 3 steps involve identifying the key elements of pedestrian mobility; quantitatively evaluating the qualitative parameters; and visual analysis for validating the major issues. This paper presents a pilot study conducted in the city of Kanpur, India. The research was initiated by conducting focus group discussions among 23 participants to map their typical movement patterns and identify 6 key elements of pedestrian mobility. Subsequently, the study conducted a net promoter score (NPS) survey among 423 participants to gauge the safety perception levels on each of the 6 key elements against 5 deduced qualitative parameters via literature review. NPS is a user satisfaction measurement tool which is based on the user perception used by companies and brands. Since urban safety is largely to do with perception, a NPS metric is employed. Further, the paper employed heatmap analysis and derived 3 critical areas based on gender safety perception to deep dive i.e. accessibility and lighting at sidewalks; lack of lighting at underpass; and absence of street furniture at bus stops. Visual analysis was undertaken to understand and validate the respective safety perceptions. The NPS score and visual analysis helped to generate actionable recommendations to enhance the safety perception of women in the city, especially pertaining to pedestrian mobility.","Yadav, Asmita","Kumari, Rashmi",,,,,,,,,,,,,1,CITIES,Pedestrian mobility,Gender safety,Inclusive planning and Net Promoter Score,(NPS),PUBLIC SPACES,WOMEN,WALKABILITY,CITIES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,APR 2024,Gender safety perspective in urban planning: The case of pedestrian mobility in Kanpur city

A better understanding of human mobility in rural areas could inform efforts to achieve rural revitalization. However, there have been limited evaluations of the characteristics of human mobility in rural areas. Based on human movements estimated from mobile phone data, we constructed an inter-town human mobility network and applied a complex network analysis method to study the spatial characteristics of the human mobility network in rural areas, with China's Greater Bay Area as a case study. We found that rural towns with high centrality were mostly located at the convergence of developed megacities. Rural towns with most connections were not necessarily the most central in the inter-town human mobility networks, leading to anomalous values of the centrality. We demonstrated that the anomaly of centrality values emerged due to the community structure of the network. We identified nine communities in the network and found that the geographical borders of communities partly matched the urban administrative borders. However, the results also showed that many rural towns on the fringes of a city were dissolved in their adjacent developed cities, independent of the urban administrative boundary effect. The formation of communities cannot be explained only by the impacts of urban administrative boundaries, but also by the growth of large cities and the geographic dispersal of economic activities. Finally, we identified seven roles of rural towns based on their pattern of intra-community and inter-community connections. These findings provide important insights into the pattern of interaction among rural towns.","Liu, Zhengying","Zhao, Pengjun","Liu, Qiyang","Cui, Yanzhe","Yang, Yuan","Liu, Juan","Li, Buhui","Li, Jingwei",,,,,,,3,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Spatial characteristics,Mobility network,Complex network,Rural areas,Greater Bay Area,WORLD CITY NETWORKS,EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS,CENTRALITY,FLOWS,BEHAVIOR,REGION,PHONE,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2023,Exploring the spatial characteristics of the human mobility network in rural settings of China's Greater Bay Area

Natural hazards can cause failures in a transportation system, which can affect mobility and other economic activities in a community. Diversity is recognized as an important factor of resilience in transportation infrastructure, but empirical work linking the two is limited. In this study, the impact of transportation diversity on mobility in New York City after Hurricane Sandy is explored. Transportation diversity, defined as the availability and distribution of modes in a community, is measured by employing a recently developed approach at the zip code level using transportation system GIS data. The geotagged Twitter data of one month before and after Hurricane Sandy in New York City are used to understand mobility patterns before and after this extreme event. The primary locations of individuals are found, and their mobility patterns are subsequently determined by measuring travel distance, the radius of gyration, and mobility entropy one week and one month before and after the hurricane. Individuals are grouped in quartiles based on the transportation diversity of their primary locations, which is determined by two different methods that overcome the lack of transportation system information in call detail records and social media data. The results indicate that the distance, radius, and entropy of all individuals significantly decreased after Sandy. The comparison of the significance of change in mobility metrics by diversity quartiles revealed that one-week distance and radius metrics in low transportation diversity quartiles were changed and statistically significant. Thus, individuals with primary locations in zip codes with higher transportation diversity generally had a higher maintained distance and radius one week after the hurricane. The comparison of diversity quartiles in the one-month analysis showed that the radius of low transportation diversity quartiles was impacted more than high transportation diversity quartiles and was statistically significant. Further, the comparison of results of one week and one month after the hurricane indicated that distance, radius of gyration, and entropy improved after a month as the transportation system was recovering. The findings establish an empirical link between transportation diversity and intraurban mobility in the wake of natural disasters such as Hurricane Sandy and confirm that transportation diversity influences individual postdisaster mobility. In addition, the results contribute to the mobility resilience literature by deepening our understanding of the underlying drivers of changes in human mobility following extreme events.

It can allow more flexible allocation of public resources such as public transportation schedule adjustment and arrangement of police force. After 2020, because of the epidemic of COVID-19 virus, the public mobility pattern is deeply affected by the situation of epidemic as the physical close contact is the dominant way of infection. In this study, we propose a confirmed case-driven time-series prediction of crowd in urban hot spot named MobCovid. The model is a deviation of Informer, a popular time-serial prediction model proposed in 2021. The model takes both the number of nighttime staying people in downtown and confirmed cases of COVID-19 as input and predicts both the targets. In the current period of COVID, many areas and countries have relaxed the lockdown measures on public mobility. The outdoor travel of public is based on individual decision. Report of large amount of confirmed cases would restrict the public visitation of crowded downtown. But, still, government would publish some policies to try to intervene in the public mobility and control the spread of virus. For example, in Japan, there are no compulsory measures to force people to stay at home, but measures to persuade people to stay away from downtown area. Therefore, we also merge the encoding of policies on measures of mobility restriction made by government in the model to improve the precision. We use historical data of nighttime staying people in crowded downtown and confirmed cases of Tokyo and Osaka area as study case. Multiple times of comparison with other baselines including the original Informer model prove the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Such infrastructures are large enough to have systemic qualities (e.g., fixed nodes, instrumented networks, and operational requirements) and complex institutional arrangements but small enough in cost and impact that they do not systemically transform urbanization patterns. In this article, we analyze one such mesoscale infrastructure system, bicycle sharing, across three urban regions in the United States: Austin, Texas, Philadelphia, and the San Francisco Bay Area. We argue that bicycle sharing systems in the United States have three key features: (1) widespread expectations of fiscal self-sufficiency restrict their geographical reach to urban centers; (2) they largely follow existing patterns of racialized uneven development, leading to major service gaps; and (3) their implementation involves contingent institutional configurations that create modest openings for steering them in more equitable directions. At the same time, newer venture capital-funded ""dockless"" competitors have exploited the coverage gaps of station-based bike sharing without departing from their basic market-driven logic. Mesoscale infrastructural experimentation is increasingly central to efforts to increase mobility options in the United States but, when implemented within existing urban political economies, tends to produce scales of infrastructure that are at odds with more substantive forms of mobility justice.","Stehlin, John G.","Payne, Will B.",,,,,,,,,,,,,9,ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS,bicycling,infrastructure,mobility,scale,uneven development,IMPACTS,CITY,GOVERNANCE,POLITICS,CITIES,,,,,,,,,,,,APR 28 2022,"Mesoscale Infrastructures and Uneven Development: Bicycle Sharing Systems in the United States as ""Already Splintered"" Urbanism"

This paper utilizes the concept of 'mobility of care' to quantitatively assess care-related trips in the Barcelona Metropolitan Region (BMR) using an official household travel survey. We analyse the factors linked to care-related trips at the individual, household, and territorial levels and examine their correlation with transportation modes. Our results reveal that care-related trips form a significant portion of everyday mobility in a Mediterranean metropolis such as Barcelona. Notably, mobility of care is more relevant among women, increases with age and the presence of dependents in the household, particularly minors. Active modes of transportation, primarily in densely populated urban areas, dominate care-related mobility in Barcelona. Finally, our findings suggests that while the concept of mobility of care helps to conceptualizing a key part of our daily reality and helps identifying possible social inequalities, it is still necessary to account and understand specific care-related purposes.

The first step is to estimate the initial movement pattern in each spatiotemporal grid, and then to estimate the accumulated movement pattern within a time period around a geographical grid. This method can be applied adaptively to multi-scale spatiotemporal grid data. Using geospatial visualization methods, estimated motion characteristics such as velocity and flow direction can be made intuitive and integrated with other multiscale geospatial data. Furthermore, the correlation between the population mobility pattern and demographic characteristics, such as gender and age groups, can be analyzed with intuitive visualization.

By taking this trajectory approach, we aim to advance the understanding of divergent rural-to-urban migration patterns in China and their determinants and consequences. We use data from the Survey of Internal Migration and Health in China (IMHC) and focus on individuals' migration experience between age 14 and 40. First, we apply sequence analysis to characterise the main rural-to-urban migration patterns by different timing, duration, frequency, and direction and identify seven common patterns. We next examine the determinants of these patterns.

Furthermore, we examine via a counterfactual framework how the seven migration patterns shape migrants' occupational attainment while taking account of self-selection into different migration trajectories.

The geographical consequences lie in spatial time series dimensions, but the chaotic characteristics hinder intuitive understanding. Aiming to discover the variance of urban mobility in the pandemic context, this article presents a hybrid clustering technique called whole time sequence mixture (WTSM). The combination of whole time and subsequence techniques ensures robustness to data volume, dimensionality, sampling, distortion tasks, and a prior constraint. For yellow taxi trips in New York City, the case study spanned the pre-, mid-, and postpandemic periods and compared the performance of the established methods (symbolic aggregate approximation and dynamic time warping) and WTSM techniques. Findings revealed COVID-19 trends and social restriction-induced mobility variations and determined that vaccine supply did not lead to immediate mobility restoration. Meanwhile, concepts of validation indexes and computational complexity corroborate the superiority of WTSM. The transient cluster arising from temporal dissimilarity is a unique finding of WTSM, which led to high cluster cohesion and separation. WTSM can obtain new knowledge and rationale for urgent government intervention and epidemic management, not sacrificing computational efficiency and clustering quality. With the improved storage capability and desire for multidimensional pattern extraction, the increased accessibility to the chaotic time series data sets could promote further studies and help administrative schemes.","You, Geonhwa",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS,COVID-19,mobility,multidimensional clustering,pattern detection,spatial time series data,SYMBOLIC AGGREGATE APPROXIMATION,DISTANCE,ORIGIN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 21 2023,Urban Mobility and Knowledge Extraction from Chaotic Time Series Data: A Comparative Analysis for Uncovering COVID-19 Effects

Since this proportion is expected to increase enormously, especially in African and Asian cities, the question of the impact on the development of a city arises. This paper proposes a method for determining the net mobility of slum dwellers within cities and examines it in inter- and intra-urban settings on three continents. The derived metrics are defined by taking into account the current insufficient availability of uniform slum data in cities of the Global South. The study shows differences in the mobility of slum populations in diverse cities on the different continents, as well as intra-urban differences.

Row_73,"Rapid urbanization due to fast economic development has put tremendous stress on urban infrastructure and has caused an increase in impervious surface area and runoff, resulting in flash floods in many cities in the world. In developing countries such as India, urban floods have severe impacts due to highly vulnerable population density. The normal functioning of the urban region is disrupted due to the effect of floods on the urban road network. This paper examined vehicular mobility on urban road networks under nonflood and flood conditions and identified an affected region under the flood condition. Multiple centrality assessment (MCA) was used with multiple classical metrics, such as betweenness centrality and closeness centrality, to assess the status of nodes using distance and travel time under nonflood and flood conditions. The road network under floods was generated by the Soil Conservation Service curve number (SCS-CN) and time area histogram methods using flooding depth over road network and betweenness centrality. Weighted overlay centrality layers were created to identify the regions with severely affected mobility under the flood condition by generating a ward-level vulnerability map. The Pearson's correlation analysis of centrality maps showed that network centrality is correlated strongly with the road network availability at a 95% confidence level. The study also indicates that under flood condition, high betweenness centrality decreases at the city center and closeness centrality exhibits contrasting spatial patterns. According to the ward-level vulnerability map, mobility on road networks was affected severely in 29.35% of the areas, most of which were centrally located. This research suggests that during urban planning, major roads that have greater impedance during floods should be distributed throughout the region so that mobility is less affected by floods.

As space is one of cities' scarcest resources, mobility's spatial footprint is increasingly scrutinized as externality to mitigate. Similar to passenger transport, goods transport is envisioned to shift towards efficient and zero emission mobilities. To achieve an urban logistics system that eliminates inefficiencies and fossil fuels, the logistics sector requires space to unload, cross-dock, consolidate and stock goods closer to their destinations. Such a 'proximity logistics' is however at odds with 'logistics sprawl', the historic outward migration pattern of logistics facilities. With policies and planning, cities can support the (re)integration of logistics facilities in urban areas to facilitate and enable the shift to an efficient urban logistics system. Logistics still being a largely neglected policy subject in many cities, knowledge on how to approach this (re)integration is hardly available. Therefore, we compare two pioneering cities: Rotterdam and Paris. Both cities have an established track record in advancing urban logistics policies and are spearheading the practice of planning for logistics.

A one-way ANOVA with post-hoc procedures and three multinomial logistic regression models are used to assess the extent to which transport-, land use- or socio-economic-related variables influence the likelihood of experiencing a specific mobility situation. The results show that the mobility situations of workers are primarily influenced by the socio-economic characteristics of commuters, followed by land-use patterns and the availability of transport systems, respectively.

In this paper, we use an anonymized Twitter dataset collected in Singapore from 2012 to 2016 to investigate this potential to help understand the footprints of urban neighbourhoods from both a spatial and a relational perspective.We construct home-to-destination networks of individual users based on their inferred home locations. In aggregated form, these networks allow us to analyze three specific mobility indicators at the neighbourhood level, namely the distance, diversity, and direction of urban interactions. By mapping these three indicators of the spatial footprint of each neighbourhood, we can capture the nuances in the position of individual neighbourhoods within the larger urban network. An exploratory spatial regression reveals that socio-economic characteristics (e.g. share of rental housing) and the built environment (i.e. land use) only partially explain these three indicators and a residual analysis points to the need to explicitly include each neighbourhood's position within the transportation network in future work.","Chen, Qingqing","Chuang, I-Ting","Poorthuis, Ate",,,,,,,,,,,,6,COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS,Human mobility,Location-based-services (LBS),Activity space twitter,Spatial networks,Urban Neighbourhoods,Singapore,HUMAN MOBILITY,TRAVEL,PATTERNS,TWITTER,FORM,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2021,"Entangled footprints: Understanding urban neighbourhoods by measuring distance, diversity, and direction of flows in Singapore"

This article reviews work done in the interventionist realms of landscape planning, urban design, and public policy, where attention is increasingly being paid to walking (as a matter of fact) and its often-prescriptive corollary of 'walkability' (as a matter of concern). What patterns of critical engagement are seen in work on how, why, and where people walk? I explore how (a) the so-called compact city is seen as the only context where walking and other 'soft' modes of everyday mobility meaningfully occurs, and (b) scholarly debates on self-propelled movement seem to focus too narrowly on necessary or utilitarian activity. Recreational mobilities at various temporal and spatial scales thus tend to be overlooked or ignored altogether. Drawing on the interdisciplinary explorations presented in this special issue of Mobilities, a provisional agenda for research and practice is presented.

In today's highly connected urban systems, the travel flow rhythms can help uncover the functionalities of urban spaces. For efficient land use and traffic planning, it is necessary to understand how outflows and inflows of intra-urban regions change under the impact of different land uses. Many efforts have been made to characterize flow rhythms and correlate mixed land uses with intra-urban mobility, but they are limited because they separately analyze outflows and inflows and treat land use impacts as static throughout the day. We thus introduce the concept of 'flow trace' to synthesize and compare rhythms of outflows and inflows. The geometric features of flow traces help extract spatiotemporal variations of diurnal outflows/inflows and uncover the impact of land uses on local flows at different times. Using Beijing as the study area, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of flow traces in revealing monocentric flow patterns and changes of functionalities in intra-urban regions. We also investigated how the connections between land uses and flow characteristics change within a day.

However, at the micro level, urban mobility driven by this travel mode failed to fully recover, as evidenced by significant changes in spatial and temporal mobility patterns.

Row_83,"Human mobility is of importance in supporting smart cities, urban planning and constructions of resilient environments. Previous studies on dominant mobility models (i.e., gravity and radiation models) rarely describe the refined spatiotemporal process of human mobility flow forces especially within city. To address this gap, this paper proposes a spatiotemporal flow force model (FFM) of sink/source human mobilities within city, which is derived from Navier-Stokes equation in the field of fluid mechanics. The FFM model outperforms the gravity and radiation models in modeling the refined spatiotemporal flow force process of source/sink human mobilities, in the aspect of intensity and direction of mobility flow force. Comparison results show that the gravity and radiation models in the source mobility scenario can give a rough force estimation about the total outflow from source mobility areas while without the capability of explaining the specific directions of mobility flow from source mobility areas. Pearson correlation coefficient between the intensity results of the two models and those of FFM range from 0.65 to 0.90 and direction differences between the results of the two models and FFM respectively show no clear regularity. In the sink mobility scenario, the direction of mobility flows can be estimated well by the gravity and radiation models while the intensity of mobility flow between small-scale areas within cities is susceptible to inaccuracies. Pearson correlation coefficient ranges from 0.13 to 0.59 and direction differences follow a stepped distribution from high to low within the range of 0 degrees to 180 degrees. In addition, the potential field of human mobility flow force provides a powerful tool for visually analyzing mobility flows within cities. This proposed model enriches human mobility models and is generalizable in supporting smart cities, urban planning, and constructions of resilient environments in terms of the refined spatiotemporal process of mobility flow force.","Fang, Zhixiang","Feng, Rui","Wang, Zhongyuan",,,,,,,,,,,,1,CITIES,Human mobility,Fluid mechanics,Navier-Stokes equation,Urban planning,Spatiotemporal process,Flow force,MOBILE PHONE,PATTERNS,CITIES,,,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 2024,Spatiotemporal flow force model of source/sink human mobilities within city

These heterogenous transmission patterns could stem from human mobility, yet the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. Here, we employ an agent-based model incorporating urban scaling structure to simulate fine-grained mobility and the human-to-human transmission process. Our results reveal that not only the quantity but also the scaling structure of mobility profoundly influences local transmission risk. Urban scaling structure is characterized by a widely found power-law scaling distribution of mobility volumes across different locations. By integrating this structure, our model fits reasonably well with empirical Omicron data at various spatial scales in Hong Kong. Further analyses show a positive association between the scaling index, representing the location's importance within the structure, and local transmission risks among urban areas as well as the likelihood of becoming superspreaders among local visitors. This implies that urban scaling structure could offer the first-mover advantage to a minority of places and individuals to infect earlier and thus infect more.

Row_87,"Despite the 'mobility turn' in urban studies, there is surprisingly little research into the role people's everyday movements play in driving urbanisation processes. As this paper discusses, one reason this has not occurred is because understanding this relationship requires both quantitative and qualitative knowledge, including geospatial locations and patterns as well as why people choose to move the way they do. Few studies employ mixed methods to this end; instead, many quantitative approaches focus on the use of big data and many qualitative approaches remain focused on sites themselves rather than the movements between them. This methodological gap can preclude operationalising findings and proves particularly detrimental when research is conducted into areas with high levels of poverty and inequality. In response, this paper presents a mixed-methods approach to studying urbanisation, using volunteered geographic information (VGI) to map regional-scale movements in the Gauteng City-Region (GCR). Exploiting the potential of smartphone technology, this methodology operates at the interstice of quantitative and qualitative research, describing both macro-scale mobility patterns and the micro-scale decisions behind them. Using the case study of the GCR, it highlights movement as a strategy for those living in poverty, who can utilise the entire region as a resource to subvert entrenched inequality. 'Thinking through people' suggests that a new ontology of categories describing urbanisation processes in terms of movement could connect empirical research into poverty and inequality to theory, and be used to create an epistemology of the urban from below. Thus, this paper contributes to advances in urban studies methods as well as to debates on urbanisation, relational poverty and socio-spatial inequality.","Howe, Lindsay Blair",,,,,,,,,,,,,,9,URBAN STUDIES,informality,method,mobility,planning,poverty,exclusion,transport,volunteered geographic information,PLACE,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2021,Thinking through people: The potential of volunteered geographic information for mobility and urban studies

First, we studied the low-order organization of the urban trip networks (i.e., degree distribution, cluster-degree coefficient, rich-club coefficient, and so on.). We uncover the nontrivial relationship between network density and trip distance and find that the urban trip network in Chengdu is more heterogeneous than that in New York City. Second, we investigate the meso-order organization of the urban trip networks by using community detection. The community detection results show that the community boundaries are more or less mismatched with the administrative boundaries. Finally, we detect the higher-order organizations of the urban trip networks and find some critical nodes and regions. These empirical results from the perspective of complex networks provide insight to better understand the urban structure and human mobility, and potentially amend urban planning.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Row_94,"People's exposure to high levels of sound leads to psychological annoyance and stress. This study seeks to understand and conceptualize how human daily mobilities influence urban residents' sound exposure and psychological health involving annoyance and stress in their everyday lives. Human daily mobilities are understood as people's daily movement patterns and potentials for movements. Using a mixed-method approach, data were collected from 32 participants in a mixed-housing community in suburban Beijing in China. Each participant carried a portable sound sensor and a GPS tracker and recorded activity-travel diaries for a weekday and a weekend day to track their daily space-time trajectories, measured sound levels, and details of each daily activity and trip. Further, in-depth interviews were conducted to understand participants' perceptions of urban sounds and psychological health during their daily movements. Geo-narrative analysis was used to integrate these multiple data sources and gain an in-depth understanding of participants' daily mobilities, individual sound exposures, and perceptions of sound and psychological health. This exploratory study finds that urban residents are exposed to different sound levels and sources in multiple urban geographic contexts in the course of their day. Further, this study identifies how socially vulnerable and susceptible residents encounter difficulties in escaping from high levels of sound in different urban contexts due to their space-time constraints. This study not only enriches the knowledge of how human daily mobilities can influence individual-based sound exposure and psychological health. It also highlights the need to provide better sonic environments for socially vulnerable and susceptible groups in cities.","Kou, Lirong","Kwan, Mei-Po","Chai, Yanwei",,,,,,,,,,,,17,GEOFORUM,Daily Mobilities,Space-time Constraints,Urban Sonic Environments,Noise Pollution,Geo-narrative Analysis,ROAD TRAFFIC NOISE,AIR-POLLUTION,SPACE,GEOGRAPHIES,EXPERIENCES,ENVIRONMENT,ANNOYANCE,FRAMEWORK,CYCLISTS,STRESS,,,,,,,NOV 2021,Living with urban sounds: Understanding the effects of human mobilities on individual sound exposure and psychological health
Row_95,"This study aimed to understand the age-specific internal migration patterns in Japan where more than a quarter of the population is aged >= 65 years and the national population is on the decline, focusing on the urban hierarchy. Demographic efficiency, which is the ratio of net to gross migration, was calculated for each migration flow between the levels of urban hierarchy in Japan based on the 2020 census. The results showed that the overall upward migration, which is a movement from lower to higher levels in the urban hierarchy, was dominant. A variation in migration patterns by age confirmed that young adults, especially those aged 20-24 years, moved up the urban hierarchy unidirectionally, while people of preretirement and retirement age moved down. The older adults (aged 75 and over) were inclined to move up. Regarding sex-based differences, the demographic efficiency of women was higher than that of men. Additionally, the upward movement of women was predominant in almost all age groups. These findings suggest the possibility that aggregated migration behaviours may vary by sex, which has received little attention in previous migration studies focusing on urban hierarchies in other countries. Furthermore, this study discussed policy implications based on the observed patterns, such as the impacts of older adults' migration on social security at each hierarchy level and a possible relationship between women's upward migration patterns and future fertility decline.","Kotsubo, Masaki","Nakaya, Tomoki",,,,,,,,,,,,,0,POPULATION SPACE AND PLACE,demographic efficiency,internal migration,Japan,urban hierarchy,NET MIGRATION,FERTILITY,MOBILITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,Moving up and down the urban hierarchy: Age-specific internal migration patterns in Japan based on the 2020 census
Row_96,"This article explores the territorial differences in the onset and spread of COVID-19 and the excess mortality associated with the pandemic, across the European NUTS3 regions and US counties. Both in Europe and in the US, the pandemic arrived earlier and recorded higher Rt values in urban regions than in intermediate and rural ones. A similar gap is also found in the data on excess mortality. In the weeks during the first phase of the pandemic, urban regions in EU countries experienced excess mortality of up to 68pp more than rural ones. We show that, during the initial days of the pandemic, territorial differences in Rt by the degree of urbanisation can be largely explained by the level of internal, inbound and outbound mobility. The differences in the spread of COVID-19 by rural-urban typology and the role of mobility are less clear during the second wave. This could be linked to the fact that the infection is widespread across territories, to changes in mobility patterns during the summer period as well as to the different containment measures which reverse the causality between mobility and Rt.","Natale, F.","Iacus, S.M.","Conte, A.","Spyratos, S.","Sermi, F.",,,,,,,,,,0,arXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15 March 2021,Territorial differences in the spread of COVID-19 in European regions and US counties [arXiv]
Row_97,"Housing reform in socialist China has incurred considerable restructuring and transformation of urban space and society. Yet its specific socio-spatial outcomes have not been fully investigated from the perspective of housing type at the meso-and micro-levels. This study attempts to fill the gap by examining the nature and magnitude of the consequences of housing reform and the corresponding effects on mobility. Specifically, based on census data and a mobility survey, this paper combines statistical breakdowns and structural equation modeling to capture the socio-spatial differentiation of urban structure resulting from housing reform and its influences on individual vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) and transportation walking. The results reveal that: (1) different types of housing tend to feature internally homogeneous populations in terms of socio-economic composition and sociopsychological condition, with pronounced social stratification; (2) residents in different types of housing display dramatically different travel styles, with substantial mobility inequities; (3) social differentiation appears to have spatial determinants; in particular spatial segregation contributes to increasing social exclusion; (4) the effects of spatial and social characteristics on mobility are led by housing type; and (5) individual mobility patterns are shaped by the joint influences of spatial and social dimensions of housing differentiation. The findings contribute to further understanding of socio-spatial differentiation in countries with a transitional housing market, suggesting that the design of land-use policies should recognize their social effects and that urban mobility planning practices should deliver sustainability that serves a diverse population, including in particular disadvantaged groups in public and replacement housing. This study serves as a mirror to observe the urban transition compared to other political economies and adds additional richness and diversity to the theoretical debates on the issue of socio-spatial differentiation and empirical evidence on residential and mobility inequities across global contexts.","Chen, Faan","Nielsen, Chris P.","Wu, Jiaorong","Chen, Xiaohong",,,,,,,,,,,11,HABITAT INTERNATIONAL,Housing reform,Socio-spatial differentiation,Spatial segregation,Social stratification,Mobility inequity,Vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT),Transportation walking,ACTIVITY-SPACE,RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION,ETHNIC STRATIFICATION,SOCIAL INEQUALITIES,PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY,NEIGHBORHOODS,IMPACT,TRAVEL,CITY,PERSONALITY,,,,,JAN 2022,Examining socio-spatial differentiation under housing reform and its implications for mobility in urban China

It is vital to ensure urban parks serve the communities equally, particularly during the pandemic and for traditionally disadvantaged groups. This study examined how the COVID-19 pandemic changed urban dwellers ' visitation patterns to urban parks and assessed whether the pandemic exacerbated the inequalities of urban park access among different sociodemographic groups in the U.S. We investigated urban dwellers ' visitation patterns from two aspects (origin and destination) and used a big data approach by integrating mobility data from mobile devices, remote sensing/ geospatial data, socioeconomic data, etc. This study found urban dwellers preferred visiting urban parks that were remoter, larger, greener, less crowded, less noisy, and with less human activities during the pandemic (i.e., 2020 and 2021) vs. pre -pandemic (i.e., 2019). Our results also highlighted that the pandemic exacerbated social inequalities in urban park access. The urban dwellers from block groups with higher percentages of racial/ethnic minorities, higher unemployment and poverty rates, and lower income were more negatively influenced by the pandemic and became less likely to visit urban parks.

Row_99,"After decades of sprawl and car-dependent urban developments, especially on the peripheries of metropolitan areas, new policies are being oriented towards more efficient and sustainable mobility. In the process of change towards more sustainable mobility patterns in peripheral areas, commuter railways must play a predominant role because of their capacity and speed. The main aim of this paper is to analyse commuter rail stations' catchment areas (SCAs) to identify typologies of these nodes in large metropolitan areas as a key step in proposing strategies for making mobility much more sustainable, both in the medium and proximity scales, by promoting soft mobility towards stations, a strategy that will facilitate commuters' use of daily rail transport. The method proposed is based on a twofold clustering analysis. The first is to consider urban-planning variables to detect consolidated stations; the second is to use both public space and land-use variables to characterise the quality of the urban environment for walking/cycling. These methods are applied in the metropolitan area of Madrid and offer some key insights. The results show that different typologies are found - from consolidated, dense and mixed-use SCAs, with large residential developments, to low-density SCAs in sprawl areas or low consolidated mixed-use SCAs with large parking spaces, following the park-and-ride model, among others. This identification of SCAs' typologies is key for policy makers to propose different strategies, which could be small projects oriented towards improving public spaces promoting soft mobility, or deeper changes that require a re-densification process in the stations' surroundings, breaking with the rigid definition of transit-oriented developments and adapting the decisions taken to each context.","Moyano, Amparo","Solis, Eloy","Diaz-Burgos, Elena","Rodrigo, Alejandro","Coronado, Jose M.",,,,,,,,,,1,LAND USE POLICY,Station catchment area,Disperse urban periphery,Sustainable urban environment,Transit-oriented development,Commuter railway,LAND-USE,TRANSIT,TRANSPORT,ACCESSIBILITY,DENSITY,TRAVEL,TOD,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2023,Typologies of stations' catchment areas in metropolitan urban peripheries: From car-oriented to sustainable urban strategies

Row_101,"Human mobility prediction plays a crucial role in various real-world applications. Although deep learning based models have shown promising results over the past decade, their reliance on extensive private mobility data for training and their inability to perform zero-shot predictions, have hindered further advancements. Recently, attempts have been made to apply large language models (LLMs) to mobility prediction task. However, their performance has been constrained by the absence of a systematic design of workflow. They directly generate the final output using LLMs, which limits the potential of LLMs to uncover complex mobility patterns and underestimates their extensive reserve of global geospatial knowledge. In this paper, we introduce AgentMove, a systematic agentic prediction framework to achieve generalized mobility prediction for any cities worldwide. In AgentMove, we first decompose the mobility prediction task into three sub-tasks and then design corresponding modules to complete these subtasks, including spatial-temporal memory for individual mobility pattern mining, world knowledge generator for modeling the effects of urban structure and collective knowledge extractor for capturing the shared patterns among population. Finally, we combine the results of three modules and conduct a reasoning step to generate the final predictions. Extensive experiments on mobility data from two sources in 12 cities demonstrate that AgentMove outperforms the best baseline more than 8% in various metrics and it shows robust predictions with various LLMs as base and also less geographical bias across cities.

Row_102,"The nature of urban space has long-drawn geographers' interest and David Harvey's conceptual framework of multiple spaces (i.e., absolute, relative, and relational) within cities has been widely adopted and developed. With its high spatial and temporal resolution, geospatial big data plays an increasingly important role in our understanding of urban structure. Taxi trajectory data is particularly useful in travel purpose estimation and allows for more granular insights into urban mobility due to the door-to-door nature of these trips. This article utilizes taxi trajectory data and explores the interaction among absolute space, relative space, and relational space in Harvey's framework using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Through an empirical study of Shanghai's downtown area, this paper highlights the importance of Harvey's framework in understanding cities' dynamic structure and argues for changes in urban planning and development to better coordinate land use and travel demand. We find an insignificant relationship between relative and relational space in Shanghai due to a mismatch between urban mobility and the built environment. This mismatch concentrates the transportation flow near the city's core area, transforming the polycentric structure of Shanghai's built environment in absolute space to a single-node structure in relational space. After identifying the contributing factors to this problem in Shanghai, this article suggests combining Harvey's conceptual framework of multiple spaces with geospatial big data to inform planning strategies that address the challenges of rapid urbanization.","Li, Xijing","Ma, Xinlin","Wilson, Bev",,,,,,,,,,,,11,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Travel behavior,Shanghai,Taxi trajectory,Urban structure,Network analysis,SPATIOTEMPORAL PATTERNS,TRAVEL PATTERNS,URBAN,EXPOSURE,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 2021,Beyond absolute space: An exploration of relative and relational space in Shanghai using taxi trajectory data

However, the flows of different genders and ages may show different patterns owing to various needs. Therefore, understanding the flow patterns of different groups and their relationships with the built environment is essential for creating a well-designed urban environment that meets the needs of all types of inhabitants. However, few studies have investigated the flow patterns of different groups to capture the heterogeneous effects of the built environment on different populations. This study analysed flow patterns and differences among various groups from a flow perspective and determined the impact of the built environment. The results indicated that different groups differed in flow distance, time, and spatial distribution. Moreover, built environment factors can be categorized into three types: promoting factors positively influence all groups (subway accessibility, population). Inhibiting factors negatively influence all groups (distance, transportation hubs).

The location big data obtained from human activities, which is cohesive with urban functions, provides valuable insights into human mobility patterns. However, as urban functions become highly mixed, existing feature representation structures struggle to explicitly depict the latent human activity features, limiting their applicability for detecting mixed urban functions in a supervised manner. To close the gap, this study analogizes the latent human activity features to the shape, texture, and color semantics of images, with a contrastive learning framework being introduced to extract image -based crowd mobility features for detecting mixed urban functions. Firstly, by translating human activity features into image semantics, a novel feature representation structure termed the Trajectory Temporal Image (TTI) is proposed to explicitly represent human activity features. Secondly, the Vision Transformer (ViT) model is employed to extract image -based semantics in a self -supervised manner. Lastly, based on urban dynamics, a mathematical model is developed to represent mixed urban functions, and the decomposition of mixed urban functions is achieved using the theory of fuzzy sets. A case study is conducted using taxi trajectory data in three cities in China. Experimental results indicate the high discriminability of our proposed method, especially in areas with weak activity intensity, and reveal the relationship between the mixture index and the trip distance.

Our methodology involves calibrating supervised machine-learning models that allow us to link cell phones with truck drivers. In this endeavor, we construct several input variables that track mobile phone's daily movement patterns, including traveled distances, interactions with highway networks, and land use variables. We test our approach by conducting a case study in Santiago, Chile, for which we analyze mobility patterns and logistics indicators disaggregated by day, hour, and zoning.

For example, individuals that live close to one another are more likely to be friends than chance alone predicts. Explaining this pattern, researchers often argue that distance approximates meeting opportunities: when individuals live nearby, they are more likely to meet, both by chance and deliberately.

Row_114,"Assessing the coverage of metro stations is crucial for evaluating and guiding metro construction. Existing methods mainly rely on surveys to obtain the coverage radii by fitting the first-mile distance distribution of metro passengers, which is costly and time-consuming to capture the spatiotemporal heterogeneity at the urban scale. Daily generated multi-source mobility data offers the possibility of a broad and low-cost assessment. This study proposes a framework to assess the coverage radius of metro stations using metro smart card data and Baidu population heatmap data. First, we build a nested logit model to model travelers' mode choice and station selection behaviors, considering both the competitiveness of the metro over other modes and travelers' sensitivity to first-mile distance. We then establish the relationship between choice probability and metro station inflows, calibrating the parameters through a genetic algorithm-based bi-objective optimization. Finally, we propose a novel metro station coverage assessment method using a distance-decay function that describes the cumulative mode choice proportions. An empirical analysis is conducted using Hangzhou, a sizeable monocentric city in China. The results reveal significant tidal patterns in travel behavior parameters. During the morning peak, suburban travelers rely more on the metro, whereas evening peak reliance is more pronounced among urban center travelers. This aligns with Hangzhou's commuting patterns. Moreover, significant differences occur in attraction patterns between downtown and suburban stations. Suburban metro stations exhibit larger coverage radii due to the lack of convenient alternative transport modes, a result that existing methods fail to capture. This evaluation framework can be extended to other cities, offering valuable insights for enhancing metro services.","Zhang, Guozheng","Wang, Dianhai","Chen, Mengwei","Zeng, Jiaqi","Cai, Zhengyi",,,,,,,,,,0,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Metro station coverage,First-mile distance distribution,Urban scale assessment,Spatial heterogeneity,Big data,TRANSIT,ACCESSIBILITY,MODE,TRANSPORT,DISTANCE,,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 2025,Assessing urban-scale spatiotemporal heterogeneous metro station coverage using multi-source mobility data

Heat exposure risk is dynamic in time and space due to diurnal temperature variations and population mobility, but has often been ignored in previous studies. This study assessed diurnal heat exposure risk by coupling high-temperature intensity and frequency and population density in Beijing, China, and pro-posed risk governance zoning based on the association analysis of local climate zone (LCZ) and heat exposure risk. The results indicate that although heat exposure risk is highest in the core functional area during the day and night, the gravity centre of heat exposure risk shifts eastward at night; high-risk patterns at night are similar to the population distribution. Moreover, based on the different LCZs contributing differently to high heat exposure risk, risk governance zoning that is applicable to heat exposure risk governance was developed; urgent priority governance areas account for 22.88% of the total area due to a large number of compact mid-rise and high-rise buildings. These findings could represent an important basis for developing risk mitigation strategies in urban planning, and provide effective guidance for urban residents to improve their risk adaptation capacity.","Chen, Bin","Xie, Miaomiao","Feng, Qianqian","Wu, Rongrong","Jiang, Lei",,,,,,,,,,35,SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY,Heat hazards,Heat exposure risk,Population mobility,Local climate zone,Risk governance,Beijing,HEALTH-RISK,URBAN,VULNERABILITY,TEMPERATURE,ISLAND,CITY,PATTERNS,SURFACE,STRESS,INDEX,,,,,,JUN 2022,"Diurnal heat exposure risk mapping and related governance zoning: A case study of Beijing, China"

Little research to date, however, has investigated the temporal, spatial, and social patterns in which human mobility responds to extreme temperatures from the perspective of regional heterogeneity. This study, taking the Greater Houston area in the United States as a testbed, conducted statistical and geospatial analyses to measure the unequal impacts of extreme temperatures on human mobility in cities. In particular, the changes in daily human mobility across dimensions (i.e., temperatures, spatial gradients, and social relationships) when experiencing extreme temperatures are examined. The results show that extreme heat inhibits people's willingness to make short trips, while cold weather promotes more frequent short trips. Besides, extreme temperatures impede the mobility of people near the city center while promoting movement to the suburbs. Furthermore, the areas with large numbers of disadvantaged social groups were more likely to be affected by extreme temperatures. The socio-demographic inequalities in the impacts of extreme temperatures quantified in this study could promote more scientific, targeted, and practical policy planning and implementation by local governments.","Gu, Xinyue","Chen, Pengyu","Fan, Chao",,,,,,,,,,,,6,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Extreme weather,Human mobility,Environmental equity,Climate change adaptation,Regional sustainability,URBAN HEAT-ISLAND,CLIMATE-CHANGE,PATTERNS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2024,Socio-demographic inequalities in the impacts of extreme temperatures on population mobility

Yet often transport planning strategies prioritise the smooth flow of urban commuters, while people over the age of 60 are at risk of experiencing marginalisation and inequality. In this paper, we consider the mobility patterns of a group of seniors who regularly travel by public transport to Sydney, Australia for more than an hour a day. We argue that geographical perspectives are important for understanding how disincentivising seniors from travelling at rush hour may result in a range of negative health and social outcomes. In this research we consider how seniors in fact may benefit from travelling in rush hour materially, socially, and emotionally. Drawing on the optic of mobility justice we examine the felt intensities of using public transport and the inequalities that manifest in corporeal density. This serves to highlight how agency enables people to go against policy aims to reduce senior travel at peak times and how mobility justice is a useful heuristic to dispute power dynamics in specific transport modes.","Harada, Theresa","Birtchnell, Thomas","Du, Bo",,,,,,,,,,,,7,SOCIAL & CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY,Commuting,mobilities,ageing,congestion,mobility justice,travel behaviour,TRIP-CHAINING ACTIVITY,AGING IN-PLACE,OLDER-PEOPLE,TRAVEL PATTERNS,ACCESSIBILITY,ADULTS,SPACE,PARTICIPATION,EXPERIENCE,IMPACT,,,,,,FEB 7 2023,"The rush of the rush hour: mobility justice for seniors on public transport in Sydney, Australia"
Row_118,"Numerous patterns found in urban phenomena, such as air pollution and human mobility, can be characterized as many directed geospatial networks (geo-networks) that represent spreading processes in urban space. These geo-networks can be analyzed from multiple levels, ranging from the macro-level of summarizing all geo-networks, meso-level of comparing or summarizing parts of geo-networks, and micro-level of inspecting individual geo-networks. Most of the existing visualizations cannot support multilevel analysis well. These techniques work by: 1) showing geo-networks separately with multiple maps leads to heavy context switching costs between different maps; 2) summarizing all geo-networks into a single network can lead to the loss of individual information; 3) drawing all geo-networks onto one map might suffer from the visual scalability issue in distinguishing individual geo-networks. In this study, we propose GeoNetverse, a novel visualization technique for analyzing aggregate geo-networks from multiple levels. Inspired by metro maps, GeoNetverse balances the overview and details of the geo-networks by placing the edges shared between geo-networks in a stacked manner. To enhance the visual scalability, GeoNetverse incorporates a level-of-detail rendering, a progressive crossing minimization, and a coloring technique.

To address changes in the activity areas, we design a new updating strategy that can ensure the realistic extraction of an individual's ROIs. Then, we develop an integration model for changes in the movement regularity based on two newly proposed prediction methods that consider both rapid and slow changes. The proposed integration model is evaluated based on five real-world social media datasets; three Weibo datasets related to COVID-19 collected in three Chinese cities, one Twitter dataset collected in New York and one dense GPS dataset.

Agents learn to adaptively make automated decisions for when to attempt connections and exchange information, based on a local RL model of their mobility and that of other agents they learn about from exchanges.

However, due to the expensive costs of field sampling, most existing models are established on insufficient pedestrian samples and obtain limited prediction performance. Therefore, this study proposes an enhanced learning model for pedestrian volume prediction with high spatiotemporal granularity in urban areas. The enhanced learning model is applied to a case study in the central business district (CBD) of the city of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. More than 1400 features are constructed for pedestrian estimation, covering macro aspects of transportation, socioeconomics, road networks, time, land use and place of interest. Compared with the optimal supervised learning model of LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine), the LightGBMbased enhanced learning model can significantly improve the performance of pedestrian estimation with root mean-square error (RMSE) reduced by 41.75% and R-squared (R2) improved by 27.75%. The important parameters (i.e., spatial resolution, combination parameter) of the enhanced learning model are validated to significantly affect model performance.

Some studies have attempted to incorporate them in transport poverty metrics, focussing on insufficient access to general services and employment. While accessibility measures coupled with statistics have been effective in assessing immediate households' vulnerability, we argue that an analysis of their adaptive capacity could contribute to a better information of local policies in the long term. This paper aims to develop a methodology for mapping transport poverty risks at the metropolitan scale, while studying the relation between urban segregation and the transport divide. We use the case study of Lyon to operationalise our method and find evidence of vulnerability patterns previously identified in the sociological literature.

Then, we investigated the roles of potential accessibility and neighborhoods' demographics and socioeconomic status in explaining the residents' accessibility both in the normal state and during the hurricane. Notably, our findings show that, despite a general decline in accessibility during hurricanes, our metric adeptly captures varying extents of disruption across different facilities. A surge in spatial inequity of restaurant accessibility was observed alongside reduced spatial inequity levels in grocery store accessibility. Interestingly, while normal-state grocery accessibility hinges on aspatial factors like median income and race, ""potential accessibility"" as a spatial factor emerges as the most significant determinant during the hurricane.

This study investigates population dynamics in Jiangsu Province, focusing on county-level cities to understand the factors influencing urban population size. It developed a multidimensional indicator system per 2014, 2017, 2020, and 2023 statistical data, incorporating road network accessibility, socio-economic levels, resident income, public services, and the built environment. Employing static fixed effects models and dynamic panel regression models, it analyses trends and evolutionary patterns of permanent population changes. The findings indicate an overall increase in the permanent population over the past decade, although the growth rate has slowed in the last five years. Notably, there is a significant spatial clustering of population growth and contraction, often aligned with high-speed transportation corridors. Unlike existing research findings, the urban shrinkage pattern in Jiangsu Province is unique. Some cities in northern Jiangsu exhibit a 'relative contraction' pattern, where population decline coexists with high economic growth and spatial expansion. Key short-term factors influencing population size include the city's economic level and residents' disposable income, while long-term factors encompass city level, industrial structure, and transportation networks. Small towns exhibit 'close-range mobility', with primary short-term influences stemming from residents' income, public service quality, and intercity transportation accessibility.

Row_127,"As described in the proverb ""birds of a feather flock together"", the term homophily narrates the principle that stronger spatial interactions tend to be formed among locations with similar characteristics. Taking advantage of mobility networks derived from around 45 million mobile devices in the U.S. and targeting the top twenty mostpopulated U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), we extract human mobility structures by detecting communities formed by strong spatial links and unravel the homophily effect at the community level using information entropy that measures the chaoticness of societal settings within communities. The results suggest that the power-law still, to a large extent, governs the travel patterns in MSAs. However, communities featured by strong human interactions can sometimes transcend geographic proximity in modern metropolitans. The entropy varies across communities, and a community can exhibit variation of homophily levels when different sociodemographic settings are investigated. Our study proves the ubiquity of the homophily phenomenon in modern metropolitans and documents its variation from different social perspectives from a mobility-oriented setting.

The built environment plays an important role in this sense. In this study, we aimed to investigate this association within Italian regions.Urban sprawl/sprinkling can be defined as urban patterns where large percentages of the population live in low density residential areas. It is quantified for each Italian region using the CI (Compactness Index). In the 20 Italian regions, the average obesity rate (defined as BMI >= 30) in 2021 was 9.75%. Our analysis showed a significant association of the CI with the obesity rate. People living in sprinkling areas seem to be more likely to gain weight than those living in more compact places. This could be related to the possibility of walking for daily activities. Combined with other research from public health, there is moderate support for the assertion that urban layout can have significant influences on health and health-related behaviors. Some possible developments of this project could be to define a demarcation threshold between pedestrian/cycle and motorized mobility in terms of distance and to suggest a clinical strategy to address obesity promoting active commuting, calibrated to the urban characteristics of the area.The research is fully in line with the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in particular with regard to the goals ""Good health and well-being, Gender quality and Sustainable cities and communities"".","Romano, Lucia","Sette, Camilla","Romano, Bernardino","Giuliani, Antonio",,,,,,,,,,,0,"INNOVATION IN URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING, VOL 2, INPUT 2023",Obesity,Overweight,Urban pattern,Urban sprinkling,SDGs 2030,BODY-MASS INDEX,PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY,BUILT ENVIRONMENT,SPRAWL,OVERWEIGHT,IMPACT,RISK,FORM,,,,,,,,,2024,Obesity and Its Relationship with Urban Pattern in Italian Regions

Despite its importance, our understanding on the movement predictability of urban tourists and visitors is still limited, partially due to difficulties in accessing large scale mobility observations. In this study, we aim to bridge this gap by analyzing a nationwide mobile phone dataset. The dataset captures movement traces of a large number of international travelers who visited South Korea in 2018. By introducing two prediction models, one being Markov chain and the other with a recurrent neural network architecture, we assess how well travelers' movements can be predicted under different model settings, and examine how predictability relates to travelers' length of stay and activeness in travel patterns. Since travelers' destination choices are quite diverse in South Korea, this enables us to further investigate the geographic variation of the models' performance. Results show that the Markov chain model achieves an overall accuracy between 33.4% (@Acc1 metric) and 64.2% (@Acc5 metric), compared to 41.9% (@Acc1) and 67.7% (@Acc5) for the recurrent neural network model. The prediction capabilities of both models are largely unequal across individuals, with active travelers being more predictable in general. There is a notable geographic variation in the models' performance, meaning that travelers' movements are more predictable in some cities, but less in others. We believe this study represents a new effort in portraying the movement predictability of urban tourists and visitors. The analytical framework can be applied to assist tourism planning and service deployment in cities.","Xu, Yang","Zou, Dan","Park, Sangwon","Li, Qiuping","Zhou, Suhong","Li, Xinyu",,,,,,,,,23,COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS,Location prediction,Mobile phone data,Deep learning,Human mobility,Tourist mobility,Smart tourism,LENGTH-OF-STAY,TRACKING,PATTERNS,DESTINATIONS,GPS,1ST,,,,,,,,,,MAR 2022,Understanding the movement predictability of international travelers using a nationwide mobile phone dataset collected in South Korea
Row_130,"Urban green space (UGS) is an important component of urban resources which contributes to human physical and mental health. Studies on the accessibility of UGS under the two-step floating catchment (2SFCA) framework have recently received much attention. However, the effects of people's actual mobility patterns have not been fully considered in current studies. Proposed in this study is an improved accessibility model called AM-Ga2SFCA, which refines the traditional Gaussian 2SFCA method with the actual mobility information extrac-ted from mobile phone big data and online map. A new attractiveness index of UGS is implemented by combining the popularity evaluated by the PageRank algorithm and the actual utilisation based on buffer analysis. In addition, realistic travel time between each demand point and UGS is retrieved from the online map, which is further introduced into AM-Ga2SFCA as the travel cost. A case study is conducted in Shenzhen, China to validate the proposed model. Results show that the accessibility of UGS is strongly correlated with regional urbanization level, for example, higher accessibility generally occurred in the region with developed transportation and rich green resources. From the perspective of age groups and travel modes, we found that the environmental justice issue had already occurred in Shenzhen especially for the non-elderly: under the walk mode, nearly 80% of the non-elderly only shared 20% of UGS whilst approximately 80% of the elderly shared 30% of UGS. However, taxi or private vehicles can effectively alleviate the aforementioned phenomenon by reducing the Gini index to less than 0.5.

This paper examines the everyday mobility practices and perceptions of less mobile pedestrians, i.e., older adults and people with disabilities (PWDs), through mobile ethnographic interviewing. In total, 26 older adults and 7 PWDs were recruited for go-along interviews in localities familiar to them in Singapore. These semi-structured go-alongs generated a wealth of qualitative data covering topics ranging from their travel patterns to their perceptions of the built environment and their attitudes towards space sharing. Interview transcripts, field notes and video footage enabled an in-depth analysis of both the verbal and nonverbal aspects of the active mobility behaviour. The analysis revealed emerging sociospatial themes, including movement within an extended pedestrian network, such as detouring and taking shortcuts, and ambivalence towards space sharing caused in part by unclear rights-of-way among active transport modes and preconceptions of social norms. These themes have implications for how to shape travel behaviour based on a more inclusive approach to urban planning and neighbourhood design that instils a deeper humanistic understanding.","Wang, Yongcheng","Wong, Yiik Diew","Du, Bo","Lum, Kit Meng","Goh, Kelvin",,,,,,,,,,1,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Go-along interview,Active mobility,Inclusive streets,Accessibility,Older adults,People with disabilities,IRVINE-MINNESOTA INVENTORY,MEASURE BUILT ENVIRONMENTS,PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY,WALKING,TRANSPORT,WALKABILITY,SENIORS,ACCESSIBILITY,PERCEPTIONS,BEHAVIOR,,,,,,FEB 2024,Sociospatial inclusiveness of streets through the lens of urban pedestrian mobilities: Go-along interviews with less mobile pedestrians in Singapore

Results reveal an emerging reversal from a predominantly upward pattern (e.g. most of the net flows move to high-level cities) to a downward one (e.g. from super-large/extra-large cities to large cities) in the recent migration trend. Regional disparities are significant. An upward and eastward tendency still dominates in the western, central and northeastern regions, whereas a downward and decentralised tendency has been initiated in the eastern region. The causes for the structural change include common factors found in developed countries, such as the influence of age and life courses. The age structure of China's population caused by the 'one-child' policy weakened the upward momentum and led to a strengthening downward trend in the current migration pattern. The contextual and institutional factor hukou also has a significant effect on people's migration directions.

Row_138,"Interesting sequential patterns in human movement trajectories can provide valuable knowledge for urban management, planning, and location-based business. Existing methods for mining such patterns, however, tend not to consider the reduced likeliness of trips with increasing travel cost. Consequently, it is difficult to differentiate the patterns emerging from people's specific travel interests from those simply due to travel convenience. To solve this problem, this article presents Geo-SigSPM for mining geographically interesting and statistically significant sequential patterns from trajectories. Here, 'geographically interesting' patterns are those more frequent than their expected frequencies which consider both the travel cost and non-redundancy of any place in the patterns. To achieve this, Geo-SigSPM formulates the expected frequencies of the patterns based on doubly-constrained human mobility models and the frequencies of their subsequences. A set of statistical tests is also developed to evaluate the identified interesting patterns. Experiments with synthetic and Foursquare check-in datasets demonstrate the efficacy of Geo-SigSPM in discovering geographically interesting patterns, controlling the spurious pattern rate, and discovering patterns that better reflect people's specific travel interests than the conventional frequency-based pattern mining approach. Geo-SigSPM is a promising solution to improving relevant decision-making when people's travel preference beyond travel cost is concerned.","Zhang, Anshu","Shi, Wenzhong","Liu, Zhewei","Zhou, Xiaolin",,,,,,,,,,,0,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE,Sequential pattern mining,geographical knowledge discovery,geographical information science,trajectory mining,statistical evaluation,EPISODES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 3 2024,Geo-SigSPM: mining geographically interesting and significant sequential patterns from trajectories
Row_139,"The urban transition is generally imagined as a large-scale permanent migration of people from villages to cities. The formation of new cities is also theorized as occurring through the migration of people. However, recent scholarship implies that parts of India may be witnessing an urbanization process that depends on natural population growth rather than in-migration. This claim carries significant implications for urban theory, but it has never been tested empirically. This article addresses that gap by examining migration patterns in India alongside urbanization-measured in terms of densification of population and built-up area and an economic transition away from agriculture. I find that certain parts of the country, notably the eastern Indo-Gangetic Plain, are exhibiting all the trends constitutive of urbanization even as they experience negative net migration-a phenomenon I term ""urbanization from within."" My analysis also highlights that these same regions see high rates of temporary out-migration-suggesting that human mobilities may play a role in the in situ urbanization of rural settlements, but not in the ways that foundational urban and development theories would predict. I discuss the inequalities of India's economic transition and its spatial regime of social welfare as possible causal underpinnings of the trends I observe. The article's findings suggest that urban social scientists should reevaluate long-held assumptions about the relationship between urbanization and migration in the context of 21st-century urban transitions.","Randolph, Gregory F.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE,Urbanization,migration,India,demography,economic development,TRANSFORMATION,AGRICULTURE,GEOGRAPHIES,HYPOTHESIS,POLITICS,LAND,PUSH,,,,,,,,,,FEB 2024,"Does urbanization depend on in-migration?

The present study advances that agenda by focusing on the federally funded retreat of homes and residents from flood-prone urban neighborhoods. While officially organized by rational engineering and technocratic calculations, its implementation cannot escape the racialized landscapes of U.S. cities. To illustrate, we review how a century of unequal environmental planning and housing policy has forged today's racialized urban landscapes. Then, we turn to the federal government's entrance into those landscapes via its policy of managed retreat that purchases flood-prone homes and returns them to nature. Here we draw on nationwide data to reveal the policy's increasing urban orientation. We then present evidence from Houston to reveal how the racial composition and turnover of local neighborhoods influence program implementation and subsequent relocation. While not every city may experience the same racialized patterns as Houston, they will exhibit some patterns due to the powerful social and environmental force that race has long exerted in U.S. cities. Failing to account for that force will compromise efforts to adapt effectively to climate change.","Loughran, Kevin","Elliott, James R.",,,,,,,,,,,,,19,HOUSING POLICY DEBATE,Urban environment,Urban planning,Spatial,Neighborhood,Mobility,MANAGED RETREAT,ECOLOGY,HOUSTON,STATE,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2 2022,Unequal Retreats: How Racial Segregation Shapes Climate Adaptation
Row_141,"The simulation of intercity population mobility helps to deepen the understanding of intercity population mobility and its underlying laws, which has great importance for epidemic prevention and control, social management, and even urban planning. There are many factors that affect intercity population mobility, such as socioeconomic attributes, geographical distance, and industrial structure. The complexity of the coupling among these factors makes it difficult to simulate intercity population mobility. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named the quantum harmonic oscillator model for simulation of intercity population mobility (QHO-IPM). QHO-IPM describes the intercity population mobility as being affected by coupled driving factors that work as a multioscillator-coupled quantum harmonic oscillator system, which is further transformed by the oscillation process of an oscillator, namely, the breaking point of intercity population mobility. The intercity population mobility among seven cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and its surrounding region is taken as an example for verifying the QHO-IPM. The experimental results show that (1) compared with the reference methods (the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and long and short-term memory (LSTM) models), the QHO-IPM achieves better simulation performance regarding intercity population mobility in terms of both overall trend and mutation. (2) The simulation error in the QHO-IPM for different-level intercity population mobility is small and stable, which illustrates the weak sensitivity of the QHO-IPM to intercity population mobility under different structures. (3) The discussion regarding the influence degree of different driving factors reveals the significant ""one dominant and multiple auxiliary"" factor pattern of driving factors on intercity population mobility in the study area. The proposed method has the potential to provide valuable support for understanding intercity population mobility laws and related decision-making on intercity population mobility control.","Hu, Xu","Qian, Lingxin","Niu, Xiaoyu","Gao, Ming","Luo, Wen","Yuan, Linwang","Yu, Zhaoyuan",,,,,,,,0,JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES,intercity population mobility,coupling driving factors,quantum harmonic oscillator model,probability distribution pattern,optimization strategy,MIGRATION,OPPORTUNITIES,HYPOTHESIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 2024,Quantum harmonic oscillator model for simulation of intercity population mobility

In this preliminary study, megaregions based on American commuter flow are used to study the early spread of H1N1 Type-A Influenza in 2009-from three principal cities to surrounding towns and cities.

To adapt cities for modern faculties, regular monitoring of developing infrastructures is essential. The built-up land use map derived from remote sensing images shows how cities expand horizontally across the landscape as they grow over decades. Recent studies have shown that when planning for a more sustainable future in metropolitan settings, adding vertical components in the computation of built-up is beneficial for better understanding. As illustrated in this paper, the built-up area of an urban region is extracted from high-resolution LISS IV satellite sensor image data using deep learning techniques. The height of an urban built-up is estimated from Cartosat-1 stereo images using photogrammetric methods and automatic terrain extraction. This study combines the use of a deep learning model with the use of high-resolution remote sensing data to extract the urban built up volume. The results demonstrate that the western and northwestern areas of the study region see greater changes in urban volume compared to the central business district and other parts of the city. This work demonstrates a step-by-step strategy for studying urban growth patterns. It helps in understanding urban growth, population mobility patterns, societal typology, environmental indicators.

Row_144,"By tapping into the human mobility of the urban rail transit (URT) network to understand the travel demands and characteristics of passengers in the urban space, URT managers are able to obtain more support for decision-making to improve the effectiveness of operation and management, the travel experience of passengers, as well as public safety. However, not all URT networks have sufficient human mobility data (e.g., newly-operated URT networks). It is necessary to provide data support for mining human mobility in data-poor URT networks. Therefore, we propose a method called Meta Long Short-Term Memory Network (Meta-LSTM) for passenger flow prediction at URT stations to provide data support for networks that lack data. The Meta-LSTM is to construct a framework that increases the generalization ability of a long short-term memory network (LSTM) to various passenger flow characteristics by learning passenger flow characteristics from multiple data-rich stations and then applying the learned parameter to data-scarce stations by parameter initialization. The Meta-LSTM is applied to the URT network of Nanning, Hangzhou, and Beijing, China. The experiments on three real-world URT networks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Meta-LSTM over several competitive baseline models. Results also show that our proposed Meta-LSTM has a good generalization ability to various passenger flow characteristics, which can provide a reference for passenger flow prediction in the stations with limited data.","Han, Kuo","Zhang, Jinlei","Tian, Xiaopeng","Li, Songsong","Zhu, Chunqi",,,,,,,,,,0,GEOINFORMATICA,meta-learning,Short-term passenger flow prediction,Human mobility,Urban rail transit,Newly-operated stations,ANOMALY DETECTION,DATA SETS,SCAN,PATTERNS,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2024,Meta-learning based passenger flow prediction for newly-operated stations
Row_145,"Understanding the travel behaviors and activity patterns of vulnerable people is important for addressing social equity in urban and transportation planning. With the increasing availability of large-scale individual tracking data, new opportunities have emerged for studying people's travel behaviors and activity patterns. However, the data has not been fully exploited to examine the travel characteristics of vulnerable people and their implications for understanding transport-related disadvantage. This study proposes a methodological framework based on the concept of activity space that enables a comprehensive examination of vulnerable people's spatiotemporal travel characteristics and an investigation of the geographies of transport disadvantage. Using the proposed framework, a case study that investigates the bus activities of the vulnerable population using four-month smart card data is carried out in the city of Wuhu, China. The case study suggests that vulnerable people possess distinct travel behaviors that differ considerably from the mainstream population and that the implications of transport disadvantage, as revealed by the participation in bus activities, vary across different demographic groups and across different spatial contexts. Some of the empirical insights obtained from this study also differ from conclusions drawn from previous studies and will enrich our understandings of vulnerable people's activities. Overall, the paper makes two major contributions. Methodologically, the proposed framework can overcome some of the deficiencies of activity space-based approaches for understanding transport disadvantage and contribute broadly to the studies of travel behaviors and activities patterns using individual-level tracking data. Empirically, the study identifies varying spatial and temporal implications of transport disadvantage associated with different vulnerable groups, which could further shed light on public transit planning and service design.","Zhang, Shanqi","Yang, Yu","Zhen, Feng","Lobsang, Tashi","Li, Zhixuan",,,,,,,,,,43,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Vulnerable population,Travel behavior,Activity patterns,Activity space,Smart card data,PUBLIC-TRANSIT,MOBILITY PATTERNS,ELDERLY-PEOPLE,URBAN MOBILITY,CITIES,USAGE,PARTICIPATION,CHOICE,MODEL,TRIP,,,,,,,JAN 2021,Understanding the travel behaviors and activity patterns of the vulnerable population using smart card data: An activity space-based approach
Row_146,"Problem, research strategy, and findingsThis study shares the results of a test I established of a new minibus route in Kampala with the Uganda Transport Operators Federation (UTOF). Informal transport provides the bulk of urban mobility in the Global South but may be limited in the connectivity and spatial coverage it is able to provide. I tested the effectiveness of market response by temporarily subsidizing operations in an unserved location and found that even a limited expansion of routing found passenger demand, showing a countercurrent of travel against the existing pattern of radial, central business district-to-suburb travel. Female street vendors were a particularly important previously unserved group of passengers. For operators, the study revealed that establishing new services can be difficult, requiring organizational capacity and substantial investment and risk in terms of time and money. In parallel, when such investments are made, other formal and informal actors, such as police, government bureaucracy, and competing operators, can act to extract the benefits, further slowing the change and growth of the transport network.Takeaway for practiceI describe the implementation steps and lessons learned from a small-scale pilot project that could be scaled for use as a planning intervention as well as to assess the equity of market-driven public transport and identify mobility gaps. This study expands the body of evidence on the effectiveness of informal transport systems for diverse mobility needs and spatial coverage, providing unique data and a methodological approach to address latent and hidden mobility needs for urban residents. It develops a potential avenue of intervention for regulators and planning practitioners for a cheap, light-touch intervention that collaborates with informal transport workers to expand accessibility and equity for passengers.","Kerzhner, Tamara",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION,accessibility,field experiment,gender,informal transportation,mobility of care,PUBLIC TRANSPORT,RESIDENTIAL LOCATION,MOBILITY,GENDER,TRAVEL,MARSHRUTKAS,NAIROBI,,,,,,,,,,OCT 1 2024,Creating an Informal Transport Route

Urban environments combine natural elements like topography and waterways, with various intensities of urban development. These combinations shape the spatial environment of cities and influence the diversity and persistence of urban wildlife. Insectivorous bats occur in urban areas, with urban tolerant species correlated with greater mobility and flexible roosting strategies, such as trawling bats. To understand how trawling bats use urban space, we studied patterns of land use selection in an urban population of a trawling bat, the large-footed myotis (Myotis macropus) in a subtropical city. We quantified fine-scale space use using radio telemetry over two seasons using land use categories applied in urban planning and design. Bats used urban land use types in a non-random manner, displaying a preference for green and blue space associated with the recreation land use type at both the landscape and home range scale. Tracked bats used waterways and riparian areas, as well as parkland, sportsgrounds and other green space adjacent to waterways. Trawling bats are dependent on riparian habitats, and these complex habitats are particularly vulnerable to changes to the availability of water resources associated with climate change. Maintaining spatial heterogeneity in urban planning and design by retaining and providing green space along, and adjacent to waterways, will provide a landscape mosaic for urban trawling bats to persist, facilitating climate change resilience in a specialist urban species.","Gorecki, Vanessa","Rhodes, Monika","Parsons, Stuart",,,,,,,,,,,,0,URBAN ECOSYSTEMS,Trawling bat,Urban ecology,Green space,Urban planning,MYOTIS-ADVERSUS CHIROPTERA,FORAGING BEHAVIOR,DAUBENTONS BAT,HOME-RANGE,INSECTIVOROUS BATS,HABITAT SELECTION,BIODIVERSITY,PATTERNS,VESPERTILIONIDAE,URBANIZATION,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,Urban trawling bats depend on green and blue space in a subtropical city: implications for urban planning and climate change resilience

For some communities, use is limited by physical access to the greenspace while for other communities, the characteristics of the greenspace play an important role in encouraging or discouraging use. What drives communities to use their local greenspace with respect to all other available greenspace in an urban area remains an underexplored question. To fill this gap, we leverage a large human mobility dataset to track a year of park visitation by residents across the Phoenix, AZ, metropolitan area combined with a spatial autoregressive model using spatially lagged dependent variables. Our results suggest that it is not vegetation but the presence of water features within a park that encourages higher visitation to local parks. Water features also influence visitation to parks outside a communities local area; its presence within a local park decreased how often individuals visited non-local parks as a proportion of their total park visitation.

However, migrant workers are not homogeneous, with prominent identifiable differences between generations. This current paper analyses migrant workers' leisure patterns and constraints in Guangzhou, China, with a particular focus on generational differences. Based on survey data collected in 2018, we have identified three leisure patterns, namely Transformed (i.e., higher leisure consumption and longer travelled distance for leisure), Prolonged (i.e., longer leisure time) and Traditional (i.e., lower leisure consumption, shorter leisure time and shorter travelled distance). In addition, significant generational differences are observed: first, while the Transformed Pattern is predisposed to be the new generation's choice, almost half of the first generation retains the Traditional pattern; second, the first generation tends to report more substantial leisure constraints subjectively, but their leisure patterns are contrarily more affected by objective constraint indicators, such as gender, working hours, living with family members and residential location. The new generation is more influenced by subjective constraint indicators such as their attitude towards leisure, lack of like-minded companions or mobility choices. This study contributes to the extant literature by offering a typology of leisure patterns considering multiple dimensions of leisure behaviours, and further revealing the diversification of migrant workers' leisure life in the dynamic urban context. Findings suggest that the two generations may value leisure differently, indicating inevitable lifestyle changes of the newcomers in Chinese cities. Our findings may also provide some suggestions for policymakers.","Mao, Zidan","Liu, Fangyu","Zhao, Ying",,,,,,,,,,,,0,URBAN STUDIES,generational difference,leisure behaviour,leisure constraint,migrant worker,LATENT CLASS,PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY,SOCIAL NETWORKS,CONSTRAINTS,MIGRATION,VILLAGES,LIFE,URBANIZATION,ENVIRONMENT,DIVERSITY,,,,,,,,DEC 2023,Happy city for everyone: Generational differences in rural migrant workers' leisure in urban China
Row_151,"Obtaining the characteristics of an urban ecological network structure and connectivity plays an important guiding role in the concrete implementation of ecological construction in a space. Resistance assignment is a key step in ecological network construction. However, most research ignores the diversity of land use in an urbanization environment and the difference between ecological space centres and boundaries. Taking Minhang District of Shanghai as an example, this paper puts forward an optimal evaluation method for an urban ecological network. By combining the morphological spatial pattern analysis method and graph theory, the resistance value of different urban land uses was evaluated, and the ecological network was constructed by comprehensively considering the land use types, land area, forms, and positions. The connectivity and the importance of individual nodes at four different thresholds were quantified. The results revealed that the core and the edge areas of the morphological spatial pattern analysis occupied the highest amount of space, 33.34 % and 21.92 %, respectively. In addition, there were relatively few large and high-quality ecological spaces, and the green space was seriously fragmented in the study area. The degree of structural connectivity was related not only to the area proportion of the ecological space but also to the area of connected patches. The contribution value of each node to the overall network connectivity was affected by the mobility of the species, the node area, the spatial location, and the surrounding matrix environment. This study provided a framework designed to optimize the evaluation method of an urban ecological network.

We analyzed the data collected from bike-share systems of five major Brazilian cities to investigate the aspects of cycling behavior in terms of gender. Additionally, we examined the uneven access to cycling infrastructure, considering its socio-spatial inequalities. The obtained results confirm the lack of female bike-sharing cyclists at different levels. The gender difference decreased for bike-share trips with longer durations and recreational purposes. In seaside towns, women represented a higher participation percentage in bike-share cycling, particularly in recreational areas such as parks, seafronts, and lakesides. Although cycle lanes reduced the disparity, they did not ensure the gender balance as observed in recreational areas. The proportion of female bike-share cyclists reduced in areas lacking cycle lanes and near metro-rail stations.

The results show that in each group, those who plan to stay put outnumber the potential leavers-that is, those who would prefer to live elsewhere. The main motivations to stay include a community and family attachment, as well as an aversion to the city or a lack of interest in an urban lifestyle. Having children, property and a social life in the village also contribute to staying.

Existing intra-migration literature focuses on increasing monthly incomes as the major determinant of housing mobility. Housing adjustment theory suggests that housing mobility results from experiencing normative housing deficit due to a discrepancy between housing priorities and housing conditions. A major factor in changing housing priorities is increasing monthly income. However, many renters continue to live in the same long-lease rental accommodation. A case study in a high-density Jakarta slum investigates increasing monthly incomes, changing housing priorities and the implications for housing mobility. Regression and descriptive analyses demonstrate that increasing monthly incomes and changing housing priorities do not lead to housing mobility because of strong social ties among slum inhabitants. Instead, renters mutate conventional intra-migration patterns with distinctive characteristics and housing priorities. This study complements existing literature, arguing that social relationships are essential and that public policy should seek physical improvements to neighbourhoods to ensure better living conditions.","Adianto, Joko","Gabe, Rossa Turpuk","Octavia, Nadya",,,,,,,,,,,,4,HOUSING STUDIES,Housing norms,intra-migration,rental house,slum settlement,strong social ties,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 16 2023,"Quasi-bridgeheaders: an alternative intra-migration stage for renters in Kampung Muka, Jakarta"

Findings indicate that the absence of fares, although a relative variable in modal choice, allows carers expanded activity spaces, independence from car ownership, and easier coordination of care tasks. I propose to frame accessibility as a relational process emerging from passengers' encounters and the practices adopted to navigate shared spaces. With this, I argue that understanding public transport use and experiences at a micro-level offers an intersectional and justice lens to commuter-oriented transport and neoliberal urban planning policies.","Strauli, Louise",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,MOBILITIES,Care mobilities,fare-free public transport,fare policies,gendered mobilities,mobility constraints,TIME-GEOGRAPHY,GENDER,PATTERNS,EQUITY,IMPACT,INCOME,CITY,,,,,,,,,,JUL 3 2024,"Fare-free, not carefree: care mobilities in a fare-free public transport system in Tallinn"
Row_160,"Free-floating bike sharing (FFBS) programs have been put into use in many cities around the world in an effort to provide travel convenience for local inhabitants. However, it is unclear whether the existing administrative subdivisions reflect the most plausible spatial structure for the daily movements of FFBS users. In this study, we first build a spatial interaction network based on FFBS journey data from Nanjing, China. On this basis, urban activity zones are delineated leveraging the Leiden community detection algorithm, and a set of network mea-sures are then utilized to examine the properties of these activity zones. The community detection results show that the identified activity zone borders rarely overlap with existing administrative district borders. Activity zone borders could separate FFBS travel flows more rationally than administrative district borders. In order to quantitatively explore the attenuation effect of activity zone borders on FFBS travel flows, we further subdivide the borders into various types (i.e., administrative, natural, and infrastructural borders) and construct border effect models. The regression results show that, in addition to demographic size, built environment, and distance factors, the activity zone border parameters are also revealed as important predictors of bilateral travel flows. Among the different types of activity zone borders, natural borders consisting of water bodies and mountains have the most significant attenuation effect on FFBS travel flows. The delineation of activity zones could better portray short-distance mobility patterns and urban structures, thereby providing nuanced and appropriate guidance for deliberating related policies.","Chen, Wendong","Chen, Xuewu","Cheng, Long","Liu, Xize","Chen, Jingxu",,,,,,,,,,19,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Free-floating bike sharing,Spatial interaction network,Activity zone border,Community detection,Travel flow,INTERACTION PATTERNS,COMMUNITY STRUCTURE,PUBLIC-TRANSIT,LAND-USE,USAGE,CHINA,IDENTIFICATION,TRANSPORT,DYNAMICS,MOBILITY,,,,,,,OCT 2022,Delineating borders of urban activity zones with free-floating bike sharing spatial interaction network

Modified sequential extraction method was applied to assess the exchangeable, reducible, oxidisable and residual fractions of the metals in soil samples. Quantification of the metals was performed by atomic absorption spectrometry. Various statistical methods were used to evaluate the comparative distribution and mutual relationships among the metals. In addition, risk assessment employing contamination factor, enrichment factor and risk assessment code were also carried out. Among the metals, Ca, Sr, Mn, Mg, Cd, Co and Pb exhibited significant mobility and availability whereas Zn, Fe, Cu and Cr were mainly found in the residual fraction. Most of the soil samples exhibited low risk for Fe, Zn, Cu and Cr, but medium risk was associated with Co, Mn, Pb and Cd, while Ca and Sr showed high risk in most of the cases. Similarly, Zn, Co, Sr, Pb and Cd exhibited moderately severe to extremely severe enrichment of the metals in soil.

Reconstructing the spatiotemporal spread of infections is crucial for effective disease prevention. However, the challenge arose due to limited data from surveys and testing results. As such, we utilized large-scale mobile phone data to estimate daily infections in Beijing from November 2022 to January 2023. Our study demonstrated that an individual's mobility status (staying home or going outside), inferred from long-term mobile phone signaling data, could indicate his or her infection status. Then, the inferred statuses of millions of individuals could be summed to reconstruct the citywide spatiotemporal dynamics of infections. We found that the infection incidence peaked on 21 December, and 80.1 % of population had been infected by 14 January 2023 in Beijing. Furthermore, infection dynamics exhibited significant demographic and spatiotemporal disparities, with urban centers experiencing faster initial increases compared to suburbs.

This paper addresses this issue by focusing on the unique habitat requirements of urban under- canopy bird species. We employ Species Distribution Model to simulate their potential living spaces in Shanghai and quantify their functional connectivity in urban mobility. We then use segmented linear regression models to identify turning points in functional connectivity within different buffer zones, which represent the physical width of the corridor. Our findings show that urban undercanopy birds are less sensitive to human activity and building distribution compared to surface temperature, land cover types, and vegetation canopy height. We also find that conventional linear weighting methods tend to overestimate the impact of environmental factors on undercanopy birds, leading to subtle deviations in corridor path recognition. Finally, we demonstrate that employing segmented linear regression helps to quantify the turning points of functional connectivity for each urban ecological corridor, allowing us to determine their physical width range.

Taking 366 cities in China as an example, this study proposed a novel research framework for analyzing the spatiotemporal characteristics of intercity population flows. Using AutoNavi population migration big data sets from web crawling, the spatiotemporal structure patterns of intercity travel in China from January 1st to June 30th, 2020 were extracted by using the singular value decomposition (SVD) method. Then the spatial organization patterns of intercity travel networks in China and its five major urban agglomerations were identified by the weighted stochastic block model (WSBM). The results showed that the total volume of intercity travel in China and its five major urban agglomerations experienced a process of rapid decline followed by a slow recovery, presenting a ""Vshaped"" distribution since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Three distinctive intercity travel patterns, namely the stable, holiday, and weekday-weekend intercity trip patterns, were extracted from the spatiotemporal OD matrix of intercity travel. Strong intercity travels were mainly distributed in eastern and central China, forming an intercity travel pattern in which core cities pushed and pulled each other within the national urban agglomerations. However, intercity migration flows were dominated by weak-intensity flows. Intercity trips during the holidays had a phenomenon of ""escaping from the metropolis"". Meanwhile, it had significant spatial proximity and directionality. The daily intercity trips were characterized by a remarkable periodicity with seven days as a repeat. A more interesting finding is that when weekends overlap with holidays, intercity travel on the 1-2 days before the vacations has presented an effect of ""suppression travel"". Furthermore, at the national scale, the stable intercity travel network has formed a polycentric core-periphery structure of ""Three Cores-Six Semiperipheries-Five Peripheries"". At the urban agglomeration scale, they formed respectively distinguished monocentric, bicentric, and polycentric core-periphery structures.","Wei, Shimei","Pan, Jinghu",,,,,,,,,,,,,0,CITIES,Intercity travel,Spatiotemporal pattern,Singular value decomposition (SVD),Weighted stochastic block model (WSBM),COVID-19,AutoNavi migration index (AMI),China,MOBILITY,MIGRATION,TRANSPORT,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2024,Spatiotemporal characteristics of residents' intercity travel in China under the impact of COVID-19 pandemic

The implemented architecture exploits a Convolutional Neural Network for landing patterns detection; it then performs their discrimination and, for each of them, keypoints detection and identification to feed a perspective-n-point solver. The resulting pose measurements are input to an Extended Kalman Filter, which also processes data from an Inertial Measurement Unit and a Global Navigation Satellite System receiver.

Using a qualitative approach, this paper investigates how different geographies of place affect women's practices for social interaction and physical activity. This research is based on primary data collection through interviews and transect walks in Moradab Hill, which is an informal settlement in Iran. The research shows that unlike the studies that emphasise the benefit of parks, in this case women's social life flourished on streets and in private and semi-private everyday places such as shops, areas around houses, and workplaces. The results show a considerable difference in the impact of different urban fabrics on women's practices. Fine urban grain with small accessible shops increased women's perception of safety and visibility on streets. It allowed practices of social greetings and mobility. Self-built single-family houses encouraged outdoor social practices with neighbours. Conversely, those women who were moved to high-rise buildings in the same area as part of the neighbourhood regeneration found themselves restricted by high-rise typology and felt unsafe or uncomfortable going outside or to the parks.

While previous studies have integrated multi-source data for classification, few have considered both the spatial proximity of functional regions and their functional relationships reflected by crowd mobility. To address this gap, we propose a heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) approach that integrates metro passenger flow data with points of interest (POIs) and buildings. Initially, we constructed a heterogeneous graph with blocks and metro stations as nodes, connected based on their spatial proximity and crowd flow interactions. Subsequently, the building morphological and POI categorical features and crowd mobility features were used as the descriptive features of the block and metro station nodes, respectively. Finally, an HGNN model is designed to process the graph and classify the block functional types using a semi-supervised learning method. Experiments on the datasets of Beijing City indicate that our proposed approach achieved an accuracy of 81.56%.

The results show that at the level of urban land use evolution intensity, Beijing > Tianjin > Hebei, and the evolution of urban land use showed an obvious pattern of concentration of resources in central cities (districts) and weak development in sub-central cities (counties). The overall level of urban sprawl showed a downward trend, and only 0.50% of districts and counties were in the stage of high sprawl.

A larger part of the Indian population living in small to medium and large towns and cities have been facing serious problems of traffic congestion and vehicular transportation in urban areas. Consequently, urban road and street networks have occupied a core position in the functioning of cities. Therefore, assessment of the topological patterns of road infrastructure is crucial for improving the performance of transportation since the spatial pattern of the current road networks have greatly impacted the urban mobility. This paper attempts to analyze the topological patterns of road networks of small and medium-sized Indian cities in terms of connectivity and coverage measures using graph theory. Cities have been prioritized with respect to population ranging from 20,000 to 0.5 million. As a result, 505 such cities were selected in this study. The road maps of individual cities were split into lines at intersections, which were then converted to network with attribute parameters such as number of edges and vertices, and were subsequently used to compute topological (connectivity and coverage) measures such as Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Grid Tree Pattern (GTP), Eta indices, Network Density (ND), Edge Graph Density (EGD) and Nodal Graph Density (NGD). The study revealed that on an average, only 41% of the small and medium-sized Indian cities have greater connectivity (for example, Alpha > 0.8) and only 5% cities have network density higher than 5 km. This indicates that the road and street networks are not distributed evenly throughout the Indian cities. Furthermore, smaller cities that are located close to/near large metropolitan cities have higher connectivity and coverage, whereas smaller cities placed far away from metropolitan areas have less development in the road transportation systems.","Thottolil, Rahisha","Kumar, Uttam",,,,,,,,,,,,,0,IGARSS 2023 - 2023 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM,Road network,topology,connectivity,coverage,Open Street Map,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023,TOPOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION OF SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED URBAN ROAD NETWORKS - A CASE STUDY OF INDIAN CITIES
Row_176,"Transit-oriented development (TOD) is a planning strategy to encourage the use of public transportation by clustering urban development centering on transit stations with dense and diverse land uses. TOD typology is important information for the urban planner to monitor and improve the TOD. However, many studies have focused only on static features such as land use and population density around the transit station. Such analysis does not reflect dynamic features based on human mobility patterns. This study focuses on a series of processes that evaluate the activity-based TOD typology of the transit station based on smart-card data. To consider the context of multimodal transit system, transit station areas consisting of one subway station and multiple bus stops are created and clustered according to the proportion of the identified activities. Passengers' trip-chain with missing activities are clustered by applying a hidden Markov model (HMM), and the activities are identi-fied through land use and temporal patterns. Interpretation of each cluster is made through spatio-temporal patterns. The results provide six types of identified activities that are well aligned with general expectations. The transit station areas in Seoul, which were clustered with six identified types, describe the urban spatial structure, which is spatially distributed around a business district in order of mixed and residential zones. Also, the same category of clusters shows different functions depending on temporal patterns, indicating the need for consideration of dynamic features.

The use of the SCD may improve the understanding of transit users' travel patterns from precarious settlements areas, where the residents have historically limited access to opportunities and are usually underrepresented in surveys. In this paper, we explore smart card data mining to analyze the temporal and spatial patterns of the urban transit movements from residents of precarious settlements areas in Sa tilde o Paulo, Brazil, and compare the similarities and differences in travel behavior with middle/high-income-class residents. One of our concerns is to identify low-paid employment travel patterns from the low-income-class residents, that are also underrepresented in transportation planning modeling due to the lack of data. We employ the k-means clustering algorithm for the analysis, and the DBSCAN algorithm is used to infer passengers' residence locations. The results reveal that most of the low-income residents of precarious settlements begin their first trip before, between 5 and 7 AM, while the better-off group begins from 7 to 9 AM. At least two clusters formed by commuters from precarious settlement areas suggest an association of these residents with low-paid employment, with their activities placed in medium / high-income residential areas.

By analysing population data from 1959 to 2022, the study identifies the period when rural mobility emerged as the dominant demographic trend. Subsequently, it examines the impact of rural mobility on demographic changes, socio-economic shifts, and housing dynamics in both the ski and non-ski tourism areas of Kutchan during this period. The findings reveal that rural mobility has been the primary factor affecting Kutchan's demographic structure since 2000. From 2000 to 2010, highly educated foreign residents supplanted local Japanese residents with basic education, sparking a rise in housing prices and a transition from small entrepreneurs to large institutions in the ski tourism area. From 2015 to 2020, the influx of large institutions and capital associated with transnational migrants caused a significant rise in housing prices, thereby accelerating the displacement of Japanese residents throughout Kutchan. These social and spatial changes align with the patterns of gentrification. This empirical study contributes to existing scholarship by emphasising the significant temporal and spatial impact of rural mobility in Japan within the context of globalisation.","Yan, Ni","Matarrita-Cascante, David","Sakamoto, Keisuke","Yamazaki, Takahiro","Yokohari, Makoto",,,,,,,,,,5,HABITAT INTERNATIONAL,Rural mobility,Social and spatial impacts,Globalisation,Japan,Kutchan,LIFE-STYLE MIGRATION,AMENITY MIGRATION,COUNTER-URBANIZATION,SUPER-GENTRIFICATION,LINKED MIGRATION,NATURAL AMENITY,GLOBALIZATION,COUNTERURBANISATION,DISPLACEMENT,COUNTRYSIDE,,,,,,,NOV 2023,"Rural mobility and socio-spatial impacts in Japan: A case study of Kutchan, Hokkaido"
Row_181,"The analysis of urban seismic sources offers valuable insights into urban environments, including seismic hazards, infrastructure conditions, human mobility, and cultural life. Yet, accurate detection and localization of seismic sources at the urban scale with conventional seismic sensing networks is unavailable due to the prohibitive costs of ultra-dense seismic arrays required for imaging high-frequency anthropogenic seismic sources. Here, we leverage existing fiber-optic networks as a distributed acoustic sensing system to accurately locate urban seismic sources and estimate how their intensity varies with time. By repurposing a 50-kilometer telecommunication fiber into an ultra-dense seismic array with 50,000 channels, we generate high-resolution spatiotemporal maps of seismic source power (SSP) across San Jose, California. Our approach overcomes the proximity limitations of urban seismic sensing, enabling accurate localization of remote seismic sources generated by urban activities. Examples of detected activities are vehicle movements and operations at construction sites and schools. We also show strong correlations between SSP values and noise level measurements, as well as various persistent urban features, including point of interest density, land use patterns, and demographics. Our study shows how spatiotemporal SSP maps can be turned into novel urban data that effectively captures urban dynamics across multiple features, thus opening the way towards the use of fiber-optic networks as a ubiquitous and general-purpose urban sensing platform, with wide-ranging applications in urban and environmental studies.","Liu, J.","Li, H.","Noh, H.Y.","Santi, P.","Biondi, B.","Ratti, C.",,,,,,,,,0,Urban Sensing Using Existing Fiber-Optic Networks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024,Urban Sensing Using Existing Fiber-Optic Networks

However, advanced spatial analysis is increasingly employed for identifying urban types, as it offers an analytical approach to analyze urban form. This research aims to: 1/ explore the types of urban form (i.e. streets, buildings, land uses) in Athens using an open-data methodological framework that incorporates clustering and spatial analysis, 2/ assess the validity and value of the methodology and its results as research output and as a potential planning support tool via spatial virtual focus groups with 20 local experts from the fields of typo-morphology, urban planning, sustainable mobility, urban geography, and urbanism in general. The results, as evaluated by the expert focus groups, show that the methodology successfully describes the diverse character of Athens at the neighbourhood level, while it is helpful in the first stages of planning interventions. A vital aspect of this research is the exclusive use of open datasets readily available for European cities, resulting in a replicable methodology for comparatively analyzing the urban form of European cities. Another contribution is conceptualising a spatially-enabled focus group facilitating interaction among a diverse panel of experts related to the multidisciplinary field of urban morphology. Finally, an essential aspect of this work is that it adopts a mixed-method research approach, employing advanced geospatial techniques for identifying the urban types while utilizing the qualitative method of focus groups to assess the validity and value of the result.","Paraskevopoulos, Yannis","Bakogiannis, Efthimios",,,,,,,,,,,,,0,"PRAXIS OF URBAN MORPHOLOGY, PT 2",urban form,typo-morphology,focus group,open data,spatial analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023,The urban form types of Athens as identified by an open data methodological framework: Assessing the validity and value of the results by expert focus group
Row_183,"Traffic crashes are geographical events, and their spatial patterns are strongly linked to the regional characteristics of road network, sociodemography, and human activities. Different human activities may have different impacts on traffic exposures, traffic conflicts and speeds in different transportation geographic areas, and accordingly generate different traffic safety outcomes. Most previous researches have concentrated on exploring the impacts of various road network attributes and sociodemographic characteristics on crash occurrence. However, the spatial impacts of human activities on traffic crashes are unclear. To fill this gap, this study attempts to investigate how human activities contribute to the spatial pattern of the traffic crashes in urban areas by leveraging multi-source big data. Three kinds of big data sources are used to collect human activities from the New York City. Then, all the collected data are aggregated into regional level (ZIP Code Tabulation Areas). Geographically Weighted Poisson Regression (GWPR) method is applied to identify the relationship between various influencing factors and regional crash frequency. The results reveal that human activity variables from multi-source big data significantly affect the spatial pattern of traffic crashes, which may bring new insights for roadway safety analyses. Comparative analyses are further performed for comparing the GWPR models which consider human activity variables from different big data sources. The results of comparative analyses suggest that multiple big data sources could complement with each other in the coverage of spatial areas and user groups, thereby improving the performance of zone-level crash models and fully unveiling the spatial impacts of human activities on traffic crashes in urban areas. The results of this study could help transportation authorities better identify high-risky regions and develop proactive countermeasures to effectively reduce crashes in these regions.","Bao, Jie","Yang, Zhao","Zeng, Weili","Shi, Xiaomeng",,,,,,,,,,,26,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Human activities,Multi-source,Crashes,Spatial pattern,Big data analysis,DEEP LEARNING APPROACH,SAFETY ANALYSIS,HUMAN MOBILITY,PREDICTION,REGRESSION,PATTERNS,TWITTER,MODELS,RISK,,,,,,,,JUN 2021,Exploring the spatial impacts of human activities on urban traffic crashes using multi-source big data
Row_184,"Inequities that individuals and groups experience among transport and access opportunities remain unresolved. The systemic nature of these inequities suggests they will be reproduced even in new, innovative mobility systems intended to solve disparities. To better understand how the reproduction of inequities in transportation systems innovations might be prevented, theories of equity are reviewed and used to conduct a comparative analysis of a set of policies devoted to electric micromobility (EMM) devices (e-bikes and e-scooters) in 16 US cities. The focus of the analysis is on whether and how the policies used to pilot and implement EMM and other shared mobility systems address equity concerns. Our results reveal that cities at the forefront of piloting EMM systems have provided useful lessons to others further behind the implementation curve. These lessons are of many types, including co-learning with other agencies, conducting research and pilots in advance of developing and enacting EMM policies or service models, and responding to equity demands. Our findings also suggest that policies for EMM devices tend to over-rely on public safety concerns to motivate their enactment. We contend that mobility equity stakeholders should reframe such public safety concerns within broader policy discourses around mobility inequities/injustices and their mitigation strategies, which must be explicitly delineated in the implementation plans and regulations for EMM and other urban shared mobility systems.","Boamah, Emmanuel Frimpong","Miller, Maya","Diamond, Joshua","Grooms, Wes","Hess, Daniel Baldwin",,,,,,,,,,0,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Equity,Justice,Micromobility,Mobility,Policy,Planning,Transport,SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY,SOCIAL EQUITY,TRANSPORTATION,JUSTICE,PATTERNS,LONDON,CHOICE,INCOME,BIKES,,,,,FEB 2024,The long journey to equity: A comparative policy analysis of US electric micromobility programs

One such prominent result of global warming is the adverse effect of outdoor weather on pedestrians at night. To investigate this rather overlooked effect, we carried out a large-scale field study in 232 different locations in three different cities in Israel-Tel Aviv-Yafo (106 locations), Haifa (49 locations), and Beersheba (77 locations). The study, involving 30,216 observations on the feeling/s of safety (FoS) performed by 491 participants, started in August 2019 and lasted almost one year. As the study reveals, people feel safer, with all other factors being constant, when the temperature is moderate and humidity is high. According to the study findings, if temperature increases from 25 degrees C to 30 degrees C, illumination should be increased by similar to 20 lx to maintain the same level of FoS. However, if the temperature drops, less illumination can be supplied, which makes a case for smart illumination policies. As providing sufficient FoS is important for an active life outdoors, this study generates knowledge that can help support active and secure mobility in urban areas and beyond. As temperatures rise and humidity patterns change, our findings may have broad implications for urban areas worldwide, both in Israel and beyond.","Saad, Rami","Portnov, Boris A.","Kliger, Doron",,,,,,,,,,,,0,SUSTAINABILITY,feeling of safety (FoS),pedestrians,weather,nighttime illumination,active mobility,urban areas,CRIME,FEAR,IMPACT,INCIVILITIES,PERCEPTIONS,COMFORT,DESIGN,LIGHT,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,The Feeling of Safety by Pedestrians at Night: An Overlooked Aspect of Climate Change?

Using carsharing data from 61 cities in China, we analyzed the usage and efficiency of each city and investigated the impact of system and urban factors on the service performance. The study reveals vast differences in carsharing supply and demand across Chinese cities. Our results show the parking station density and the parking lot to vehicle ratio of the carsharing system are positively related to the usage. Urban factors such as public transportation availability, educational attainment levels, and vehicle restriction policies, are found to have significantly positive associations with the carsharing usage. However, no urban factors demonstrate significant associations with the efficiency measured by vehicle utilization rate. Moreover, the presence of other competing carsharing services within a city exhibits a positive impact on the performance of carsharing systems. This study also examined nonlinear effects of the factors. It provides valuable insights into the management of carsharing services in China, which can inform policy-making and operational strategies for sustainable development of carsharing.","Zu, Jinyan","Kong, Hui","Xu, Yang","Zhang, Xiaohu",,,,,,,,,,,0,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Carsharing,Vehicle utilization rate,System characteristics,Urban factors,MOBILITY IMPACTS,PUBLIC-TRANSIT,USERS BEHAVIOR,CAR,ADOPTION,DEMAND,SWITZERLAND,PATTERNS,SERVICES,PROGRAM,,,,,,,,MAY 2024,Carsharing in China: Impact of system and urban factors on usage and efficiency
Row_187,"Regionalisation is a hallmark of Australia's approach to international migration, reflecting governments' growing concern with where new arrivals live. Residence in regional Australia is encouraged (mandated, for some visas) in response to urban population pressures alongside rural population and economic decline. Parallel to regionally focused visa schemes exists a pattern of voluntary urban-to-rural migration among some international migrants. Such secondary mobility counters the policy logic that international migrants only live outside cities when required to do so. This paper explores 18 African migrants' motivations for 'urban flight': Australian cities have failed to sustain their well-being and they consider rural life a remedy. Their preference for rural locations is not purely instrumental, it is shaped by deep-seated affective connections. Given the challenges of regional population retention, settlement policies should be recalibrated to support the aspirations of international migrants who feel an affinity for rural places, rather than compelling the rural settlement of others who do not.","Klocker, Natascha","Hodge, Paul","Dun, Olivia","Crosbie, Eliza","Dufty-Jones, Rae","McMichael, Celia","Block, Karen","Piper, Margaret","Musoni, Emmanuel","Ford, Lynda","Jordan, Carly","Radford, David",,,18,POPULATION SPACE AND PLACE,counter‐,urbanisation,humanitarian migration,migrants,refugees,regional settlement,secondary settlement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2021,Spaces of well-being and regional settlement: International migrants and the rural idyll

In contemporary China, significant differences exist in child poverty between urban and rural regions, despite the remarkable achievements that have been made in child poverty reduction. Using the national datasets of China Family Panel Studies, this study explored the spatio-temporal changes and influencing factors of urban-rural disparity in child poverty (URDCP) in China between 2010 and 2018 based on the Alkire-Foster approach, spatial autocorrelation analysis and Geodetector method. Results indicated that the URDCP has been shrinking since 2010 and that the urban-rural gap in child poverty increased from east to west due to the combined influence of urban-rural differences and regional poverty disparity. The urban-rural differences in child poverty were mainly reflected in the dimensions of nutrition and living standards. Generally, family conditions, mobility and medical resources were the main contributors of spatial variations in URDCP.

Individual-level data enable us to reveal that the distribution of migrants among destinations and origins has become considerably balanced over the decade, although destinations are markedly more concentrated than origins. The migration network is stable but also becomes significantly disperse owing to the increasing short-distance and intra-provincial migration.

Row_190,"As cities grapple with the escalating challenges of urban heat and its impacts on vulnerable populations, particularly older adults, green spaces are increasingly promoted as effective urban cooling solutions. However, despite the extensive literature on people's access to and preferences for urban green spaces, little is known about the perception and use of these spaces as nature-based climate shelters on hot days, especially by older adults. This study focuses on Barcelona, a Mediterranean city facing rising temperatures, to explore older adults' patterns of use and preferences for urban green spaces on hot days. The research aims to: 1) analyze heat coping behaviors, emphasizing visits to urban green spaces; 2) identify crucial characteristics of green spaces for older adults; and 3) assess variations in behaviors and preferences based on socio-demographic factors. The study leverages survey data from 291 older adult residents, combining face-to-face and online formats. Results indicate that 54 % of older adults use urban green spaces for cooling on hot days, with preferences for morning or evening visits. Factors influencing non-visitation include perceived lack of thermal comfort, noisiness or crowdedness, and proximity issues. Alternative heat coping strategies include staying at home, traveling to cooler areas outside the city, visiting blue spaces, or air-conditioned indoor facilities. Preferred green space characteristics include abundant shade, leafy vegetation, accessibility factors (e.g., walkability), urban furniture (e.g., benches), and water features. Socio-demographic differences reveal higher green space use among younger age groups and residents in certain districts. Mobility limitations and lower education levels influence preferences, with mobility-challenged individuals prioritizing accessibility aspects. Lower-educated respondents are more likely to report barriers to accessing green spaces. These findings highlight the need for tailored urban planning strategies, considering sociodemographic variations, to mitigate heat-related health risks for older adults. By prioritizing green space accessibility, enhancing its quality, promoting its cooling benefits, addressing cooling inequalities and integrating climate considerations in urban green planning, cities facing increasingly pressing heat challenges can create climate-resilient and inclusive green environments that prioritize the well-being of their aging populations.","Vasconcelos, Luma","Langemeyer, Johannes","Cole, Helen V.

Studies quantifying disaster resilience commonly focus on evaluating physical performance of infrastructure systems, often cannot capture their capacity that maintain available service to meet citizens' demands. This paper proposes a flowbased framework for quantitively measuring resilience by regarding changes in service availability to critical facilities as a primary measurement outcome. Through the utilization of multilayer networks, we effectively incorporate diverse datasets pertaining to population demographics, residential areas, critical facilities, and the roadway network. This integration enables us to simulate the intricate dynamics of public service flows within dynamic urban systems, thereby evaluating resilience levels and accurately mapping the spatial distribution patterns. The methodology was validated in Shanghai by quantifying regional variations in healthcare services under pluvial flood scenarios. The research findings highlight the heterogeneous redistribution of service flows during extreme events, leading to spatial variations in resilience outcomes, irrespective of the proximity to hazard-prone areas. The spatial clustering of vulnerable communities demonstrates a close association with mobility correlation patterns, which are strongly influenced by the distribution of facilities and the connectivity of the road network. Thus, using the framework offers valuable insights into risk mitigation and planning of critical facilities in extreme situations. It enhances the understanding on how urban resilience to disaster is influenced by urban form and flow interactions, generating robust evidence for policy.","Li, Zihao","Yan, Wentao",,,,,,,,,,,,,6,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,Urban resilience measurement,Flow of public services,Multilayer spatial networks,Disaster simulation,Community vulnerability,STREETS,MODEL,FORM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,APR 2024,Service flow changes in multilayer networks: A framework for measuring urban disaster resilience based on availability to critical facilities

It emphasizes the ability to capture the interaction dependencies among the travel demand of buses, metros, and taxis. Firstly, a multiview graph consisting of bus, metro, and taxi views is constructed, with each view containing both a local and global graph. Secondly, a multiview attention-based temporal graph convolution module is developed to capture spatiotemporal and cross-view interaction dependencies among different transport modes. Especially, to address the uneven spatial distributions of features in multiview learning, the cross-view spatial feature consistency loss is introduced as an auxiliary loss.

I also focus specifically on people at the station whose behaviour differs from a 'typical passenger'. Instead of entering the station and heading to platforms, the ones I call 'non-passengers' do not ride the subway, do not arrive there by subway and remain at the station for long periods. To study the uses of space, I suggest an investigation framework that allows a focus on how these free access areas and their publicness are a product of these specific uses. The paper is based on Lefebvre's dialectic assumption on space, particularly his analytical triad of 'perceived', 'conceived' and 'lived' spaces, and Frehse's specific definition of uses (patterns of bodily behaviour and social interactions). I then investigate what the non-transit uses of non-passengers can reveal about the Se subway station in downtown Sao Paulo by studying them in every aspect of Lefebvre's triad, thus revealing conceived, perceived and lived uses of the station. Finally, I conclude that the 'non-passengers' use the station in similar ways to a public square and that the 'publicness' of this station lies in the relation of its non-transit uses with the Se square placed above the station.","Martin, Cristiana",,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,URBAN STUDIES,public spaces,Sao Paulo,social interactions,subway stations,uses of spaces,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2023,Urban mobility infrastructures as public spaces: The uses of Se subway station in downtown Sao Paulo
Row_195,"Commuting flow prediction is a crucial issue for transport optimization and urban planning. However, the two existing types of solutions have inherent flaws. One is traditional models, such as the gravity model and radiation model. These models rely on fixed and simple mathematical formulas derived from physics, and ignore rich geographic semantics, which makes them difficult to model complex human mobility patterns. The other is the machine learning models, most of which simply leverage the features of Origin-Destination (OD), ignoring the topological nature of the interaction network and the spatial correlation brought by the nearby areas. In this paper, we propose a 'preprocessing-encoder-decoder' hybrid learning model, which can make full use of geographic semantic information and spatial neighborhood effects, thereby significantly improving the prediction performance. Specifically, in the preprocessing part, we divide the study area into grids, and then incorporates features such as location, population, and land use types. The second step of the encoder designs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to achieve the fusion of neighborhood features, constructs a spatial interaction network with the grids as nodes and the flows as edges, and then uses the graph convolutional network (GCN) to extract the embeddings of the nodes. In the last step of the decoder, a random forest regressor is trained to predict the commuting flow based on the learned embedding vectors. An empirical study on a commuter dataset in Beijing shows that our proposed model is approximately 20% better than XGBoost (state-of-the-art), thus proving its effectiveness.","Yin, Ganmin","Huang, Zhou","Bao, Yi","Wang, Han","Li, Linna","Ma, Xiaolei","Zhang, Yi",,,,,,,,27,GEOINFORMATICA,Human mobility,Commuting flow,Hybrid learning,Graph neural network,Geographical semantics,Neighborhood effects,MOBILITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,APR 2023,ConvGCN-RF: A hybrid learning model for commuting flow prediction considering geographical semantics and neighborhood effects

Furthermore, the introduced work utilizes generative adversarial networks to automatically update the map layout, which will ultimately facilitate the process of maintaining proper map layouts. To decrease the noisy patterns created during translation, a controller or manager that oversees the meaning and interpretation of information at a conceptual or abstract level is presented in the study.

Among various research domains, the extraction of users' movement patterns is an important issue that is yet to be addressed. While many previous studies have analyzed human and animal movements from a predominantly geometrical point of view, additional semantics are still required to provide a better understanding of the patterns that emerge. User activity data provide important information resources to analyze and predict movement patterns in urban environments. This study introduces a computational framework that combines the geometric and activity-based dimensions of human trajectories. First, the geometrical dimension considers a series of parameters (i.e., turning points, curvature, and self-intersection) that are extracted by a convex-hull algorithm and characterizes a given trajectory. Second, user activity transitions are modeled and then denote some recurrent patterns. Finally, geometric and activity patterns are integrated into a unified trajectory modeling framework. This favors the analysis of human movement patterns by taking into account the geometric and activity dimensions. The entire approach and framework have experimented with the LifeMap Korean trajectory data set commonly considered as a reference benchmark.

Dakar's coastal fishing communities and the landfill site, Mbeubeuss, areas where internal rural migrants move to seek employment, are taken as case studies of waste(d) spaces and complex mobilities. Once seasonal, these historical rural to urban mobility patterns are shifting through the combined impacts of the climate crisis and socio-economic structural factors destroying agricultural livelihoods. Concomitantly, Dakar's fishing ecosystem is itself impacted by the climate crisis, ocean grabbing, rapid urbanisation, as well as waste, leading some people to feel they have 'no choice' but to risk their lives crossing the Atlantic Ocean to Europe.

Row_199,"Vehicle-borne laser scanning (VLS) and backpack laser scanning (BLS) are two emerging mobile mapping technologies for capturing detailed spatial information near ground in urban built environments. BLS has flexible mobility and usually provides point clouds in a local coordinate system. Therefore, a mismatch between VLS and BLS point cloud data is quite common. Fusing VLS and BLS data in different coordinate systems could provide a comprehensive survey of urban built environments. Because of the complexity of urban road environments and the difference in data acquisition methods, traditional registration approaches based on point-level correspondences are likely to fail and sometimes involve substantial manual efforts. In this article, we propose a novel registration approach that finds the optimal transformation between the respective point clouds based on a unique tree distribution pattern defined by tree trunk centers. The proposed method consists of three key steps, i.e., trunk center extraction, stepwise minimum spanning tree (MST) matching, and transformation estimation. Stepwise MST matching is an essential step in finding the one-to-one correspondences using a topological similarity between the two light detection and ranging (LiDAR) datasets. We evaluated our method with five real-world datasets collected in Shanghai, China. The results showed that the proposed method performed well in all five experiment sites with an average rotation error of less than 0.06 degrees and an average translation error of less than 0.05 m. Moreover, the reported mean position deviation in the five sites is 0.112, 0.144, 0.176, 0.148, and 0.184 m.

Row_200,"In the realm of smart cities, understanding citizens' activity patterns is essential for effective urban planning and development. Weather condition plays a crucial role in shaping citizen's activities. This study investigates the impact of weather conditions on activity patterns by examining variations in visitor numbers at three types of sites in Guangzhou, China: parks, pedestrian streets and shopping malls, representing outdoor, semi-outdoor and indoor urban environment, respectively. Mobile phone signaling data and meteorological data were collected over two months, July and January 2022, representing the typical summer and winter conditions. With hourly visitor counts for the selected locations scaling to the magnitude of millions, the dataset offers significant representativeness. Our findings underscore that, predominantly temperature, exerts a marked influence on the choice of activities among Guangzhou's populace. As temperature rose, even during the hot summer month, the total number of visitors across the three types of locations increased. However, the frequency of park visitors exhibited heightened sensitivity to meteorological variations in comparison to their counterparts in pedestrian streets and shopping malls, with park visitor numbers in winter oscillating over a six-fold range due to climatic shifts. In contrast, the trend of visitor number to pedestrian streets and shopping malls tends to be less affected by weather conditions. Notably, the impact of weather on activity patterns varied among different groups. Males appeared more attuned to external conditions than females, with their presence in parks surging more noticeably with temperature increments-a gender ratio surpassing 1.7 in summer, further accentuating in winter. This starkly contrasts the gender ratios in pedestrian streets and malls, which aligned closely with the city's overall demographic distribution. Age emerged as another differentiating factor. Younger individuals (19-29 years) demonstrated a higher adaptability to the local high-temperature weather conditions, while during the winter season, a significant decrease in the number of visitors from this group was observed as the temperature dropped. Remarkably, within a narrow temperature bracket of 27 degrees C to 27.5 degrees C, the hourly count of visitors aged 19-29 on pedestrian streets experienced a six-fold variance, ranging from just over 0.1 million to nearly 0.7 million. This suggests that factors beyond weather play a significant role in influencing the mobility choices of young adults. In contrast, the 30-39 age bracket showcased more robust correlations with weather patterns. The number of older visitors remained relatively stable and did not change significantly with weather changes, especially those aged 60 and above.

Row_201,"The Segregation Index quantifies the degree of segregation of social groups or classes. Because of the increasing use of fine-grained spatiotemporal activity and flow data, the conventional segregation measurements' inclusiveness is challenged. We add population flow to the conventional place-based spatial exposure index to identify spatiotemporal segregation changes. Specifically, we considered the population-flow network, hierarchical structure, and time. In Chicago's demonstration case study, we first used the time-dependent Twitter Origin-Destination flow matrices and their hierarchical structure information to estimate interactions between areal units at the neighborhood level. Then we computed the new population composition of units based on their interactions with other units and estimated the proposed spatiotemporal exposure index for different times. Finally, we systematically compared their differences with the conventional indices at global and local scales to see how population-flow patterns affect the exposure index. The results show that the population-flow patterns reflect valuable information in neighborhood interactions in temporal and spatial dimensions, but it is missing information in the conventional segregation computations. Furthermore, we emphasize that the hierarchical structures of flow patterns and the choice of appropriate parameters are also important factors for a rational segregation evaluation.","Liu, Qingsong","Liu, Mengmeng","Ye, Xinyue",,,,,,,,,,,,4,CARTOGRAPHY AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SCIENCE,Spatiotemporal exposure index,flow network,hierarchical structure,spatiotemporal activity and trajectory data,residential segregation,SPATIAL INDEXES,ACTIVITY SPACES,HUMAN MOBILITY,RETHINKING,PATTERNS,TWITTER,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2 2021,An extended spatiotemporal exposure index for urban racial segregation

While advancements have been made in low-cost sensor deployments and satellite observations of atmospheric composition, integrating dynamic human mobility with wildfire PM 2.5 exposure to fully understand the environmental justice implications remains underinvestigated. This study aims to enhance the accuracy of estimating ground-level fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) concentrations by fusing chemical transport model outputs with empirical observations, estimating exposures using human mobility data, and evaluating the impact of environmental justice. Employing a novel data fusion technique, the study combines the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) outputs and surface PM 2.5 measurements, providing a more accurate estimation of PM 2.5 distribution. The study addresses the gap in traditional exposure assessments by incorporating human mobility data and further investigates the spatial correlation of PM 2.5 levels with various environmental and demographic factors from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping Tool (EJScreen). Results reveal that despite reduced mobility during high PM 2.5 levels from wildfire smoke, exposure for both residents and individuals on the move remains high. Regions already burdened with high environmental pollution levels face amplified PM 2.5 effects from wildfire smoke. Furthermore, we observed mixed correlations between PM 2.5 concentrations and various demographic and socioeconomic factors, indicating complex exposure patterns across communities. Urban areas, in particular, experience persistent high exposure, while significant correlations in rural areas with EJScreen factors highlight the unique vulnerabilities of these populations to smoke exposure. These results advocate for a comprehensive approach to environmental health that leverages advanced models, integrates human mobility data, and addresses socio-demographic disparities, contributing to the development of equitable strategies against the growing threat of wildfires.","Yu, Manzhu","Zhang, Shiyan","Ning, Huan","Li, Zhenlong","Zhang, Kai",,,,,,,,,,6,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,Canadian wildfire 2023,Wildfire smoke,Mobility-based exposure,Environmental justice,WILDLAND FIRE SMOKE,HEALTH IMPACTS,INDIVIDUAL EXPOSURE,PARTICULATE MATTER,POLLUTION,VULNERABILITY,MOBILITY,MODEL,,,,,,,,,,MAY 20 2024,"Assessing the 2023 Canadian wildfire smoke impact in Northeastern US: Air quality, exposure and environmental justice"

To assess the risk of outdoor dust in kindergartens, the antibiotic resistome and potential pathogens were investigated in dust samples collected from 59 kindergartens in Xiamen, southeast China in both the winter and summer. Both high-throughput quantitative PCR and metagenome analysis revealed a higher richness and abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in winter (P < 0.05). Besides, the bloom of ARGs and potential pathogens was evident in the urban kindergartens. The co-occurrence patterns among ARGs, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and potential pathogens suggested some bacterial pathogens were potential hosts of ARGs and MGEs. We found a large number of high-risk ARGs in the dust; the richness and abundance of high-risk ARGs were higher in winter and urban kindergartens compared to in summer and peri-urban kindergartens, respectively. The results of the co-occurrence patterns and high-risk ARGs jointly reveal that urbanization will significantly increase the threat of urban dust to human beings and their risks will be higher in winter.

This study mines 27,981 tourist-generated trajectories in Beijing winter tourism to reveal the spatiotemporal patterns and spatial structures using a framework combining similarity measures and improved density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm. The findings indicate that Beijing winter tourism has established a spatial structure consisting of ""three poles-two axes-two secondary poles."" A total of 50 popular routes and 12 patterns of winter tourism can be categorized into three main types and six subcategories: winter tourism leading (skiing oriented, skating oriented), winter tourism with sightseeing (urban snow scene sightseeing, mountain snow scene sightseeing), and winter tourism with leisure (skiing + hot spring therapy, skating + city walking). The findings demonstrate that identifying spatial structures through tourism pattern mining is scientific and feasible.

This paper introduces an innovative methodology for the identification and analysis of illegal parking hotspots. To achieve this, a custom Web-GIS platform is developed that employs crowdsourcing, enabling citizens to report the precise locations and types of parking violations they encounter. The platform collects this data, which is then analyzed using a Spatio-Temporal Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (ST-DBSCAN) algorithm. The methodology was applied in the city of Athens, Greece, with the findings revealing that parking violations are not uniformly distributed but instead show distinct spatial and temporal patterns. Specifically, certain areas and times during the day exhibit considerably higher levels of illegal parking. For instance, commercial areas tend to experience more violations during business hours, while residential areas see more issues during evenings and weekends, mainly due to an increasing number of already parked cars and a lack of organized parking spaces. By providing a data-driven approach to identifying critical areas of illegal parking, city officials can better allocate enforcement resources and develop targeted strategies to mitigate this issue, highlighting the significant implications of the study for urban management and policy-making. Therefore, the main goal of this research is to contribute to the enhancement of urban mobility and the overall quality of life by addressing one of the most persistent challenges in city management.","Delialis, Parmenion","Iliopoulou, Christina","Karountzos, Orfeas","Kepaptsoglou, Konstantinos",,,,,,,,,,,0,APPLIED SPATIAL ANALYSIS AND POLICY,Illegal parking,Spatio-temporal analysis,Spatial data analytics,Geographical Information Systems (GIS),Web-GIS,Crowdsourcing,ILLEGAL PARKING,URBAN,OPENSTREETMAP,ENVIRONMENTS,INFORMATION,CITIZENS,,,,,,,,,,MAR 2025,Where's the Ticket?

However, relatively little is known about the extents and causes of green space inequalities among different social communities. To explore this in the metropolitan Melbourne area, we use the 2016 Census data of equivalised household income and calculate local indicators of spatial association (LISA) between low-income proportion and green space access at a suburb level. We show that the distribution of green space in Melbourne favors more affluent communities, meaning that there are lower concentrations of low-income households in greener areas. The Mann-Whitney U statistics applied to LISA clusters also indicates statistically significant inequity in access to green space for low-income communities. Secondly, the paper shows that low-income households' relocation and provision of human-modified green space exacerbate inequality in green space access over time. Mobility patterns show the movement of low-income people from high-green areas to low-green areas over time. The spatial analysis of green space types reveals that the location of human-modified green spaces has a significant correlation with (non-randomly distributed) natural green spaces.","Sharifi, Farahnaz","Nygaard, Andi","Stone, Wendy M.","Levin, Iris",,,,,,,,,,,50,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,Green space,Equity,Quality of life,Population mobility,Melbourne,ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE,HOUSING AFFORDABILITY,RESIDENTIAL-MOBILITY,SPATIAL EQUITY,MENTAL-HEALTH,SOCIAL EQUITY,AMENITY VALUE,PARK ACCESS,URBAN,ACCESSIBILITY,,,,,,,MAR 2021,Accessing green space in Melbourne: Measuring inequity and household mobility

However, transportation is not the only factor that may impede food access. This study identifies factors that influence where a household chooses to shop by creating a location-choice model using real travel patterns of low-income households in Dallas. While this analysis shows that travel time to the store remains the most important factor, the results indicate that accessibility also depends on the (1) age of household members (e.g., the presence of seniors or children), (2) access to mobility options, (3) built environment and urban development, (4) household size, and (5) employment. A new metric of food accessibility is formulated, incorporating multiple contributors to inaccess and overcoming limitations of the USDA FD definition. The results show that the proposed metric adapts to any level of aggregation, identifies where targeted interventions could be implemented, and allows for the integration of real travel and shopping behaviors to better coordinate urban planning approaches that increase access to food in the urban environment.","Abel, Kelsey C.","Nair, Gopindra Sivakumar","Bhat, Chandra","Faust, Kasey M.",,,,,,,,,,,1,JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT,Food desert,Location-choice modeling,Accessibility,NHTS,Travel behaviors,INCOME,FORMULATION,DETROIT,ACCESS,TIME,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 1 2022,Breaking Out from Food Desert Boundaries: Using Travel Behavior and Location-Choice Modeling to Measure Food Accessibility

The development of efficient and scalable trajectory clustering algorithms, however, still faces challenges because of the computational costs when measuring similarities among a large number of network-constrained trajectories. To address this problem, a novel trajectory clustering framework based on the well-developed Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) approach is proposed. This proposed framework accurately quantifies similarities using a trajectory representation of continuous polylines in the space and time dimensions, and does not require trajectory discretization. Further, the proposed framework utilizes the space-time buffering concept to formulate e-neighborhood queries that directly retrieve the e-neighbors of trajectories and thus avoids computing a trajectory similarity matrix. State-of-the-art trajectory databases and index structures are incorporated to further improve trajectory clustering performance. A comprehensive case study was carried out using an open dataset of 20,161 trajectories. Results show that the proposed framework efficiently executed trajectory clustering on the large test dataset within 3 min.

There has been a paucity of knowledge, however, regarding the relationship between bike-sharing and public transit. In this article, we solicit one year of bike trip data comprising approximately 17 million trips from Citi Bike, the largest dock-based bike-sharing system in New York City. Then, we derive six bike usage clusters based on three clustering variables: the start trips, end trips, and station empty status. Finally, we propose three relationships between bike-sharing and public transit: competition, integration, and complementation. The result demonstrates that bike-sharing can largely compete with public transit in New York City. A significant portion of bike-sharing trips are more time-intensive than their public transit alternatives. The article concludes that this competition exists due to riders' preferences for lower costs and flexibility over savings in travel time, which helps to improve transportation equity for socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. Thus, in New York City, bike-sharing primarily fulfills the need for low-cost and flexible travel rather than solving ""the last mile problem.""

Although the most prevailing framework, the gravity model, has been applied in its various versions, there is little information available about how city industry structure functions as the invisible distance in the modeling of intercity population migration. Here, we introduce a family of improved gravity models by considering city industry structure proximity, complementarity, and diversities. The resulting models predict population migration patterns in good agreement with the flows observed. Our best model (GM_COM) outperforms the benchmark model (GM_O) by 24.6 percent in terms of mean absolute percentage error. Further analysis shows the improved models offer several advantages with respect to the base models. They have better prediction accuracies for flows with high intensities and long distances. The best model demonstrates obvious improvement when flows occur in eastern China.

Spatiotemporal patterns of child pedestrian crashes and their daily activity patterns were examined through a descriptive analysis of household travel records and hotspot analysis of crash incidences. Zero-inflated negative binomial models were further estimated to identify potential risk factors affecting child pedestrian crash incidents by time of day. The findings indicate a significant disparity in patterns and risk factors between child pedestrian crashes before and after school hours, possibly explained by the proximity to major travel destinations such as schools and Hagwons (i.e., private educational facilities). Although relevant policy efforts have primarily focused on nearby schools and home-toschool trips, this study provides evidence of potentially hazardous areas at times and locations other than schools.

However, there are few targeted and practical studies of GINs in high-density urban areas with a prominent contradiction between ecological construction and land scarcity, leading to insufficient feasibility of most optimization paths as they avoid practical contradictions (scarcity of land, high cost, etc.). As an effective way to economically increase green infrastructure, green roofs have been demonstrated to provide habitats and stepping stones to increase landscape connectivity for high-mobility organisms. However, few studies have applied green roofs to GIN optimization. To address this question, a new approach to optimize GINs was proposed from the perspective of integrating potential green roofs (PGRs). A complete and feasible workflow was also established to rapidly, accurately, and cost-effectively extract PGRs, scientifically evaluate the comprehensive landscape connectivity accounting for PGR isolation factors, and practically optimize GINs according to the spatial differentiation of PGRs with high landscape connectivity. This was done by integrating high-spatial-resolution remote sensing, machine learning, morphological spatial pattern analysis, landscape index method, and a minimum cumulative resistance model. A case study in a typical high-density urban area within the Beijing Fifth Ring Road, China demonstrated the applicability and implications of the workflow. The results clearly showed that the study area had a high potential for green roof retrofitting, PGRs with high landscape connectivity could effectively improve the GINs, and the spatial differentiation characteristics of the PGR network optimization benefits provided the scientific guidance for developing targeted ecological strategies.

Previous research suggests that multidimensional factors allow understanding the distribution of the disease but has limitations such as having nonhomogeneous units as the object of study, not incorporating changes in sanitary control measures over time or the absence of mobility variables. To overcome these shortcomings, we investigated the association between socioeconomic, demographic, and built environment factors with infection rates in the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona, one of the most compact and mixed-use environments in Europe. For this purpose, we use spatial regression models at five different stages that capture variations in sanitary control measures. Our results indicate that before the lockdown, infections were concentrated in high-income areas, but once it started the pattern shifted toward areas characterized by overcrowding, with more people who did not have the opportunity to telework, as well as nursing homes. Although commuting time also maintained a positive association with infections, the use of public transportation was not observed to have a direct impact. Contrary to what was speculated at the beginning of the pandemic, density was not shown to be a decisive factor in explaining infection rates; therefore, the results suggest keeping the focus on the quality of housing to avoid intrafamily infections but particularly in those where elderly dependents live. Likewise, public transportation can maintain its benefits for the most vulnerable urban populations as long as minimum safety measures are guaranteed in its interior.","Rojas-Quiroz, Jose","Marmolejo-Duarte, Carlos",,,,,,,,,,,,,2,JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT,COVID-19,Spatial regression,Barcelona,Built environment,Mobility,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 1 2022,"Determining Equality of Infection Rates: A Spatial Analysis of Factors Associated with the Spread of COVID-19 in Barcelona, Spain"

Furthermore, the network centrality of villages was estimated to reflect the intensity of urban-rural social mobility ties. The results indicated marked spatial disparities in rural vitality, and the coupling of ecological-cultural vitality has a high degree of coherence.

Row_221,"As an important task in spatial data mining, trajectory transportation mode recognition can reflect various individual behaviors and traveling patterns in urban space. As trajectory is essentially a sequence, many scholars use the sequence inference models to mine the information in trajectory data. However, such methods often ignored the spatial correlation between trajectory points and implemented the evaluation based only on representative feature statistics selected in the trajectory data preprocessing stage, thus have difficulties in acquiring high-order traveling pattern features. In this study, we propose a novel ensemble recognition method for representing trajectory data with the graph structure based on sequence and dependency relations. This method integrates the sequence of trajectory points and the correlation between characteristic points of a travel path into a fused graph convolutional network to obtain semantic feature information at multiple levels.

By integrating epidemiological models with georeferenced data and social indicators, we analyse how the virus propagates in a complex urban setting, characterized by significant social and economic disparities. The research highlights the role of various factors, including mobility patterns, neighbourhood configurations, and local inequalities, in the spatial spreading of COVID-19 throughout Sao Paulo. We simulate disease transmission across the city's 96 districts, offering insights into the impact of network topology and district-specific variables on the spread of infections. The study seeks to fine-tune the model to extract epidemiological parameters for further use in a statistical analysis of social variables. Our findings underline the critical importance of spatial analysis in public health strategies and emphasize the necessity for targeted interventions in vulnerable communities.

Yet, less attention has been paid to the current spatial patterns of interprovincial migration, especially the spatial heterogeneity of the determinants. Based on the newly released 2020 census data, this study explored the spatial patterns and determinants of interprovincial migration in China using a spatial analysis and geographically weighted regression. The results revealed multiple trends in interprovincial migration, including flow from developing provinces in the central region to eastern and western regions and returning flow from developed to developing provinces in the central and western regions. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, and Pearl River Delta urban agglomerations remained centres of population inflow. Moreover, key western development areas, such as the Chengdu-Chongqing area and Xinjiang, emerged as centres of population inflow. Economic and social development, social safety, and living environment significantly and positively affected interprovincial migration. Furthermore, significant spatial heterogeneity in factors influencing migration was detected.

In light of their practical benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, and traffic congestion mitigation, smart cities manage mobility services by tracking user demand and service utilization over time. Leveraging this data is crucial for discerning current patterns and anticipating future trends, thus improving service provision. In this context, we propose a new interactive dashboard for the advanced analysis of spatio-temporal data acquired from bike-sharing systems. Our goal is to show on an interactive map the city areas with the highest current and future users' demand and a simulation of the routes suitable for redistributing bikes across stations according to their predicted occupancy level. We leverage a clustering algorithm to identify the areas with currently highest bike demand and a forecasting approach to predict users' demand trends. Thanks to multi-resolution time and path management, end-users can exploit the dashboard to support their decisions regarding resource shaping.

With China's Rural Revitalization Strategy and the industrial transfer from the eastern coastal areas to the inland, the migration direction and pattern of the floating population have undergone certain changes. Using the 2017 China Migrants Dynamic Survey (CMDS), excluding Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan regions of China, organized by China's National Health Commission, the relationship matrix of the floating population is constructed according to the inflow place of the interviewees and their outflow place (the location of the registered residence) in the questionnaire survey. We then apply the complex network model to analyze the migration direction and network pattern of China's floating population from the city scale. The migration network shows an obvious hierarchical agglomeration. The first-, second-, third- and fourth-tier distribution cities are municipalities directly under the central government, provincial capital cities, major cities in the central and western regions and ordinary cities in all provinces, respectively. The migration trend is from the central and western regions to the eastern coastal areas. The migration network has 'small world' characteristics, forming nine communities. It shows that most node cities in the same community are closely linked and geographically close, indicating that the migration network of floating population is still affected by geographical proximity. Narrowing the urban-rural and regional differences will promote the rational distribution this population.

Row_226,"A location's irreplaceability refers to the degree of difficulty with which it can be replaced by other locations. For example, the irreplaceability of airports, hospitals, and ATMs varies, and that between hospitals is also different. They differ in both the number of users and the extent of service area. Quantifying the location's irreplaceability provides guidance for urban planning, such as siting of public resources. Existing methods for quantifying an urban location's irreplaceability do not consider human activity at the location, therefore the revealed irreplaceability may deviate from the resident's perceptions. To address this issue, we use origin-destination flows to reflect human activity. We propose a flow-based locational measure, I-index, to quantify the location's irreplaceability. It can be viewed as 'H-index of flow' where we regard locations as scientists, flows as papers. I-index of a location is the maximum value of i such that at least i flows with a length of at least alpha* i meters have reached this location, where a is the conversion factor that can be determined adaptively from the flow dataset. I-index elegantly combines the flow volume and length into a single value. The effectiveness of the I-index is validated by simulation experiments. Two case studies show that the hospital's irreplaceability strongly correlates with the hospital bypass behavior and locations with strongly mixed urban functions are more irreplaceable. The implications for urban planning are further discussed.","Wang, Xi","Chen, Jie","Pei, Tao","Song, Ci","Liu, Yaxi","Shu, Hua","Guo, Sihui","Chen, Xiao",,,,,,,15,COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS,Locational measure,Irreplaceability,Origin-destination flow,Flow mapping,H-index,LAND-USE,FLOWS,TRANSPORT,PATTERNS,ACCESSIBILITY,DYNAMICS,MOBILITY,DISTANCE,CHOICE,,,,,,,,NOV 2021,I-index for quantifying an urban location's irreplaceability
Row_227,"Shared micro-mobility has been booming in recent years and the coordinated development of different modes can play an important role in improving the connectivity of the urban public transport system. While most previous studies have analysed the feeder trips of individual modes, few comparative studies of different modes have been conducted. To this end, we compared the spatial and temporal patterns in the integrated use of station -based bikeshare systems (SBBS) and free-floating bikeshare systems (FFBS) with the metro. This study used the smart card data of SBBS and transaction data of FFBS from 1st to 30th September 2017, in Nanjing, China. Generalised additive mixed models were applied to examine the nuanced effects of the built environment, weather factors and temporal variables, while taking into account spatio-temporal autocorrelations. The results show that SBBS are used more as a feeder mode at downtown metro stations and exhibit pronounced rush hour patterns. FFBS-metro integrated use is spatially more dispersed at peripheral stations and covers wider periods of the day. This suggests that SBBS use is more demand-driven, while FFBS use is more efficiency-driven. The built environment shows different forms of effects: variables that have a linear relationship with SBBS-metro inte-grated use show non-linear effects in the FFBS model, and vice versa. Certain variables also present variations in their non-linear patterns. For instance, the plateau effect of road density for SBBS occurs at 10.5 km/km2, while the optimal employment density for FFBS is 12,000 jobs/km2. Inadequate or excessive development can lead to a decrease in integration efficiency. These findings can inform how service providers optimise fleet reallocation and how transport planners tailor spatial interventions that promote the integration of bikeshare and the metro system.","Cheng, Long","Huang, Jie","Jin, Tanhua","Chen, Wendong","Li, Aoyong","Witlox, Frank",,,,,,,,,36,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Shared micro-mobility,Bikeshare,Built environment,Non-linear effects,Generalised additive mixed models,Multimodal transport,BIKE-SHARING SYSTEMS,BUILT ENVIRONMENT,SCOOTER-SHARE,USAGE,DETERMINANTS,TRANSIT,BICYCLE,WASHINGTON,PATTERNS,IMPACTS,,,,,,FEB 2023,Comparison of station-based and free-floating bikeshare systems as feeder modes to the metro

This paper studies the temporal and spatial features of jobshousing relationship and their relations with regional mobility and regional structure in 2258 Quxians (urban districts or rural counties) across China based on 49 months of cellular signaling data. Results show that jobshousing relationship differ between city types and have seasonal cycles and yearly trends reflecting the rhythm and development of human activity. The temporal variations in jobs-housing relationship are affected by regional mobility, and larger intercity travel volume leads to lower balance level. The spatial variations in jobshousing relationship are influenced by the form of regional structure, as measured using the Zipf scaling exponent. More polarized regions are less balanced with exceptions in underdeveloped regions. There is an underlying inflection point in jobs-housing relationship that is similar to its long-term average value and reflects regional market equilibrium.

However, comprehensive studies on emission patterns and decarbonization strategies in these metropolitan areas remain limited. This study presents a novel and portable big data-based workflow for megacities to reveal their spatiotemporal dynamics of road CO2 emissions and quantify decarbonization potentials associated with inter-city travel and the 15-minute city concept. We take Guangzhou City (China) as a case study. Our results reveal that primary purpose trips produce 17 % more CO2 emissions than secondary trips on average. Inter-city trips account for 36.3 % of the total emissions in the city, and those for primary purposes exhibit closer spatial distributions with intra-city trips. While providing more 15-minute-walk POIs exhibits a marginally diminishing effect on reducing trip average emissions, comprehensive implementation of the 15-minute city concept in Guangzhou can reduce up to 56.3 % of the total emissions from non-home-related passenger trips, with variations observed across different trip purposes (40 %-70 %).

Current studies focus on parking in inner city areas, giving less attention to issues in outer city areas that have different neighbourhood features. This study examines the differences in parking problems between inner and outer city spaces and reveals the nexus between built environment features and the prevalence of parking problems. We utilised a large-scale administrative dataset of civil complaints from Brisbane City Council, Australia and retrieved 162,986 parking-related complaints in 2014-2017 to account for parking problems. We examined its spatiotemporal patterns across the inner, middle and outer city rings, and how these patterns vary by problem types and calendar events, and associate with the built environment features. Our results show that parking problems are more concentrated in the inner city ring, with only some sporadically distributed local clustering in the outer city areas. On holidays and weekends, parking problems are relatively more obvious in the outer city than the inner and middle city rings. Furthermore, more problems are reported in areas where land uses are less mixed, land parcels are smaller, and on vacant land or areas with larger green space coverage, especially in industrial areas or areas near transport hubs and junctions. Our findings provide evidence for the need to consider parking policies beyond inner city conditions and to implement more sustainability-oriented initiatives on transport, mobility and liveability across all urban spaces.","Wang, Siqin","Liu, Yan",,,,,,,,,,,,,6,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Parking problems,Parking complaints,Inner and outer city rings,Built environment,Large- scale administrative data,Australia,NEIGHBOR COMPLAINTS,TRAVEL,OWNERSHIP,POLICIES,CHOICE,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2022,"Parking in inner versus outer city spaces: Spatiotemporal patterns of parking problems and their associations with built environment features in Brisbane, Australia"

Row_232,"The rapid growth of dockless bike-sharing services (DBSs) in recent years has provided a new potential technological solution to the critical last mile problem of urban mobility and is thus considered a complement to public transit. However, there is little causal evidence of such technology-enhanced DBSs complementing public transit. To address this research gap, this paper empirically investigates the complementary effect of DBSs on public transit using a quasi-natural experiment on the opening of Subway Line 3 in Xiamen, China. Our difference-in-differences estimation results show that the number of DBS trips near newly opened stations increased by 84.7 % on average after the subway opening, representing 40.4 % of all bike-sharing trips within the 100-m buffer zone of the subway station entrance. The results of the spatiotemporal heterogeneity analysis revealed that such complementary effects were concentrated within 2 km of rail transit stations, especially during peak commuting hours and in areas with low bus accessibility and high population density. Moreover, the number of street intersections negatively affected the complementary effect of DBS on the subway when the connection distance was short (i.e., less than 800 m). These findings can inform city governments on the effective use of DBSs to solve the critical last mile problem of public transit and to improve urban mobility, while also illuminating how service providers can optimize capacity allocation and vehicle rebalancing decisions.","Huang, Ganxiang","Wang, Hongyan","Xu, Di",,,,,,,,,,,,0,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Bike-sharing,Shared micromobility,Public transit,Last mile problem,Complement,Difference-in-differences,IMPACTS,PATTERNS,DEMAND,SYSTEM,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,"Understanding the complementary effect of bike-sharing on public transit: A case study of subway line expansion in Xiamen, China"
Row_233,"This paper offers a critical perspective on spatial supply structures of new mobility services using the example of carsharing, bikesharing and e-scootersharing. Following conceptual consideration of Splintering Urbanism, the emergence of a Premium Mobility Network Space (PMNS) is propounded; i.e. an exclusive supply of interconnected mobility services that is inscribed in the social and action spaces of the economically and culturally privileged elites of Western (post-industrial) societies by the marked-based mobility providers. Regarding this, we assume that the PMNS is effective intra- and interregionally at different spatial scales because the social and action spaces of the post-industrial elites are correspondingly organized intra- and inter-regionally. A (preliminary) comparative study of German cities over 300,000 inhabitants in this paper suggests that this PMNS mainly extends across the economic and cultural prosperous context of Global Cities. In this city network, the same few market players of Carsharing, Bikesharing, E-Scootersharing, etc. can be located over and over again; i. e. travelers between the cities experience a reduced transaction effort because they do not have to install new apps to use the certain services and find the same services in every global city. By contrast, the supply of new mobility services in other cities that are not part of the global city network - and this applies in particular to the economically weak old industrial cities affected by structural change - is poor to non-existent. In a second step, bivariate and multivariate analyses using Frankfurt/Main as a case study reveal that the socio-spatially exclusive supply of new mobility services continues in the economically and culturally prosperous areas within the global cities themselves. Methodically, the city comparison is based on an Internet and media analysis in order to identify the supply of new mobility services by cities. For the analyses in Frankfurt, certain supply structures were overlaid with official city district data. Overall, our findings point to a spatially selective supply pattern of new mobility services within economically and culturally prosperous spaces, suggesting an interconnected mobility network in the sense of a PMNS. By contrast, urban peripheries beyond the global city are bypassed, i.e., on the one hand, the social spaces of the marginalized underclass in the socio-spatial peripheries and, on the other hand, the dispersed suburban housing estates associated with a traditional middle class that remain oriented toward private automobility. In conclusion, these observations are of great importance because they contradict any sustainability ascriptions that are discursively produced around the supply of new mobility services. The suspicion arises that developing new mobility services under market-based developments only permits socio-spatially fragmented supply structures, but not the expected spatially ubiquitous solution that is needed for sustainable everyday mobilities.","Groth, Soren","Klinger, Thomas","Otsuka, Noriko",,,,,,,,,,,,4,GEOFORUM,New Mobility Services,Sharing Mobility,Splintering Urbanism,Global City Network,Post -Industrialism,Sustainability,PLACING SPLINTERING URBANISM,GLOBAL CITY,TRANSPORT POVERTY,GENTRIFICATION,BICYCLE,TRAVEL,MULTIMODALITY,IMPACTS,ECONOMY,AREAS,,,,,,AUG 2023,Geographies of new mobility services: The emergence of a premium mobility network space

Over the past 20 years, home price inflation and affordable housing shrinkage have been particularly acute in Paris. Such issues have been linked to the displacement of lower-income Parisians and the suburbanisation of poverty on a regional scale. In this article, we match disaggregated data from the Family Benefits Fund (CAF) with information on local housing markets, to empirically document these expulsionary processes. Our methodology is twofold. First, we investigate out-migration factors using logistic regressions. Second, we compare households' changes in access to the city centre and urban resources following a move. Data show that social vulnerability is associated with a greater risk of leaving Paris and that housing welfare is playing a crucial role in mitigating this risk. Also, the higher the pressure on local housing markets, the more social inequalities determine mobility behaviour. Finally, beyond the effects of family structure, patterns of decentralisation are related to income level: less affluent households go farther from the city centre, job opportunities and services than higher-income households.","Guibard, Luc","Le Goix, Renaud",,,,,,,,,,,,,0,URBAN STUDIES,decentralisation,displacement,exclusion,gentrification,housing,out-migration,poverty,RESIDENTIAL-MOBILITY,POVERTY,LONDON,SUBURBANIZATION,SEGREGATION,,,,,,,,,,AUG 2024,Those who leave: Out-migration and decentralisation of welfare beneficiaries in gentrified Paris

Row_238,"This article evaluates the effect of depopulation, as a common trend in European countries and post-industrial cities, on the selected components of urban spatial structure, as an example of L ' odz ' (Poland). An integrated land use and transportation model was adapted and calibrated based on the available data in the study area and modeled the evolution of the city structure from 2020 to 2040. For the land use part, the spatial input-output concept and economic base theory are combined to compute the number of activities in the study area. First, the economic sectors (i.e., land, population, base, and service classes) are defined. Second, the production and consumption of each sector in L ' odz ' is calculated. Third, productions and consumptions are allocated to spatial units for determining the level of activities and flow between them. This process, which was programmed in Python, iterates until it reaches equilibrium in the activity system. For the transportation part, the PTV Visum simulator does the tasks of network representation and traffic assignment. Following the existing literature, changes in the distribution of employment, population, and land consumption within the activity system, along with trip length, trip production, and traffic loading in the mobility system, are regarded as urban structure factors and used for assessing the integrated model outputs. Getis-Ord and Theil's indices are also calculated to obtain the auxiliary results. Decentralization and dispersion in the spatial distribution of activities were iden-tified as the chief characteristics of the city form. As the population reduces in L ' odz ', the average land con-sumption and service activities per spatial analysis units drop in the simulation period, which lies in the correlation between population decline and the economic fall. In addition, depopulation leads to flattened spatial structure and lesser development intensity due to the scattered and de-intensified pattern of land consumption. Besides, the population shrinkage causes a decrease in inequality level by 60% and 25% from 2020 to 2030 and 2030 to 2040, respectively, which might root in the reduced and lower difference between population and service simultaneously. Moreover, computations showed that while the number of trips decreases, the trip length increases, which means after depopulation, people travel less between spatial units to fulfill their needs because the city shifts to the borderlines. Findings also assist decision-and policy-makers in recognizing the effect of population loss on L ' odz ''s spatial structure and offer implications of integrated models for addressing such phenomena.","Sahebgharani, Alireza","Wisniewski, Szymon","Borowska-Stefanska, Marta","Kowalski, Michal","Mokoei, Khashayar",,,,,,,,,,4,HABITAT INTERNATIONAL,Depopulation,Urban spatial structure,Integrated spatial model,Land use modeling,Activity -mobility pattern,URBAN-POPULATION,UNITED-STATES,SHRINKING CITIES,EUROPE,GROWTH,PERSPECTIVE,DECLINE,TRANSFORMATION,REGENERATION,,,,,,,,JAN 2024,"Analyzing the effect of depopulation on the spatial structure of the city of Lodz, Poland: Development and application of an integrated land use and transportation model"

Using 2017 data from the China Migrants Dynamic Survey, this paper adopts trend surface, standard deviation ellipse, and spatial correlation methods to describe the spatial pattern of migrant workers' income in China. It then employs econometric models to examine the spatial effects and determinants of migrant workers' income. The spatial pattern demonstrates an obvious cluster phenomenon for the migrant workers' income in prefectural cities. Based on this social context, our empirical results further show that migrant workers' income has a spatial dependence effect. Migrant workers' income is positively affected by the migrant workers' individual characteristics (demographics, outflow characteristics, social integration) and negatively affected by the external factors (public social services, economic development environment) of the cities into which they flow. There is salient spatial variation in the determinants of migrant workers' income in prefectural cities, which are divided into multifactorial influence zones, work experience and house price influence zones, and education and family influence zones by cluster analysis, and into eastern and midwestern influence zones according to China's three economic areas.","Wu, Haijiang","Wu, Qichao",,,,,,,,,,,,,0,GROWTH AND CHANGE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2021,The geography of migrant workers' income in China: Evidence from a migrants dynamic survey in 2017

To provide theoretical guidance for transport managers, it is imperative to deepen knowledge of the differences between the integration of DBS and ridesourcing with metros. A three-level structure was developed in this study to identify integrated DBS and ridesourcing trips using observed data from DiDi and Mobike in Shanghai, China. The travel characteristics of two identified integrated shared mobility modes were then compared. Finally, negative binomial regression models were built to investigate the factors influencing these two integrated uses. Comparative analysis shows that the travel distance intervals with the highest proportions are 0.5-1.0 km for DBS and 1.0-1.5 km for ridesourcing. In terms of temporal distribution, morning peaks of integrated DBS trips are higher and earlier than those of ridesourcing.

Row_242,"Cities - and, in general, urban agglomerations - have in recent years become foci of social science research and policy interest. Prominent attention has been given to agglomeration advantages, mobility patterns, urban decay, inequity problems, residents' quality of life, safety and crime, labour and housing markets, public amenities, and urban planning issues. Less attention however, has been paid to the basic question: what makes the city a 'real' and attractive city? This question prompts essentially a research challenge on the 'raison d'etre' of cities, in particular on the residential satisfaction and quality-of-life motives of urban inhabitants. The present paper aims to pinpoint attractiveness characteristics of cities based on perceptions of urban quality by residents and their affinity with city life. This paper offers a micro-based (individual) assessment of motives and appreciations of citizens, in terms of their love for the city. A typological distinction will be made between the 'soul' of the city (its spirit, history, cultural identity, ambiance, social capital, etc.) and the 'body' of the city (its built environment, infrastructure, public amenities, supply of housing, green areas, etc.). The empirical analysis - applied to the four largest cities in Sweden (Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmoe and Umea) - will be undertaken in two steps: (i) an exploratory statistical analysis of the findings from an extensive micro-based survey questionnaire among inhabitants in these four urban agglomerations; (ii) an explanatory evaluation of the individual appreciation scores using a regression approach. Our results show that the 'City Love Index' is a useful construct that can be decomposed into 'soul' and 'body' aspects of the city. Our multivariate regression analysis demonstrates clearly that both factors matter. More detailed results suggest that it is the perceptions regarding the city's 'walkability' and 'vibrancy', both part of the 'soul' of the city, that have a significant influence on the City Love Index -for all cities studied.","Kourtit, Karima","Nijkamp, Peter","Wahlstrom, Marie Harsman",,,,,,,,,,,,40,LAND USE POLICY,Quality of life,Attractiveness,Appreciation,'body' and 'soul',City love,'New Urban World',QUALITY-OF-LIFE,PLACE ATTACHMENT,SATISFACTION,HAPPINESS,HEALTH,CITY,ENVIRONMENT,CHALLENGES,MIGRATION,FRAMEWORK,,,,,,DEC 2021,How to make cities the home of people - a 'soul and body' analysis of urban attractiveness
Row_243,"Exposure to urban greenspaces such as parks, forests, and gardens can support psychological restoration. However, restorative environments research currently lacks theory and empirical evidence on gendered restorative processes. Literature on epidemiology has studied gender differences in greenspaces and mental health outcomes but results are unclear so far. In parallel, social psychology of gender and feminist urbanism suggest that gender-related socio-cultural norms, attitudes, and behaviours; roles and relations; stereotypes, expressions; identity and sexual orientation, as well as certain sex-related factors, can have profound influences on women's (and gender minorities') experiences in public space. Drawing from these disciplines, we address this key knowledge gap of restorative environments research by reviewing the role of gender and sex in psychological restoration and wider psychological experiences in urban greenspaces. The findings reveal that gender-related and certain sex-related factors can affect aspects of person-greenspaces interactions, including when greenspaces are accessed and where; why they are visited and with whom; and how greenspaces are experienced. Several potential barriers to women's and gender minorities' experiences in urban greenspaces are identified. These relate to visit characteristics (transport accessibility and mobility patterns, frequency, time, social context and purpose of visits), experiences of contextual features (perceived and objective safety, the quality and maintenance of urban greenspace, infrastructure features), and several top-down person and group-based experiences (personal meanings, majority dynamics and group belonging, intersecting sociodemographic and personal characteristics). Overall, the person-environment fit in urban greenspaces might be lower for women and gender minorities than for men. This might translate into lower perceptions of compatibility and being away and, simultaneously, higher attentional demands. Overall, this might reduce the restorative and psychological benefits of urban greenspaces for women and gender minorities. Future research is encouraged to assess empirically the effects of the identified gender- and sex-related factors in restorative experiences of urban greenspaces, as well as to explore restorative experiences among specific socio-demographic groups in which gender intersects with other personal and social features.","Bornioli, Anna","Hopkins-Doyle, Aife","Fasoli, Fabio","Faccenda, Giulio","Subiza-Perez, Mikel","Ratcliffe, Eleanor","Beyazit, Eda",,,,,,,,0,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,Sex and the city park: The role of gender and sex in psychological restoration in urban greenspaces

They offer a digital representation of the physical urban environment, which supports various city applications such as monitoring mobility, air quality, and modelling simulations. To accurately represent the physical world, UDTs need to be updated continuously to reflect the changes in the urban environment on time. The Internet of Things (IoT) enables real-time data collection to capture these changes. Combined with 3D city models, IoT allows the interactive visualisation of patterns and trends in UDTs. In this study, we conduct investigations on the requirements for the web visualisation of semantic 3D city models enriched with time-dependent properties from IoT and simulation data.

However, concrete evidence from a national-level analysis based on first-hand survey data is scarce. This paper explores the role of small towns in servicing their rural hinterlands, using nationwide survey data in 31 provinces throughout China. The role of small towns is measured by the mobility patterns of villager in using small-town services, namely, travel purposes and frequency. The results show that small towns are the main destination for access to daily necessities, agri-cultural trades, non-farm employment, basic education and minor medical treatment for rural villagers. They are universally important in providing agricultural products and daily goods, especially in less developed areas in middle and western parts of China. In developed areas, the role of small towns for non-farm work, schooling, eating out and leisure activities tends to increase. The diverse role of small towns depends mainly on socio-economic development, urban proximity and public transport infrastructure. High-frequency village-town bus services, diverse land use and a high-quality public service also affect the role of small towns.

Row_246,"Cities are very complex systems. Representing urban regions are essential for exploring, understanding, and predicting properties and features of cities. The enrichment of multi-modal urban big data has provided opportunities for researchers to enhance urban region embedding. However, existing works failed to develop an integrated pipeline that fully utilizes effective and informative data sources within geographic units. In this article, we regard a geo-tile as a geographic unit and propose a multi-modal and multi-stage representation learning framework, namely Geo-Tile2Vec, for urban analytics, especially for urban region properties identification. Specifically, in the early stage, geo-tile embeddings are firstly inferred through dynamic mobility events which are combinations of point-of-interest (POI) data and trajectory data by a Word2Vec-like model and metric learning. Then, in the latter stage, we use static street-level imagery to further enrich the embedding information by metric learning. Lastly, the framework learns distributed geo-tile embeddings for the given multi-modal data. We conduct experiments on real-world urban datasets. Four downstream tasks, i.e., main POI category classification task, main land use category classification task, restaurant average price regression task, and firm number regression task, are adopted for validating the effectiveness of the proposed framework in representing geo-tiles. Our proposed framework can significantly improve the performances of all downstream tasks. In addition, we also demonstrate that geo-tiles with similar urban region properties are geometrically closer in the vector space.","Luo, Y.","Leong, C.-T.","Jiao, S.","Chung, F.-L.","Li, W.","Liu, G.",,,,,,,,,0,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,30 June 2023,Geo-Tile2Vec: A Multi-Modal and Multi-Stage Embedding Framework for Urban Analytics

These zones exhibit dynamic changes over time, influenced by varying crowd dynamics and purposes [1] . To address this, we've introduced a novel approach extracting region function representations through compressed trajectory embedding (CTE). The CTE model extracts representations of urban functional zones from crowd trajectories, effectively compressing region features. Figure 1 provides an overview of our region representation through compressed trajectory embedding method. We firstly create two networks based on the functional RotatE [2] : a General POI network and zone networks, based on POIs and region-traveling trajectories. The General POI network captures global POI distribution to generate a general function representation for each category. Region networks focus on static and dynamic function representations of region, considering temporal aspects. Then we compare them with general POI function representations to analyze the effects between compressed trajectory embeddings and region functions.

The origin-entropy for a given zone accounts for all the trips that originate from this zone and calculates the level of geographical distribution diversity of these trips destinations. Likewise, the destination-entropy for a given zone considers all the trips that end in this zone and calculates the level of geographical distribution diversity of these trips origins. Furthermore, we created a CyberGIS application to visualize the measurements of origin- and destination-entropy, which allow researchers to examine and compare travel patterns to identify their spatial and temporal changes. Results show that the entropy-based measurements can capture the shifts in the geographical distribution diversity of trips origins and destinations, reflecting changes in people travel decision corresponding to major events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, several factors lead to the emergence of fragile and disintegrated systems, where several subsystems work under different schemes of formality. In this context, transit travel tends to be highly multimodal, which at the trip level has been scarcely studied. In this study, the metropolitan geography of the primary forms of Transit Mode Combinations (TMCs) is explored for the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) based on data from the 2017 Household Origin -Destination Survey (HODS17). Transit travel is disaggregated to analyze its multimodality, its link with location, as well as its sociodemographic profiles. The most frequent TMCs are compared regarding average travel distances and speed, and their ridership rates are mapped. A regression model is used to test the socioeconomic and urban form correlates of the TMCs. The results show that transit multimodality has a specific geographical pattern by TMCs. Most Metro users are not those residing close to its stations but those having these stations at their trip destination. Travel by Metro shows a stronger association with decreasing Colectivo ridership than with travel by Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). These findings are discussed based on issues of equity and the emerging debates about the path that transit systems must follow in the developing world.","Bautista-Hernandez, Dorian Antonio","Nieto, Alejandra Trejo",,,,,,,,,,,,,0,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Transit,Commute,Multimodality,Intermodality,Built environment,Mexico City,MODE CHOICE,BUILT ENVIRONMENT,URBAN TRANSPORT,SELF-SELECTION,CAR USE,TRAVEL,ATTITUDES,IMPACTS,,,,,,,,MAY 2024,"Who uses transit in the journey to work?

After classifying the longitudinal patterns of HAS between 2011 and 2020, we examine under which preconditions between 2007 and 2010 households were likely to experience chronic forms of HAS. The results reveal that certain combinations of household income, housing tenure choice, and location of residence significantly heighten the probability of experiencing chronic forms of HAS.

The aim of this study is to develop a mobility-based framework to determine geographical units for assessing bilateral jobs-housing balance, i.e., work-based self-containment (WSC) and home-based selfcontainment (HSC). The commuting connection intensity index is proposed based on the Gravity model to reflect the actual commuting relationship among regions using the cell phone signaling data of China Unicom in September 2021. The community detection algorithm is then applied to determine geographic units for the assessment. Evidence from Beijing shows an inconsistency between WSC and HSC in the 39 identified geographic units that are not subjected to administrative boundaries. In addition, lower WSC and HSC values in Beijing indicate a mismatch between jobs and housing throughout the city, particularly in the urban center.

Unlike previous studies in which the effects on public spaces are related to a reduced number of private vehicles, in this paper we present a method to analyse the spatial variation in parking demand in a city with the joint consideration of the kind of parking actually in use. A distinction is made between dedicated parking areas from on-street parking.A trip-level analysis approach is then followed, where car ownership is an exogenous variable and modelling scenarios on modal diversion patterns for different origin-destination pairs are examined. Travel demand models are calibrated and validated on a stated-preferences travel survey carried out in Turin in 2016 and applied on a revealed-preferences travel survey distributed in the cities of Milan and Turin (Italy) in May 2019. Both surveys were administered to a representative sample of the population living in the cities, therefore results can be generalised.The ideal scenario resulting from modal diversion patterns show that free-floating car sharing might produce positive and negative impacts on both on-street and on-surface dedicated parking areas. In particular, more positive impacts are expected on daily parking events in central areas, where mobility attractors are concen-trated. On the contrary, higher negative impacts on both on-street and dedicated parking events might be encountered in more peripheral areas.","Diana, Marco","Chicco, Andrea",,,,,,,,,,,,,3,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Car sharing,Parking policy,Sustainability,Multimodality,VEHICLE OWNERSHIP,IMPACT,MOBILITY,GROWTH,USAGE,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2022,The spatial reconfiguration of parking demand due to car sharing diffusion: a simulated scenario for the cities of Milan and Turin (Italy)
Row_254,"Digital footprints collected from social media platforms are often clustered using methods such as the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and its variants to identify daily travel activities (e.g., dwelling, working, entertainment, and eating). However, these clustering methods mostly only consider the spatial distribution of travel activity points while ignoring their geographic context, resulting in the aggregation of digital footprints representing different activity types into one cluster. In addition, existing works only focus on examining people's travel activities at either the collective (i.e., macro) or individual (i.e., micro) level. To this end, this study utilizes geographic context information and develops a novel activity knowledge discovery framework to better detect frequent travel activities at both levels. First, we develop a multi-level spatial clustering method to aggregate digital footprints of a group of users into collective clusters (i.e., activity zones) by inferring and integrating the underlying activities performed at each zone with OpenStreetMap (OSM) datasets that can inform geographic context of the activity zones. Next, we introduce a location-aware clustering method to detect activity zones and associate activity types at the individual level by aggregating individual footprints based on the collective results. As case studies, digital footprints from 49 selected Twitter users are analyzed to evaluate the proposed framework. The results reveal that: (1) The multi-level spatial clustering method can often detect significant collective activity zones; and (2) The location-aware clustering method can aggregate individual digital footprints into activity zones more effectively compared with existing density-based spatial clustering methods (e.g., DBSCAN).","Liu, Xinyi","Huang, Qunying","Gao, Song","Xia, Jizhe",,,,,,,,,,,16,COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS,Activity space,Movement patterns,Human mobility,Spatial clustering,Multi-level clustering,Urban study,Trajectory knowledge discovery,HUMAN MOBILITY PATTERNS,SCAN STATISTICS,UNCERTAINTY,TWITTER,MEDIA,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2021,Activity knowledge discovery: Detecting collective and individual activities with digital footprints and open source geographic data

Though previous studies indicated that bike-sharing is associated with various social, environmental, and economic benefits, unintended adverse outcomes of DBS that constitute public nuisance also have been reported. Thus, it is necessary to assess the DBS effects on urban transport sustainability for strategic decisions on its further developments. This study is focused on the evaluation of environment-, public- and individual user-interest related effects of DBS, in terms of efficient resource utilization by sharing, Green House Gas (GHG) emission reduction, urban transport efficiency enhancement, public space occupation and individual cost-savings. The assessment models of DBS's resource demand and GHG emission, user transport time and cost, road and roadside parking space demand allocated in the functional unit of transporting one passenger for one kilometre are developed. Economic value models of the reduced resources demand, GHG emissions, transport time, and the occupied public space are then proposed for scaling DBS's overall benefits. A scenario model is developed to describe the DBS scheme and the benefits analysis's social-economic backgrounds. The case study of Shanghai, the largest DBS market nationwide, is presented to enrich the knowledge about DBS schemes in China, their potential contribution to urban transport sustainability, and implications for public administration, operation management and user behaviour guidance. The proposed assessment models can be applied to studies on DBS schemes in other China contexts to provide some comparisons and a more comprehensive understanding of its effects.

This study aims to use multidimensional connectivity network analysis to answer the role of landscape resources as a connecting medium (represented by linear canals) penetrating the urban-rural space in urban-rural integration. First, this study proposes a framework of ""Urban-Canal-Rural"" from a multidimensional perspective. In this research, we re-examined the urban-rural differences within the region by using the canal as the central regional conduit connecting urban and rural areas. Then, an association network based on five dimensions was constructed, and the network's connectivity was detected. In light of this, the integration characteristics and factor flow mechanism of ""Urban-Canal-Rural"" were revealed. Based on the study, we identified the potential interactive advantages of urban-rural integration within the canal basin, which provides the strategy for the development of ""Urban-Canal-Rural"" integration. The study found that within the same region, ""Urban-Canal-Rural"" shows completely different correlation strengths in five dimensions, revealing that the urban-rural differences in the process of urbanization are closely related to the inadequate utilization of resources. It also confirmed the importance of multidimensional network construction in balancing the allocation of resources between urban and rural areas in the process of urban-rural integration. Finally, the relations of factor mobility and resource allocation to sustainable urban and rural development were discussed. The authors argued that core resources between rural and urban areas are the key variable in restructuring rural-urban relations to achieve sustainable development. In general, urban and rural development should maintain the integrity and balance of the regional system. Additionally, this study provides Chinese experience for the worldwide study of urban-rural sustainable development.How to scrutinize the new interaction and balance between urban and rural areas is an unavoidable topic for urban and rural development. Examining the issue of urban-rural differences in the process of urbanization from a dynamic and systematic perspective, we found a close relationship between the balance and utilization of regional resources and regional differences.

Network analysis was used to grasp the whole picture of the urban-rural spatial structure and reveal the overall characteristics of the network structure to determine the optimal network connectivity and resource allocation. This method can be used to facilitate the optimization of interregional connectivity and resource allocation approaches, as well as the formulation and communication of consensus-building processes for planning and sustainable development management.

While scholars have shown great enthusiasm for studying location irreplaceability, accurately measuring it and understanding the effects of urban form have not been thoroughly explored through empirical research. This study selects Shenzhen, China, as the study area. First, the I-index, which focuses on geographic flow, is utilized to measure the location's irreplaceability using mobile phone data.

The study demonstrates that the I-index, considering flow volume and distance, can effectively measure the location's irreplaceability. The results of GTWR indicate that the location's irreplaceability and its influencing factors exhibit spatiotemporal heterogeneity.

Row_258,"Cities around the world are moving away from the car-centric infrastructure, urban design and planning policies prevalent since the 1950s and promoting sustainable mobility as an alternative, including cycling. As such, Bicycle Sharing Systems (BSS) have emerged as a transport innovation across the globe. Cycling modal share however remains low in most Southern European island cities. These cities exhibit certain characteristics considered as barriers to cycling, such as hot summers and high humidity, hilliness, and car-oriented culture and infrastructure. Despite this, BSS and policies promoting cycling have emerged in this region as well. These have the potential to provide alternatives for those marginalized by car-based mobility and to reduce traffic related diseases and injuries, noise and air pollution, which can contribute to an improved quality of life for all citizens. Using the Mediterranean island city of Limassol (Cyprus) as a case study, the utilization of bicycle sharing is investigated by constructing regression models to assess the influence of spatial and temporal factors on the demand for BSS use at stations. From the regression models it appears that land use factors such as residential, commercial and park land use, as well as the presence of the beach and cycling paths positively influences frequency of use, as does higher network connectivity. While higher tourist arrivals have a positive effect, the presence of hotels in a 300 m buffer around the stations does not. Higher rainfall, as well as higher temperatures, are associated with a decrease in BSS use. Explicitly incorporating spatial dependence, in Spatial Auto-Regressive (SAR) models, led to the formulation of models with comparable or better explanatory power, when compared to the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) models.

In Sri Lanka, urban cities like Colombo with high population densities are challenged to control the spread of the virus due to the unprecedented clustering of people in public parks. However, allowing access to such spaces is a vital requirement to ensure the health and wellbeing of the neighborhood. Since the gatherings and crowding in open parks are inevitable, the risk of being infected is irrepressible. Thus, it is of paramount importance to study the physical distribution of parks and playgrounds in dense neighborhoods of the Colombo metro area to evaluate their user attraction and risk index, in order to reinvent strategies to ease the pandemic outbreak. This study investigates five main variables: neighborhood density (ND), park values (PV), user mobility (UM), park capacity (PC) and park extent (PE) of 34 public parks and playgrounds located within the Colombo metro area. Each variable was visualized using Geographical Information System and space syntax and further correlated using SPSS software. PVs are designed to numerically interpret user attraction towards selected settings. From the relationship between each variable with park values, it was identified that large-scale parks with multifunctional facilities attract more users than small pockets of neighborhood playgrounds. Thus, study findings strongly suggest that parks and playgrounds should be distributed in more isolated pockets to absorb the threshold of park users within a neighborhood bubble, while discouraging visitors from outside the bubble. Through fragmenting the large scale municipal and district parks and facilitating the local parks of less than 0.05 square kilometers, the attraction of users can be controlled. Overall, moderation of facilities can reduce 41% of the total attraction to parks. The even distribution of facilities encourages more utilization of neighborhood, community, and pocket parks, which leads to the creation of neighborhood pockets.

Row_260,"Understanding how mobility-based green space exposure influences momentary wellbeing is vital to promote life quality. Based on a survey conducted in 2017 characterizing residents' daily activities and environmental pollution exposure in Meiheyuan Community of Beijing, we use Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Green View Index (GVI) to gauge the amount and visibility of exposure to green space at the granularity of activity episodes. Structural equation models are formulated to examine direct influences of green space on activity satisfaction, mediating effects of real-time environmental pollution, and environmental justice under a dynamic activity context. Our results show that the amount of greenness boosts activity satisfaction, and that the direct relationship between green visibility and activity satisfaction follows an inverted U-shaped curve. NDVI indirectly affects activity satisfaction by reducing perceived air pollution.

Row_261,"As part of efforts to reduce carbon emissions, the concept of n-minute cities has been proposed. Although many global cities have attempted to implement this idea, there is still a lack of quantitative research on n-minute cities. This study aims to analyze factors that influence living radii by utilizing mobile phone location-based mobility big data and spatial regression analysis, thereby contributing to the implementation of n-minute cities. By distinguishing between pre- and post-COVID-19 periods and between commuting and non-commuting travel, this study reveals decreased average travel distances in the post-pandemic period and identifies factors influencing living radii, thereby favoring the concept of n-minute cities. During the post-COVID-19 period, the impact of factors such as population density, commercial facilities, and the job-housing ratio on travel distance has shifted, while neighborhood living and cultural facilities maintain consistent influence. This underscores the importance of prioritizing these aspects in n-minute city planning. Additionally, the mix of residential and business uses consistently affects shorter commuting distances, highlighting its critical role in n-minute city development. This study is significant for identifying urban environmental factors that effectively reduce living radii based on actual travel behaviors.","Kim, Yejin","Lee, Sugie",,,,,,,,,,,,,0,CITIES,N -minute city,15-Minute city,Travel distance,Mobile phone location-based mobility big data,COVID-19,COMMUTING PATTERNS,BUILT ENVIRONMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2025,Neighborhood-level determining factors of travel distance by trip purpose: Policy implications for the N-minute city
Row_262,"Shared mobility services, such as on-demand ride-hailing, car sharing, and bike sharing, have significantly expanded the mobility tools available to urban residents. Understanding how these technologies are adopted over time is critical towards developing appropriate transportation policy measures. Most fundamentally: is adoption over time driven by demographic or geographic diffusion or a combination of the two? This study uses 2016 and 2018 survey data to explore the demographic and spatial predictors of changes in the adoption of ondemand ride-hailing, car sharing, and bike sharing in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) in Ontario, Canada. This study uses both descriptive statistics and inferential models to identify changes in the adoption process between 2016 and 2018. Trivariate ordered models estimated using diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS) suggest that spatial diffusion plays a role (accounting for 9-44% of changes in adoption between 2016 and 2018), that joint demographic-spatial patterns explain some variation in adoption over time (4-11%), but that demographic controls explain most changes in adoption over time (approximately 39-49%). Notably, adoption is concentrated (albeit somewhat less so over time) among younger cohorts, and it increases among women, among larger households, and among households without children. It is unclear how these changes in adoption will be impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and future studies should explore the non-linear and complex nature of technology adoption, including the relative roles of service supply and demand changes.","Sweet, Matthias N.","Scott, Darren M.",,,,,,,,,,,,,5,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Technology adoption,On-demand ride-hailing,Car sharing,Bike sharing,Ontario,AUTOMATED VEHICLES INSIGHTS,CAR USE EVIDENCE,BIKE-SHARE,EARLY ADOPTERS,ONE-WAY,TRAVEL,OWNERSHIP,MODEL,SERVICE,CHOICE,,,,,,,OCT 2021,Shared mobility adoption from 2016 to 2018 in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area: Demographic or geographic diffusion?

However, contact between racial groups depends not merely on where people live, but also on where they travel over the course of everyday activities. To capture this reality, we propose a new measure of racial segregation - the segregated mobility index (SMI) - that captures the extent to which neighbourhoods of given racial compositions are connected to other types of neighbourhoods in equal measure. Based on hundreds of millions of geotagged tweets sent by over 375,000 Twitter users in the 50 largest US cities, we show that the SMI captures a distinct element of racial segregation, one that is related to, but not solely a function of, residential segregation. A city's racial composition also matters; minority group threat, especially in cities with large Black populations and a troubled legacy of racial conflict, appears to depress movement across neighbourhoods in ways that produce previously undocumented forms of racial segregation. Our index, which could be constructed using other data sources, expands the possibilities for studying dynamic forms of racial segregation including their effects and shifts over time.","Candipan, Jennifer","Phillips, Nolan Edward","Sampson, Robert J.","Small, Mario",,,,,,,,,,,50,URBAN STUDIES,big data,inequality,migration,neighbourhood,race,segregation,ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS,ACTIVITY SPACES,BIG DATA,NEIGHBORHOOD,GEOGRAPHIES,INEQUALITY,PATTERNS,HOME,,,,,,,,NOV 2021,From residence to movement: The nature of racial segregation in everyday urban mobility

Our key findings demonstrate that the Chinese government applies distinctive strategies to control different types of Muslim spaces: The temporary religious places for foreign Muslims are significantly visible for market-driven purposes, and the Sinicization policy regulates the permanent and daily Muslim spaces. The government-led religious control we discuss in this article reflects a pragmatic and fragmented process in China's economy-centered modernization and a cultural monism strategy in the global era. This government-led governance of religions is resisted by foreign Muslims who expect a multicultural governance pattern.

To date, most of these studies come from cities in the Global North, the majority with well-managed governance structures and less inequality. Less is known about how well bikeshare systems work in the highly fragmented and unequal cities that characterize Latin America. Using both primary and secondary data, we analyzed equity through the five Ws of bikeshare in Santiago, Chile, exploring which population groups are using the system ('who'), travel purposes ('what') and time periods ('when'), from/to which locations ('where') and the reasons behind using this transport alternative ('why'). To do this, we used three main data sources: data from tracked trips of bikeshare cyclists (BSC) using the primary system in Santiago (Bike Santiago system run by Tembici), Santiago's Origin-Destination Survey data for own bike cyclists (OBC), and a survey of BSC. This article contributes to current knowledge about bikeshare and equity in a still underexplored Latin American context with limited bikeshare data, providing some conclusions regarding the adaptation of these systems to local contexts. In line with findings elsewhere, we found that the largest group of users consisted of educated men aged 25-45 from medium-to high-income neighborhoods, mainly using the system to travel to work. Santiago's fragmented governance has limited the placement of bikeshare systems in low-and middle-income communities and left them with few intermodal alternatives to relevant destinations. As a result, bikeshare mimics the existing inequity and economic concentration patterns that characterize Santiago's daily mobility. Based on these findings, we suggest key considerations and local adaptations that could improve, expand, and redistribute bikeshare facilities to attract currently excluded users.","Tiznado-Aitken, Ignacio","Fuenzalida-Izquierdo, Jorge","Sagaris, Lake","Mora, Rodrigo",,,,,,,,,,,10,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Bikeshare,Cycling,Equity,Mobility,Santiago,Chile,BICYCLE,TRANSPORT,CITY,IMPLEMENTATION,IMPACTS,SHARE,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2021,"Using the five Ws to explore bikeshare equity in Santiago, Chile"
Row_266,"Population movement has become one of the main vehicles for information transfer, factor flow, and resource allocation between cities. It is also considered as the main way to form the structure of regional organizational networks. This study analyzes the population movement channels, spatial patterns, and evolutionary mechanisms of the Yangtze River Delta with fused data (i.e., long-scale population migration and short-scale 48-hour population movement.), The results show that the population movement presents multipolar and decentralized evolutionary characteristics, and the population movement network in the Yangtze River Delta region has entered a complex network stage, showing a spider web-like convergent nested structure in terms of the population movement at a long time scale (2009-2017). The gravity model reveals that cost factors such as Spatiotemporal distance of population migration and boundary effects between urban nodes are complementary to the urban environment constituted by economic dynamics and social environment. Cultural exchange and regional integration are also quietly removing the cost-benefit constraints of population migration, thereby changing the mediating and diluting effects of the region. (1) Shanghai has not shown the great advantage of being the first city in the region; strong population movement mostly occurs within the provinces, with less cross-provincial movement; (2) population movement is more likely to occur between large and small cities, rather than between large or small cities, two cities with similar industrial structures are more likely to attract and connect with each other, (3) the institutional adhesion of administrative boundaries may have been diluted by the substitution effect of high housing prices, and (4) the stability of land property rights due to driving the regional integration process.

Yet, evidence on the benefits of polycentricity in the transportation sector remains less studied, and previous research has found mixed results. Besides, to our knowledge, none of the previous research focuses on trip chains or tours (sequence of trips that begins and ends at home) in centers. This paper investigates trip chaining efficiency in 28 U.S. regions, comparing three different types of tours, i.e., tours that are within a center, tours that are partially inside a center, and tours that are completely outside a center. I consider a tour to be efficient if it comprises travel modes other than the personal automobile. The results of parametric tests show that tours within a center are associated with higher walk, bike, and transit mode shares and lower car share. Effect sizes are larger for walk and car shares than for bike and transit shares. The findings of this research can encourage and guide planners to design environments that promote active transportation while maximizing resident access to services and amenities and minimizing their expenditure on mobility and travel time.","Sabouri, Sadegh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,CITIES,Center,Polycentric development,Compactness,Trip chaining,travel tour,Active transportation,SPATIAL STRUCTURE,URBAN FORM,BUILT ENVIRONMENT,COMMUTING PATTERNS,DAILY TRAVEL,MODE CHOICE,EMPLOYMENT,PRODUCTIVITY,NETHERLANDS,DISTANCES,,,,,,OCT 2021,Assessing polycentric development in terms of trip chaining efficiency

While there are approaches to sense the urban heartbeat using sound, vision, radio frequency (RF), and other sensors, capturing changes at urban scale using such sensing modalities is challenging. Due to the enormous amount of data they produce and the associated annotation and processing requirement, such data can be of limited use. In this paper, we present a vision-to-language modeling approach to capture patterns and transitions that occur in New York City from March 2020 to August 2020. We use the model on ~1 million street images captured by dashcams over 6 months. We then use the captions to train a language model based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation [4] and compare models from different periods using probabilistic distance measures. We observe distribution shifts in the model that correlate well with social distancing policies and are corroborated by different data sources, such as mobility traces.

Row_269,"Precise travel route identification is the guiding basis of feasible urban traffic planning and modeling. A range of map matching (MM) algorithms have been studied in previous research to integrate coordinate-based GPS data with digital road network information to identify personal travel route. However, these methods significantly depend on the high-density positioning data, which are usually unavailable or costly for transportation planning projects. Fortunately, mobile phones under 3 G, 4 G and 5 G networks can generate massive cell-based travel trajectory data with almost no additional cost. This data is potentially valuable for travel route identification if proper MM algorithms can be developed. This paper proposes an MM method to detect travel route by using handoff trajectory data from the cellular phone network. First, a wireless communication simulation model for dynamic cellular handoff-based traffic monitoring is developed for handoff data collection. Second, the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) algorithm is used to identify travel route by finding the time-space relationship among the cellular handoff patterns of the road network. Finally, by comparing the performance of the proposed method with classical sequence similarity algorithms, results indicate that the EMD-based MM algorithm is much more efficient for travel route identification, and it can detect small spacing parallel roads with a high accuracy.","Yao, Zhenxing","Wang, Yanchen","Yang, Fei","Cheng, Yang","Ran, Bin",,,,,,,,,,4,JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS,EMD algorithm,handoff data,map matching,travel route identification,PERFORMANCE,NAVIGATION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 8 2021,Map matching for travel route identification based on Earth Mover's Distance algorithm using wireless cell trajectory data
Row_270,"Literature in population and development studies has examined the positive effects of rural-urban migration on the livelihoods and living standards of migrant workers. Less attention has been paid to the rural households trapped in poverty despite having family members working in the city. Drawing on a survey of rural households in the north of Jiangsu province, China, this paper examines how migration and an urban income affect the consumption patterns of poor rural households. The results confirm that among the rural poor, households with migrating members tend to have higher disposable incomes than immobile households. However, considerably higher living costs in the city compel these migrant households to be frugal and often split the family between the city and the rural home to minimize total household expenditures. Their incomes are often depleted by the costs of essential goods and services, such as housing, education, medication, transport, and other daily necessities. The findings reflect that many of China's poorest rural households are on the horns of a dilemma-having a job in the city mitigates poverty but often leads to the misery of family separation and the need to endure harsh living conditions for family members in the city. This urges policy changes to facilitate family migration and enhance rural welfare and resource provisions, especially in healthcare and education.","Hao, Pu","Tang, Shuangshuang",,,,,,,,,,,,,4,HABITAT INTERNATIONAL,Migration,Consumption,Expenditure,Poverty,Social mobility,China,FLOATING POPULATION,MIGRANT HOUSEHOLDS,FOOD EXPENDITURE,LABOR MIGRATION,REMITTANCES,INVESTMENT,HEALTH,IMPACT,CONSTRAINTS,EDUCATION,,,,,,JUL 2023,Migration and consumption among poor rural households in China

Particularly using smartphones, GPS provides highly detailed digital trace data, enabling in-depth analysis of human movement behavior. However, there are significant challenges when working with GPS datasets that have a low frequency, which often occurs due to storage capacity limitations or data transmission costs. This study explores methodologies for reconstructing movement paths from low-frequency GPS datasets. The process includes several key steps: data pre-processing involving cleaning and normalizing data; aligning GPS data with existing road networks using the nearest-neighbor KD-Tree algorithm; and accurate path reconstruction. In addition, the study develops a method for time interpolation estimation to determine movement times between the aligned coordinate points. The findings of this research indicate that with the proposed approach, movement paths can be reconstructed effectively and accurately, even from data with low sampling frequencies. This approach promises a wide potential application, ranging from transportation infrastructure planning to the development of more sophisticated navigation systems.

The optimization of rural settlements is of great significance to comprehensively promote rural revitalization. Considering that the optimization of rural settlements is a systematic engineering of the optimal allocation of rural revitalization elements and a social engineering of rural residents' willingness, this paper explores the optimization of rural settlements based on the elements of rural revitalization and rural residents' social mobility. After constructing the theoretical framework of the internal relationship among rural revitalization, rural residents' social mobility and optimization of rural settlements, we evaluate the development vitality of rural settlements from the perspectives of industry, talent, culture, organization and ecology, and measure the network centrality of rural settlements based on rural residents' social mobility. Moreover, we measure the coordination level of development vitality and network centrality to identify rural settlements' optimization types. The level of the talent element is the lowest among the five revitalization elements. The rural settlements with high development vitality and network centrality are mainly distributed around the central town and near the traffic trunk lines. The rural settlements within the boundary of the expansion of urban construction land are classified as suburban integration, and the rural settlements with the characteristics of cultural relics or ethnic minorities are determined as characteristic protection. The remaining rural settlements are classified into three types (i.e., agglomeration and upgrading (high coordination), maintaining status quo (basic coordination), relocation and evacuation (endangered coordination)) according to the coordination level. Relocation and evacuation rural settlements are not suitable for villagers' production and living and we encourage these villagers migrate to rural settlements that are more strongly connected in the residents' social mobility network.

This study utilizes mobility data from the return-tohome phase of Chunyun in 2020 and employs the Random Forest (RF) model to construct a nonlinear explanatory framework for the push-pull effects and their asymmetry in intercity population migration. The findings reveal three key insights: Firstly, there is a notable asymmetry between push and pull effects in the predictive importance of feature variables. Pull effects at the destination are more prominent for economic and employment factors, whereas push effects at the origin are more influential for factors related to the living environment and gender differences. Secondly, we identify the phase transition points and threshold intervals of coupling effects based on the variations in the shapes, gradients, and thresholds of the nonlinear push-pull effects. In addition, we examine the disparities in the context of push and pull dynamics for the interaction effects of multiple variables. Thirdly, heterogeneity in demographic subsamples and different urban scenarios is observed, with within-group differences exhibiting various patterns of change. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers to develop targeted population policies that account for the complex interplay of push and pull factors.","Shi, Feng","Geng, Wei","Huang, Runhua","Mao, Yanwu","Jia, Jianmin",,,,,,,,,,0,CITIES,Intercity population migration,City characteristics,Push-pull mechanisms,Nonlinear and asymmetric analysis,Heterogeneity analysis,Random forest,INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION,LABOR MIGRATION,DETERMINANTS,UNEMPLOYMENT,MOBILITY,TRAVEL,,,,,,,,,,FEB 2025,Push-pull mechanisms in China's intercity population migration: Nonlinearity and asymmetry

Matches were measured through comparisons between the share of traffic flux and that of road resources both globally and locally. First, a global analysis with Gini coefficient revealed the match in Beijing is at a long-lasting low level. Then, the spatiotemporal disparity of match was examined via our proposed regional match index. Specifically, overallocated areas (traffic flux ex-ceeds its corresponding shares of road resources) were mainly along arterial roads, while underallocated ones were in suburbs and gated residential communities.

However, AVs are also likely to increase travel demand which could diminish the potential for AVs to reduce congestion and cause emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) and other air pollutants to increase. Therefore, understanding how AVs will affect travel demand is critical to understanding their potential benefits and impacts. We evaluate how adoption of AVs affects travel demand, congestion and vehicle emissions over several decades using an integrated travel demand, land-use and air quality modeling framework for the Albuquerque, New Mexico metropolitan area. We find that AVs are likely to increase demand and GHG emissions as development patterns shift to the region's periphery and trips become longer. Congestion declines along most roadways as expanded capacity from more efficient AV operation outpaces increasing demand. Most of the population can also expect a reduction in exposure to toxic vehicle emissions.

The algorithm applies Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) technique onto street networks, rather than traditional areal units, in one case study borough in London; it then maps the detected crime ""hot streets"" by crime type. It was found that the algorithm could successfully generate ""hot street"" maps for Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs), enabling more effective allocation of police patrolling; and bear enough resilience itself for the Strategic Crime Analysis (SCA) team's sustainable utilization, by either updating the inputs with latest data or modifying the model parameters (i.e. the kernel function, and the range of spillover). Moreover, this study explores contextual characteristics of crime ""hot streets"" by applying various regression models, in recognition of the best fitted Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model, encompassing eight significant contextual factors with their varied effects on crimes at different streets.

This information is especially important in the Mediterranean islands, due to their unique character. Here we address these aspects, including the way they are affected by UGS perceived adequacy, accessibility, maintenance, distance, and other self-reported obstacles using a questionnaire completed by 703 residents of the Island of Crete, Greece. To integrate results, main covariates are compiled into the newly developed public UGS approval index.

Row_281,"Homeless people have become more visible in China in recent years. However, research on Chinese homelessness in general and homeless migrants in particular is still very limited. Based on the China Migrants Dynamic Survey, this pioneering exploration of the geography of homeless migrants in China arrives at three conclusions. First, although homeless migrants are often scorned as an underclass of derelict drifters, the majority are educated, married, and employed, sometimes temporarily. Second, although most homeless migrants congregate in the most developed coastal regions, the number of homeless migrants as a proportion of total migrants is relatively high in some remote provinces, with significant numbers residing in rural areas. Third, in addition to the three established drivers: the housing market, economic opportunity, and social support, prejudice towards the homeless is shown to be an important factor in the concentration of homeless migrants and their exclusion from urban society. This paper contributes to an understanding of homeless migrants in China and the factors accounting for their spatial distribution.","Gong, Yue","Xu, Yifang","Xie, Bo","Maclachlan, Ian","Chen, Yujie",,,,,,,,,,0,POPULATION SPACE AND PLACE,homelessness,housing situation,migrants,migration pattern,prejudice,MOBILITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2025,Homelessness and migration: The geography of homeless migrants in China

This study analyses children's active school travel, its individual, family, socioeconomic and environmental determinants and spatial pattern in Leipzig, Germany. We evaluated the school travel behaviour of 217 eight-year-olds from a prospective birth cohort study called LINA (Lifestyle and Environmental Factors and their Influence on Newborns Allergy Risk). Variables from the LINA questionnaire were combined with data from administrative bodies. We applied logistic regressions to identify the determinants of active travel. Our results show that active school travel decreases from city centre to suburban areas, and that route length, perceived traffic and the residential environment have the greatest influence on which mode of travel is selected. Our findings enable us to suggest improvements in school district delineation in suburban areas that would facilitate active travel.","Schicketanz, Juliane","Roeder, Stefan","Herberth, Gunda","Kabisch, Sigrun","Lakes, Tobia",,,,,,,,,,4,CHILDRENS GEOGRAPHIES,Active school travel,school journey,children's travel,physical activity,health geography,BUILT ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES,PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY LEVELS,INDEPENDENT MOBILITY,MODE CHOICE,NEIGHBORHOOD,TRANSPORT,ASSOCIATIONS,HEALTH,URBAN,WALKABILITY,,,,,,,MAR 4 2022,On foot or by car: what determines children's active school travel?
Row_283,"Quantifying the intensity of spatial connections has been a crucial topic in many research fields, such as urban transportation, migration, and trade. Researchers have proposed various models, such as the gravity model and the radiation model, to quantify the magnitude of spatial connections. Traditionally, modeling the connections (relatedness) between spatial entities is limited to the physical space, but with the rapid growth of information technologies, the scope of spatial connections extends to the virtual space. However, one topic that has not been fully studied is how spatial scale may impact spatial connections in the virtual space and how this influence can be reflected in spatial decay models. In this study, we used two types of datasets (mass media and social media data) to explore the impact of scale on fitting the distance decay coefficient. The results confirmed that spatial scale can impact the magnitude of spatial decay effects in datasets with different characteristics.","Yuan, Yihong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,"30TH INTERNATIONAL CARTOGRAPHIC CONFERENCE (ICC 2021), VOL 4",Big geo-data,Mass media,Location-based social media (LBSM),Distance decay,TOBLERS 1ST LAW,KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY,MASS-MEDIA,MOBILITY,MIGRATION,PATTERNS,TRADE,MODEL,,,,,,,,,,2021,The impact of scale on spatial connections: an exploratory analysis
Row_284,"The United States largely depends on the automobile for personal transportation. This dominance has significant consequences for society over a range of issues, including the environment, public safety, public health, and equity. The issues associated with the dominance of the automobile are most pressing in the suburbs due to their size and curvilinear street network patterns. Thus, any effort to address the negative consequences of automobile dependency in the US needs to consider retrofitting the suburbs and their street networks. We attempt to better understand the potential for street network retrofits to increase suburban pedestrian access. We consider a class of planar graph augmentation problems that attempt to increase pedestrian access to points of interest (POIs) within the study area by adding new pedestrian paths to the street network that follow existing property lines. Our methodology builds on past work on graph dilation and route directness, from the planar graph and street network communities, respectively, to score the pedestrian access disruption of individual blocks. We apply this methodology to a case study of suburban Seattle. We find that, both in the limit of all possible interventions and with a limited number of untargeted interventions, retrofits can meaningfully increase pedestrian access to POIs. Given this promise, the methods we outline present a useful starting point for discussing the potential of street network retrofits to serve non-automobile mobility in suburban communities across the US.","Aras, Rohan L.","Ouellette, Nicholas T.","Jain, Rishee K.",,,,,,,,,,,,1,ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE,Suburban retrofitting,street networks,urban analytics,pedestrians,urban morphology,CONNECTIVITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 2024,Quantifying the pedestrian access potential of suburban street network retrofits

Eventually this wide-spread fleet of minibus taxis will have to transition to electric vehicles. This paper examines the impact of this inevitable evolution on a citywide scale in Kampala, Uganda. We present a generic simulation environment to assess the grid impact and charging opportunities, given the unique paratransit mobility patterns. We used floating car data to assess the energy requirements of electric minibus taxis, which will have a knock-on effect on the region's already fragile electrical grid. We used spatio-temporal and solar photovoltaic analyses to assess the informal and formal stops that would be needed for the taxis to recharge from solar PV in the region's abundant sunshine. The results showed that the median energy demand across all simulated days of the fleet of taxis was 220 kWh/d. This ranged to a maximum of 491 kWh/d, with a median charging potential (stationary time) across taxis of 8 h/d to 12 h/d. The median potential for charging from solar PV ranged from 0.24 kWh/m(2) to 0.52 kWh/m(2) per day, across the taxis. Our simulator and results will allow traffic planners and grid operators to assess and plan for looming electric vehicle roll-outs to the most-used mode of transport in Africa.","Booysen, M.

Row_287,"Accessibility is an effective variable for identifying mobility needs and evaluating transport inequalities. In recent years, the construction of transport facilities has been often considered to have a significant effect on the accessibility of cities. This study focused on the regional inequalities of transport accessibility in China and the influence of transport mode disparity. A novel approach integrating intercity and intracity transport networks is modeled for detailed calculations of travel time using open-source massive path data. The proposed approach provides further improvement in the accuracy, and it can reflect realistic patterns of multiscale accessibility. Four indicators based on travel time estimation were employed to evaluate transport accessibility and inequality: weighted average travel time (WATT), potential value (PV), daily accessibility (DA), and coefficient of variation (CV). Results show that transport accessibility is the highest in the eastern region, followed by the midland, northeastern, and western regions; this trend is consistent with the level of urban development and transport facilities construction. The inequality of transport accessibility between cities is obvious, and the western region has a considerably greater inequality than other areas. With regard to transport facilities, the car driving mode has higher accessibility and lower discrepancy than the public transit mode at the national level; however, the construction of public transit infrastructure, especially the high-speed railway, should considerably improve the daily accessibility of cities. Several policy suggestions are provided for transport departments and decision makers that can effectively improve the level and equality of transport accessibility of cities in China.","Qian, Tianlu","Fu, Zheng","Chen, Jie","Qin, Shujie","Xi, Changbai","Wang, Jiechen",,,,,,,,,0,JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SYSTEMS,Inequality,Multiscale accessibility,Multimode transportation,Open-source massive path data,China,HIGH-SPEED RAIL,PUBLIC-TRANSIT ACCESSIBILITY,TRAVEL-TIME,INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS,REGIONAL ACCESSIBILITY,IMPACTS,ACCESS,GIS,NETWORK,EQUITY,,,,,,,APR 2023,Evaluating multiscale and multimodal transport inequalities in Chinese cities with massive open-source path data

This study quantifies health risks associated with the consumption of vegetables grown in the floodplain of the urban river 'Yamuna' in the highly polluted yet data-scarce megacity Delhi, India. Six trace elements are analyzed in five kinds of vegetable samples. Soil samples from the cultivation area are also analyzed for elemental contamination. Ni, Mn, and Co are observed to be higher in leafy vegetables than others. Fruit and inflorescence vegetables are found to have higher concentrations of Cr, Pb, and Zn as compared to root vegetables. Transfer Factor indicates that Cr and Co have the highest and least mobility, respectively. Vegetable Pollution Index indicates that contamination levels follow as Cr > Ni > Pb > Zn. Higher Metal Pollution Index of leafy and inflorescence vegetables than root and fruit vegetables indicate that atmospheric deposition is the predominant source. Principal Component Analysis indicates that Pb and Cr have similar sources and patterns in accumulation. Among the analyzed vegetables, radish may pose a non-carcinogenic risk to the age group of 1-5 year. Carcinogenic risk is found to be potentially high due to Ni and Cr accumulation. Consumption of leafy vegetables was found to have relatively less risk than other vegetables due to lower Cr accumulation.

Row_289,"Drawing on the politicised history of Public Conveniences in England since the 19th century, this paper traces the socio-political motives for their provision and for their gradual withdrawal in recent decades. It discusses the effects these developments have had on public mobility, and the socio-political complexity these infrastructures pose to city-making agendas. In particular, the essay highlights the notions of stigma associated with these spaces in relation to gender, body-politics and control, which led to a lack of political interest in their provision and a pattern of closures that began in the Thatcher era and has continued through later times of economic austerity. To unfold these arguments, the essay examines a series of initiatives put forward to reclaim for public use a derelict toilet in the centre of London: from the concept of an interactive site-specific intervention to raise awareness of its closure, to a campaign for its listing as an Asset of Community Value, to contest its privatisation. This case study is used to address the spatial stigma that public toilets carry as a contested locus of public sanitation and, furthermore, to highlight important questions surrounding their provision in the context of contemporary citizen-driven urban agendas. To articulate this argument, the case study exemplifies how critical spatial practices can operate as a form of pedagogical urban praxis for awareness-raising and citizen engagement, advancing a Lefebvrian 'right to the city' against hegemonic neoliberal agendas.","Pollak Williamson, Catalina",,,,,,,,,,,,,,11,URBAN STUDIES,critical play,critical spatial practice,public toilets,right to the city,spatial stigma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 2022,"'Fountain', from Victorian necessity to modern inconvenience: Contesting the death of public toilets"

Its drivers and characteristic features are complex and diverse, ranging from the displacement of low-income households to the redevelopment of commercial districts. This paper combines multiple data sources to explore the coevolution of gentrification in the residential market and developments in non-residential sectors in the Canadian city of Toronto. Analysis starts from a max-p-regions clustering based on a composite measure of the gentrification process, which includes measures of household income, educational attainment, building permits, and the composition of establishments. The variables that describe each region are examined for patterns of gentrification. We then develop a Bayesian hierarchical spatial (BHS) model to describe the change in residential property prices over the five-year period between 2011 and 2016. The results show that establishment entropy and composition are found to influence residential property prices, with significant spatial variation in its effect.

Household income has a negative effect on non-motorized travel in the non-elderly, but a positive effect in elderly patients. Highly mixed land use, intensive urban development, and difficulty in parking discourage non-elderly patients from traveling by car, but none of these factors have a significant effect on the elderly.

In this Viewpoint, I present a systemwide approach to financing and fulfilling the transportation needs of those who do not drive while at the same time providing a congestion-free travel choice for those who do. It combines congestion pricing with cash rewards for those who choose to share rides on a network of congestion-free lanes converted from general-use lanes to priced lanes. Net revenues support multimodal travel options including transit, carpooling, and mobility hubs with transportation services to and from trip origins and final destinations, also known as first- and last-mile services. The strategy would allow existing metropolitan freeway networks to be transformed into financially viable, sustainable, and equitable multimodal systems providing high-quality travel choices that could lead to more sustainable urban development patterns.","DeCorla-Souza, Patrick",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION,cash rewards,congestion pricing,high-occupancy toll lanes,sustainable development,transportation financing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2 2024,A Sustainable and Equitable Approach to Financing Multimodal Transportation Alternatives in Metropolitan Areas

In this way, it was possible to observe positive changes in the perceptions of children's statements and in the social norms of their caregivers about transportation, as well as significant modal shifts as reported by caregivers towards sustainable mobility, which were evaluated using difference-in-differences and time-series analyses. Besides the identification of changes in the behavior of adult caregivers through child-centered intervention types, this empirical research enabled unraveling the effect of the proposed measures according to the child's gender, nationality, and level of social vulnerability, including the significant modal shifts towards walking and cycling identified among caregivers of boys and out of car and motorcycle among those of native children, which were significant both in post and follow-up measures.

Row_294,"Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is a classical modeling method for dealing with spatial non-stationarity. It incorporates the distance decay effect in space to fit local regression models, where distance is defined as Euclidean distance. Although this definition has been expanded, it remains focused on physical distance. However, in the era of globalization and informatization, where the phenomenon of remotely close association is common, physical distance may not reflect real spatial proximity, and GWR based on physical distance has clear limitations. This paper proposes a geographically weighted regression based on a network weight matrix (NWM GWR) model. This does not rely on geographical location modeling; instead, it uses network distance to measure the proximity between two regions and weights observations by improving the kernel function to achieve distance attenuation. We adopt the population mobility network to establish a network weight matrix, modeling China's urbanization and its multidimensional driving factors using network autocorrelation and NWM GWR methods. Results show that the NWM GWR model has more accurate fit and better stability than ordinary least squares and GWR models, and better reveals relationships between variables, which makes it suitable for modeling economic and social systems more broadly.","He, Jingyi","Wei, Ye","Yu, Bailang",,,,,,,,,,,,10,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE,Network weight matrix,geographically weighted regression,network distance,spatial non-stationarity,ordinary least squares,EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE,LANDSCAPE PATTERN,1ST LAW,POPULATION,URBAN,MIGRATION,COUNTRIES,,,,,,,,,,JUN 3 2023,Geographically weighted regression based on a network weight matrix: a case study using urbanization driving force data in China

The widely used hedonic pricing model for houses was proposed from the perspective of space, focusing mostly on static house structural information and objective built environment factors. However, the value of house settlement is not only determined by its spatial settings, but also varies from one place to another with different cultures, human dynamics, human perceptions and social interactions. In this work, we introduce a place-oriented hedonic pricing model (P-HPM) that incorporates human dynamics and human perceptions of places to understand human settlement. As an empirical study, we employ a large volume of house price data in Boston and Los Angeles, including detailed house and locational amenity information. Besides, we take the hourly number of visits to places as a proxy of human mobility patterns, and obtain human perceptions of places extracted from large-scale street-view images using deep learning. The results show that the P-HPM outperformed the traditional HPM significantly in these two cities. Moreover, through a geographically weighted regression analysis and the Monte Carlo test, we find that the impacts of the proposed place-related variables on house prices are stable across space.

Row_296,"Understanding residential mobility, housing affordability, and the geography of neighborhood advantage and disadvantage relies on robust information about housing search processes and housing markets. Existing data about housing markets, especially rental markets, suffer from accuracy issues and a lack of temporal and geographic flexibility. Data collected from online rental platforms that are commonly used can help address these issues and hold considerable promise for better understanding the full distribution of available rental homes. However, realizing this promise requires a careful assessment of potential sources of bias as online rental listing platforms may perpetuate inequalities similar to those found in physical spaces. This paper approaches the production of rental advertisements as a social process driven by both contextual and property level factors. We compare data from two online platforms for the 100 most populated metropolitan areas in the United States to explore inequality in digital rental listing spaces and understand what characteristics are associated with over and underrepresentation of advertisements in certain areas. We find similar associations for socioeconomic measures between platforms and across urban and suburban parts of these metropolitan areas. In contrast, the importance of racial and ethnic composition, as well as broader patterns of segregation, for online representation differs substantially across space and platform. This analysis informs our understanding of how online platforms affect housing search dynamics through their biases and segmentation, and highlights the potential and limits in using the data available on these platforms to produce small area rental estimates.","Hess, Chris","Acolin, Arthur","Walter, Rebecca","Kennedy, Ian","Chasins, Sarah","Crowder, Kyle",,,,,,,,,9,ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE,Residential mobility,online rental listings,rental housing markets,housing search,inequality,FAIR MARKET RENTS,CITIES,OPPORTUNITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2021,"Searching for housing in the digital age: Neighborhood representation on internet rental housing platforms across space, platform, and metropolitan segregation"

Although some studies have explored the usage characteristics and effects of the built environment on ESS ridership using one city as an example, few studies have considered multiple cities to obtain generalizable and robust results. To fill this research gap, we collect the ESS trip data of five cities in the U.S., namely Austin, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Louisville, and Portland, and explore the effects of the built environment on ESS ridership after controlling for socioeconomic factors. The temporal distributions of e-scooter ridership of different cities are similar, having a single peak period on weekdays and weekends between 11:30 and 17:30. In terms of spatial distribution, the ESS ridership is higher in universities and urban centers compared to other areas. Multilevel negative binomial model results show that ESS trips are positively correlated with population density, employment density, intersection density, land use mixed entropy, and bus stop density in the census block group. E-scooter ridership is negatively correlated with the median age of the population in the census block group and distance to the city center. The findings in this article can help operators understand the factors that affect the ridership of shared e-scooters, determine the changes in ridership when the built environment changes, and identify high-ridership areas when ESS is implemented in new cities.","Huo, Jinghai","Yang, Hongtai","Li, Chaojing","Zheng, Rong","Yang, Linchuan","Wen, Yi",,,,,,,,,88,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Travel demand,Land use,Multilevel model,Spatiotemporal data,Micro mobility,Shared mobility,BIKE-SHARE,TRANSIT RIDERSHIP,USAGE PATTERNS,WASHINGTON,AUSTIN,TRAVEL,,,,,,,,,,MAY 2021,Influence of the built environment on E-scooter sharing ridership: A tale of five cities

This paper attempts to construct a theoretical framework of rural multidimensional hollowing from the perspective of population outflow, and to comprehensively assess the level of rural hollowing from the dimensions of population, economy and land. Based on this, this paper describes in detail the characteristics and facts of population outflow and rural hollowing in Longxi County, which is located in Longzhong Loess Hilly Regin. The key factors of rural hollowing are identified in terms of individual characteristics, geographic environment and socio-economic attributes. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) Longxi County has significant spatial differences in population outflow. The proportion of floating population in the household population is as high as 28.6%. The villages with intra-provincial preferences show a ""center-periphery"" circle distribution pattern, and villages with extra-provincial preferences are mainly located in the boundary area. The rural hollowing level of Longxi is characterized by ""economic hollowing (Eh) > population hollowing (Ph) > land hollowing (Lh)"". The hollowing level of each dimension has different spatial distribution characteristics, and the rural hollowing (Rh) level shows a spatial pattern of ""high in the east and low in the west, high in the south and low in the north"". (3) The influencing factors of rural hollowing vary significantly and are greatly influenced by the geographical and socio-economic attributes of the villages. When one factor (economic or geographical environment) is dominant, low-intensity intra-provincial mobility may occur. However, when all factors are combined, a high-intensity, multi-directional flow trend emerges within and outside the province. This study contributes theoretical insights into understanding the social changes in rural areas during the rapid urbanization process where population outflows occur, and can also provide inspiration for addressing issues in rural transformation.","Shi, Zhihao","Ma, Libang","Li, Ziyan","Wu, Shanshan","Chen, Xianfei",,,,,,,,,,0,APPLIED SPATIAL ANALYSIS AND POLICY,Population outflow,Multidimensional hollowing,Influencing factors,"Longzhong loess Hilly Region, China",URBAN MIGRATION,EXODUS,REVITALIZE,MOUNTAINS,COUNTRIES,REFORM,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 2025,"Exploring the Multidimensional Hollowing of Rural Areas in China's Loess Hilly Region from the Perspective of ""Population Outflow"""

This paper investigates the interest level of commuters towards micromobility, rental service preference, and high-demand geo locations in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. From the literature review 28 variables were identified. A semi-structured survey circulated among commuters who frequently travel to the Colombo region, resulted in obtaining 132 responses.

Row_300,"In recent years, several techniques have been presented in the specialized literature to identify the best location for installing public charging stations, considering the demand for charging the batteries of electric vehicles that travel along the main roads in urban areas. However, in cities with different travel patterns for electric vehicle drivers, such consideration may result in charging equipment serving few electric vehicles during high recharging demand. Thus, planning by zone can determine more chargers per station with greater utilization during the operation of charging stations. For this, this work presents a methodology that uses the concept of a charging zone, defined as a circular geographic space with charging equipment that will satisfy the charging demand of electric vehicles in their surroundings. Identifying the centroids of these zones is formulated as a pmedian problem, solved by the Teitz-Bart algorithm to provide more coverage to the demands for electric charging in large urban areas. The proposed methodology was applied in a Brazilian city with approximately 3 million inhabitants to find the spatial distribution of public charging zones, considering six scenarios of the global penetration of electric vehicles. Furthermore, we compared the allocation of the centroids in these zones with the solution determined by commercial geoprocessing software. This comparison shows that the proposal determines a spatial distribution of 10% more of these zones with a load factor closer to 0.5 than the results of the commercial geoprocessing software. More zones with this load factor value contribute to better use of the power distribution network installations. In addition, the proposed methodology finds an average reduction of 319 kW of peak demand in regions with a low flow of electric vehicles to meet their charging needs in each analyzed scenario. This peak-demand reduction may allow less investment in connecting future charging stations to the power distribution network. Therefore, the proposed methodology can help public and private agents to disseminate electric mobility, finding public charging areas with greater utilization of chargers per station during the operation of charging stations.","Faustino, Fausta J.","Lopes, Jose Calixto","Melo, Joel D.","Sousa, Thales","Padilha-Feltrin, Antonio","Brito, Jose A.

Row_301,"With the accelerated aging process, the increased willingness of elderly people to travel, and the concessionary bus travel policy implementation, public transport, especially buses, has become one of the important ways for China's elderly people to participate in social activities. Meanwhile, the increased use of public transport by elderly people results in serious conflicts with commuters. In order to understand details about when, where and why public transport trips of the elderly become large, this study investigates the aggregation degree of public transport use among the elderly as well as its determinants mainly from the viewpoint of spatial characteristics. Based on Smart card data and Baidu Map API, the aggregation degree of public transport use in elderly people is rated on a scale of 1 to 5. And then its correlation to the microscopic built environment is analyzed by using negative binomial regression. The results indicate that public transport use by elderly people is highly aggregative in both spatial and temporal dimensions.
