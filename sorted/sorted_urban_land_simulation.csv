Row_1,"China's rapid urbanization has imposed a considerable strain on land resources and infrastructure, resulting in environmental deterioration, food shortage, traffic congestion, and various other challenges. The urban growth boundary (UGB) is regarded as an important policy instrument for managing and curbing urban sprawl. Previous studies on UGB have focused on the quantity and spatial constraints of built-up land concerning natural resources conservation. However, achieving a balance between urban conservation and development by easing the conflict between land functions is not yet well understood. To bridge this gap, combining ""bottom-up"" local spatial simulation with ""top-down"" regulation and human constraint, this study simulated multi-scenario urban expansion and UGB in Jiangsu Province, China in 2035 using ecological-agricultural-urban suitability assessment and a Future Land Use Simulation (FLUS) model. The results show that the maintenance of different land functions will have a significant impact on the number, spatial distribution, and landscape characteristics of UGB. Under the integrated development scenario, UGB will have the largest area (27,893.33 km2) with the most significant agglomeration characteristics. The delineated UGB, coupling ecological-agricultural-urban suitability, will reflect regional heterogeneous resource endowment and can further alleviate conflicts between multiple objectives. For fairness and equality between cities, future urban expansion should emphasize the development of less-developed areas. This study expands a new insight for simulating urban expansion and offers practical recommendations for orderly urban growth and sustainable urban management in other cities.","Li, Long","Huang, Xianjin","Yang, Hong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,32,CITIES,Urban growth boundary,Ecological -agricultural -urban suitability,Future land use simulation,Cellular automata,Urban expansion,DEM Digital elevation model,FS Food security,CELLULAR-AUTOMATA,DECISION-SUPPORT,CHINA,URBANIZATION,BOUNDARIES,IMPACT,CONSERVATION,VALIDATION,EXPANSION,SERVICES,,,,,,,,,JUN 2023,Scenario-based urban growth simulation by incorporating ecological-agricultural-urban suitability into a Future Land Use Simulation model
Row_2,"Urban expansion threatens natural habitat quality (NHQ) and hinders the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. Whether and how multifunctional urban land use (MFULU) can mitigate NHQ decline under future urban expansion remains unclear. This study developed a theoretical framework for mitigating NHQ decline via MFULU, and examined the mitigation based on a multi-scenario simulation using the Patchgenerating Land use Simulation model and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs model. Three future scenarios, each including MFULU and non-MFULU modes, were considered in the simulation: Business as Usual, Economic Development, and Ecological Priority. Urban expansion led to less encroachment into natural habitats in MFULU modes than in non-MFULU modes. Additionally, natural habitats were less aggregated, and more irregular than in non-MFULU modes under all scenarios, especially those with moderate and higher NHQ levels. Natural habitats were more aggregated and regular in MFULU modes than in non-MFULU modes under all scenarios. These results verified MFULU's positive contributions in preserving natural habitats under the conservation effect of MFULU and improving the landscape patterns of natural habitats under the agglomeration effect of MFULU. The findings have implications for formulating land-sharing policies that realize win-win situations between sustainable urban development and a resilient ecological environment.","Gao, Houxing","Song, Xiaoqing","Xu, Huixiao","Li, Xiang","Tang, Juan","Zhao, Guosong",,,,,,,,,,,,,2,SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY,Multifunctional urban land use,Urban expansion,Natural habitat,Sustainable urban development,Multi -scenario simulation,China,GROWTH,BIODIVERSITY,CHINA,CONSERVATION,EXPANSION,MODEL,AGGLOMERATION,URBANIZATION,BOUNDARIES,AREAS,,,,,,,,,,SEP 1 2024,Promoting sustainable development by mitigation of natural habitat quality decline through multifunctional urban land use: Insights from a multi-scenario simulation
Row_3,"Urban agglomerations (UAs) are the most active areas of urban land expansion. The encroachment of urban land on large-scale ecological land has caused severe ecological problems and threatens the ecological sustainability of UAs. Understanding the characteristics of multi-scenario urban land expansion and its impacts on ecosystem services (ESs) in UAs can provide guidance for formulating ecologically sustainable management and control policies in UAs. However, few studies have simulated the characteristics of multi-scenario urban expansion and determined its impacts on ESs in Chinese UAs. In this study, we used a patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model and the benefit transfer method to conduct a multi-scenario simulation of urban land expansion in Chinese UAs in 2030 and measure its impacts on ESs. The simulation indicates that urban land continued to expand and expanded most severely under an urban development scenario. In the future, under an ecological protection scenario, ESs would be maintained at their highest levels. In general, the global Moran's I indices of the ESs and urban expansion were negative at the 0.001 significance level, indicating that ESs and urban expansion in Chinese UAs were strongly spatially concentrated. The impacts of urban expansion on the ESs varied among the UAs. In national and regional UAs, ESs were affected negatively by patch density (PD) and percentage of like adjacencies (PLADJ), whereas the loss of ESs in local UAs was not only affected by PD and PLADJ, but also by the proportion of urban land. These findings provide effective guidance for improving ESs, urban development planning, and high-quality development in Chinese UAs.","Chen, Wanxu","Wang, Guanzheng","Gu, Tianci","Fang, Chuanglin","Pan, Sipei","Zeng, Jie","Wu, Jiahui",,,,,,,,,,,,20,ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW,Urban expansion simulation,Ecosystem services,Spatial autocorrelation,Spatial regression,Ecosystem services sustainability,Urban agglomeration,China,LAND-USE CHANGE,SPATIAL ASSOCIATION,DYNAMIC SIMULATION,LANDSCAPE PATTERN,MIDDLE REACHES,YANGTZE-RIVER,URBANIZATION,MANAGEMENT,EVOLUTION,XINJIANG,,,,,,,,,NOV 2023,Simulating the impact of urban expansion on ecosystem services in Chinese urban agglomerations: A multi-scenario perspective
Row_4,"Urbanisation is a key aspect of land use change (LUC), and accurately modelling of urban LUC is crucial for sustainable development. Cellular automata (CA) are widely used in LUC research. However, previous studies have overlooked the significant temporal dependence and spatial heterogeneity associated with LUC. To address these gaps, this study proposes a novel model called KCLP-CA, which integrates k-means, a convolutional neural network (CNN), a long and short-term memory neural network (LSTM), and the popular patch-generation land use model (PLUS). Initially, k-means and CNN are utilised to address spatial heterogeneity, while LSTM tackles temporal dependence. The LSTM and land expansion analysis strategy (LEAS) models of PLUS are employed to obtain land use conversion probability maps. Finally, a simulation of land use dynamic change was conducted using a linear weighted fusion conversion probability map that accounts for random factors. To validate the KCLP-CA model, land use data collected from Hangzhou between 1995 and 2000 were employed. The results showed that the KCLP-CA model outperformed traditional methods, including artificial neural networks and random forest model, with the figure of merit (FoM) index increasing from 2.12% to 4.19%. Random forest analysis of drivers impacting LUC revealed that distance to water and road network density exerted the greatest influence on urban land development in Hangzhou. Incorporation of various policy planning factors affecting urban development yielded simulation results aligning more closely with reality, resulting in a FoM index increase of 1.64-1.76%. In summary, the model developed in this study combines the strengths of two sub models to deliver an accurate and effective simulation of future land use.","Huang, Chen","Zhou, Ye","Wu, Tao","Zhang, Mingyue","Qiu, Yu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,Land use change,Deep learning,Spatiotemporal dependency,Urbanisation,GROWTH,EXPANSION,NETWORK,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 2024,A cellular automata model coupled with partitioning CNN-LSTM and PLUS models for urban land change simulation
Row_5,"While many published studies have explored the impact of spatial heterogeneity on land-use change, few have focused on regional differences in land-use transition rules caused by urban spatial structure. In this paper, we measured urban land-use diversity by developing self-adaptive kernel density estimation and entropy weight methods and determine the urban spatial structure (composed of urban regions, inner and outer urban-rural fringes, and a rural hinterland) by applying a spectral clustering method. Combining local neighborhood effects and environmental effects, the land-use transition rules of different types of regions were mined to construct a partitioned vector cellular automata (CA) model that zonally simulates urban land-use change. The proposed model was applied to the simulation of the land-use change process in Jiangyin City, China, from 2007 to 2017. The resulting simulation accuracy was higher than that of other well-accepted CA models that do not consider urban spatial structure, and the conventional neighborhood assimilation rule was found not to be applicable to the conversion of construction land. The results and findings demonstrate that the proposed model is an effective means for urban planners to simulate and analyze urban evolution processes of cities with urban spatial structures that fit a concentric circle model.","Yang, Jing","Zhu, Xinyu","Chen, Wei","Sun, Yizhong","Zhu, Jie",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE,Cellular automata,Urban spatial structure,Self-adaptive kernel density,Spectral clustering,Land-use change,KERNEL DENSITY-ESTIMATION,GRAVITATIONAL-FIELD MODEL,FRINGE,GROWTH,SELECTION,AREA,NEIGHBORHOOD,POPULATION,ALGORITHM,PATTERNS,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2023,Modeling land-use change using partitioned vector cellular automata while considering urban spatial structure
Row_6,"ContextThe rapid urbanization in China has led to acute land use conflicts between urban expansion and the protection of cropland and ecological land, which have also threatened the sustainable use of land resources and regional sustainable development. However, most current land management policies for solving these conflicts focus on short-term economic benefits, neglecting sustainable land management.ObjectivesThe goal is to propose sustainable land management strategies for balancing the coordinated relationships among urban expansion, cropland protection, and ecological protection in the Yangtze River Delta region (YRDR).MethodsWe used a newly proposed patch-generating land use simulation model to determine the key driving factors and to simulate future land use changes under multiple development scenarios in the YRDR. Additionally, we analysed the evolution process of land use dynamics in the YRDR from 2000 to 2050.ResultsFuture urban expansion was projected to be spatially unevenly distributed under different topographic conditions and among different economic development regions, indicating that more consideration should be given to platform regions and less economically developed areas to meet the demand for future construction activities. Additionally, driving factor analysis suggested that governments should take measures to guide the population to economically underdeveloped areas and that the governments of newly developed areas should focus on extending the local road network first.ConclusionsThe methodological framework for integrating future land use simulations with analyses of driving forces and land use evolution processes can alleviate or eliminate land use conflicts to achieve sustainable land management in rapid urbanization regions.","Zhang, Zhonghao","Wang, Xueting","Zhang, Yue","Gao, Yang","Liu, Yuexin","Sun, Ximan","Zhi, Junjun","Yin, Sufang",,,,,,,,,,,25,LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,Land use change,Land use simulation,Urban expansion,Spatiotemporal dynamics,Driving factor,Yangtze River Delta,DRIVING FACTORS,USE CONFLICTS,URBAN-GROWTH,AREA,EXPANSION,DYNAMICS,CHINA,CITY,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2023,Simulating land use change for sustainable land management in rapid urbanization regions: a case study of the Yangtze River Delta region
Row_7,"The conflict between the demands of ecological protection and economic development is increasingly prominent. Land use change is sensitive to whether economic or ecological profits dominate, and prediction of future land use changes has become an important scientific issue. This article constructs a coupled model that comprises the grey model (GM), the fuzzy multiple objective linear programming model (FMOLP) and the future land use simulation model (FLUS). We used this model to calculate a macro-scale quantitative forecast using the top-down GM-FMOLP model, and calculated micro-scale spatial simulations of land use/cover change (LUCC) using the bottom-up FLUS model under three dissimilar future scenarios, with different emphases on ecological and economic benefits. The scenarios were designed to meet different planning requirements in Chongqing: ecological benefits maximization, economic benefits maximization, and combined ecological and economic benefits maximization. The proposed model, FLUS, was applied to a LUCC simulation for Chongqing in 2015, beginning from verified historical land use data from 2010. The results show that the simulation agrees well with the actual land use in 2015. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient are 85.92% and 0.76, respectively, which indicates the model performs well. The three land use types with the highest producer and user accuracies are forest, cropland and water areas. The GM-FMOLP model was used to forecast future LUCC quantity demand, and the FLUS model was then used to calculate spatial predictions for the three scenarios for 2040. The prediction results for the six land use types were significantly different under the three different scenarios. The total areas of forest, urban land and water increased by different degrees under the three scenarios, and the unused land area dwindled. Cropland areas were largely converted into forest, urban land and water areas. The increases in forest and urban land areas generally represents internal gap-filling between disparate areas and peripheral expansion of areas of the same land use type. The increase in water area results from increased surface runoff in mountainous valleys with severe terrain. Areas of unused land are fully transformed into other land use types. The outcomes from the designed scenarios demonstrate that the proposed models are reliable and effective for future LUCC simulation, and highlight key areas where land use changes differently according to the scenario. In summary, in the predictions for the scenario that combined ecological and economic benefits maximization, each land use type tried to maximize ecological and economic benefits under the constraints, taking into account ecological safety and economic growth, which is in line with the coordination, comprehensiveness and binding requirements in Chongqing's development plan. Therefore, this scenario becomes the optimal scenario for land use optimization in Chongqing in the future. This study provides an example of the application of simulation and forecast models in land use management, remediation and urban planning, and addresses the growing requirement for low-cost and effective tools for prediction of dynamic land use succession patterns.","Li, Yuechen","Liu, Xian","Wang, Yue","He, Zhiming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13,LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT,Chongqing,coupled model,land use simulation,land use,cover change (LUCC),multiple scenarios,CELLULAR-AUTOMATA MODEL,LANDSCAPE DYNAMICS,COVER CHANGE,URBAN,PATTERN,SYSTEM,AREA,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2023,Simulating multiple scenarios of land use/cover change using a coupled model to capture ecological and economic effects
Row_8,"The strategic delineation of the urban development boundary (UDB) is an effective initiative for efficient land resource allocation and for facilitating planned urban development. To align with sustainable development objectives, UDB definitions have evolved to reconcile urban development with ecological preservation. This study presents a UDB delineation framework from an integrated perspective that incorporates both demand-oriented and comprehensive constraints. Specifically, the urban construction land demand area was estimated based on population projections, meanwhile, the ecological red line (ERL) was delineated and integrated into the evaluation of the construction land suitability. Subsequently, with the demand area as the simulation target and unsuitable areas as comprehensive constraints, the UDB was delineated by simulating future land use patterns. The proposed framework was applied to Wuhan, a rapidly urbanizing city in central China, where the delineation of the UDB serves the dual purpose of managing the rapid expansion of built-up land and achieving a harmonious balance between urban development imperatives and ecological protection goals. Moreover, based on the results and analysis, policy implications for the rational spatial planning of Wuhan were proposed, encompassing the spatial patterns and scientific decision-making in ecological conservation and urban development. The results demonstrate that the efficacy of adopting a comprehensive perspective in delineating UDB effectively reconciles the competing needs of urban development and conservation. The framework and the policy insights derived in this study could inform spatial planning efforts not only in Wuhan but also in other cities facing the dilemma of urban development and ecological protection.","Song, Xiangxiang","Zhang, Zuo","Wang, Zhe","Liu, Yanzhong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES,urban development boundary (UDB),ecological red line (ERL),urban land suitability,land use simulation,integrated framework,spatial decision-making,GROWTH BOUNDARIES,ECOLOGICAL SENSITIVITY,ECOSYSTEM SERVICES,LAND,URBANIZATION,CONSTRUCTION,MODEL,SIMULATION,SHANGHAI,PATTERNS,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2024,Development vs. conservation in limited urban sprawl: An integrated framework for resolving the urban boundary dilemma in China
Row_9,"Increasing population caused by migration from rural to urban leads the cities, whose ownership is primarily public, to spread over forest areas and agricultural lands in their periphery. Today, simulation models created by geospatial data mining (GDM) techniques are frequently used to model the effects of uncontrolled urban sprawl on land use/land cover (LULC) changes. However, most of these models have yet to consider the impact of ownership diversities. The study's main purpose is to investigate the interactions and interdependencies between Spatiotemporal LULC changes and private land ownership and monitor the precipitous urban sprawl through simulation models created by GDM techniques. In this context, the Sancaktepe district of Istanbul, where the population growth is rapid and the LULC change is very excessive, was chosen as the study area. CORINE LULC data for 1990, 2000, and 2018 were used in the study. Two hybrid prediction models were produced for 2040 by integrating multi-layer perception (MLP) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms with Markov Chains (MC) method. A base model was prepared with the intersection of these two to take protection precautions in the short and medium term. According to the results, it was determined by MLP that private land ownership significantly affects LULC. In addition, the pressure of urbanization on forests and agricultural lands, most of which are publicly owned, increases, and urban sprawl causes informal settlement.","Ayazli, Ismail Ercument",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,LAND USE POLICY,Land use/land cover change,Informal settlement,Geospatial data mining,Urban geosimulation,Urban sprawl,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK,CELLULAR-AUTOMATA MODELS,URBAN-GROWTH SIMULATION,MARKOV-CHAIN,PATH DEPENDENCE,SPRAWL,DRIVEN,AREAS,SCALE,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2024,Investigating the interactions between spatiotemporal land use/land cover dynamics and private land ownership
Row_10,"Existing research on urban dynamic simulations has primarily focused on horizontal aspects, whereas vertical changes have remained relatively unexplored. Although a few preliminary studies have attempted to simulate three-dimensional (3D) urban dynamics, these have generally amounted to rudimentary amalgamations of horizontal urban expansion simulation and vertical height estimation. In this study, we enhanced our original Future Land Use Simulation (FLUS) model into a 3D version (FLUS-3D) to simulate the continuous 3D dynamics of real -world urban development. A distinctive characteristic of the proposed model is its ability to concurrently update 3D information of the developed land grids during the simulation process. The FLUS-3D model was assessed via simulations across three metropolitan regions in China: the Beijing -Tianjin -Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, and Pearl River Delta regions. Satisfactory simulation performances were found across all regions, with Figure of Merit values ranging 0.21 -0.35 for horizontal expansion, overall accuracy values of 83 % for the refinement of urban functional types, and root mean squared error values of 5 -7 m for built-up height simulations. Comparative experiments further demonstrated a significant outperformance of the FLUS-3D model compared to that of existing models. Subsequently, the proposed model was applied to simulate the future evolution of 3D urban dynamics until 2030 under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). The simulation results effectively illustrated the influence of each SSPs on 3D urban development. Given that 3D urban structures are fundamental parameters in urban climate modeling, the proposed model can potentially be used in urban -related studies climate change mitigation to achieve future urban sustainability.","Xu, Xiaocong","Ding, Dan","Liu, Xiaoping",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,Cellular automata,Urban development,Three-dimensional simulation,FLUS model,CELLULAR-AUTOMATA,SPATIAL DYNAMICS,NEURAL-NETWORK,EXPANSION,CHINA,MAPS,CALIBRATION,SCENARIOS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,A three-dimensional future land use simulation (FLUS-3D) model for simulating the 3D urban dynamics under the shared socio-economic pathways
Row_11,"Vector cellular automata (VCA) models, which excel at representing spatiotemporal dynamics of irregularly shaped land parcels, have been widely employed in land use change simulations. However, current research faces the following issues: (1) most VCA models neglect the spatial heterogeneity of driving factors within each land parcel when evaluating the environmental driving effects; (2) when calculating the neighborhood effects, simple statistics of land use types in neighboring parcels are often used, overlooking the influence of driving factors within neighboring parcels; (3) the ability to explore the interactions between land parcels is often limited. To address the aforementioned issues, this study proposes a HashGAT-VCA model for investigating urban land use changes. The model utilizes a Hash function to encode the non-uniform distribution of each driving factor within each irregularly shaped land parcel into a fixed-length vector, and constructs a graph structure between land parcels based on their spatial topological relationships. By employing a Graph Attention Network (GAT), the model explores the mechanisms of environmental driving effects and inter-parcel interactions to calculate the probability of land use change for each parcel. The proposed HashGAT-VCA model was applied to simulate urban land use changes in Shenzhen, China, from 2009 to 2012. Compared to other VCA models, the HashGAT-VCA demonstrated higher simulation accuracy. The results indicated that HashGAT-VCA can effectively capture the impacts of the heterogeneously distributed driving factors and the interactions between land parcels on land use changes. Additionally, this study simulated land use patterns for the years 2025 and 2030 under ecological control strategies, providing decision support for urban planning.","Guan, Qingfeng","Li, Jianfeng","Zhai, Yaqian","Liang, Xun","Yao, Yao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,Vector Cellular Automata,Graph Attention Network,Hash function,Land use change simulation,Spatial interaction,NEURAL-NETWORK,USE DYNAMICS,GROWTH,COVER,EXPANSION,SCALE,CITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,HashGAT-VCA: A vector cellular automata model with hash function and graph attention network for urban land-use change simulation
Row_12,"This study aims to assess the performance of Weather Research and Forecasting coupled with the urban canopy model and anthropogenic heat (AH) on extreme heat events and determine the potential effect of urbanization on these extreme heat events in Metro Manila. Simulations with well-represented urban land use capture temperature (Mean Bias is -0.39 degrees C), especially during nighttime compared to simulations without urban land cover. The simulations with urban areas at night show an increase in sensible (-75 W m-2) and ground heat fluxes (-125 W m-2), while a decrease in latent heat flux (-13 W m- 2) compared to simulations without urban areas. Simulations with urban cover have temperatures more than 4 degrees C in central Metro Manila than simulations with no urban grids. Sensitivity tests with three different planetary boundary layer (PBL) and radiation schemes show that ACM2 performed best, while RRTMG captured distribution. During the heatwaves, the daytime and nocturnal urban heat island intensities (UHIIs) are estimated at 0.75 degrees C and 2.17 degrees C, respectively.

Row_13,"With climate change and urbanization, flood disasters have significantly affected urban development worldwide. In this study, we developed a paradigm to assess flood economic vulnerability and risk at the urban mesoscale, focusing on urban land use. A hydrological simulation was used to evaluate flood hazards through inundation analyses, and a hazard-vulnerability matrix was applied to assess flood risk, enhancing the economic vulnerability assessment by quantifying the differing economic value and flood losses associated with different land types. The case study of Wangchengpo, Changsha, China, found average total economic losses of 126.94 USD/ m2, with the highest risk in the settlement core. Residential areas had the highest flood hazard, vulnerability, and losses (61.10% of the total loss); transportation areas accounted for 27.87% of the total economic losses due to their high flooding depth. Despite low inundation, industrial land showed greater economic vulnerability due to higher overall economic value (10.52% of the total). Our findings highlight the influence of land types and industry differences on flood vulnerability and the effectiveness of land-use inclusion in urban-mesoscale analyses of spatial flood characteristics.

Row_14,"An accurate grasp of urban expansion patterns is conducive to efficient urban management and planning. Various urban growth models have been developed to meet this need in the last two decades. As more models become available, users increasingly face the challenge of choosing the right one for their purposes. In this study, we first reviewed the recent usage pattern of urban growth models (UGMs) and identified the top ten UGMs accounting for 73.3% of total usage from 2000 to 2021. We then compared the performance of six commonly used UGMs in simulating urban expansion, including the Cellular Automata-Markov model (CA-Markov), Slope, land use, excluded layer, urban extent, transportation, hillshade (SLEUTH), Conversion of Land Use and its Effects at Small extent model (CLUE-S), Future land use simulation model (FLUS), Land Use Scenario Dynamics model (LUSD), and Land Change Modeler (LCM). The behaviors of the six models were verified against descriptions in the model's documentation. We also analyzed the models' documentation, focusing on data requirements and the user's flexibility in the modeling process. The results showed that the validation accuracies of the models varied with the inputted data, indicating a model does not have an intrinsic accuracy. CA-Markov, FLUS, LUSD, and LCM could be verified, while CLUE-S and SLEUTH failed to meet some verification criteria. In addition, SLEUTH has the highest requirement for input data among all studied models. FLUS and LCM allow for higher user flexibility in modeling than others.

The CA-MCE-Markov model was applied to design and simulate land use changes in natural development, economic development priority and internal enhancement scenarios in Aksu in 2030. PSR model was used to evaluate land ecological security levels quantitatively. In terms of area change, simulation indicated that cultivated land will decrease by 774 square kilometers, urban and rural construction land will increase by 100 square kilometers in an internal enhancement scenario, to achieve intensive development. Natural development and economic development priority scenarios will increase cultivated land by 3436 km2, urban and rural construction land by 386 km2. In terms of spatial change, inversion positions of cultivated land, forest land and water area in natural development scenario are inconsistent with reality, layout of urban and rural construction land in economic development priority scenario is rough, layout of urban and rural construction land in internal enhancement scenario is reasonable. If development status continues over the years, level of ecological security will continue to decrease. If economic development is given priority, safety pressure and bearing capacity response are still serious problems. In contrast, ecological security level of internal enhancement scenario will be greatly improved, which is the optimal simulation scheme and high ecological security. By evaluating multi-scenario land use changes, we provide measures and methods to solve actual conflicts, seek sustainable development, and improve ecological environment.

This study aimed to identify the spatial and temporal patterns of ecosystem service bundles (ESB) in the Beibu Gulf urban agglomeration from 2000 to 2030, analyze the trajectory of ESB evolution, and elucidate the drivers behind ESB formation and evolution. We utilized the Patch-generating Land Use Simulation (PLUS) model to establish baseline (BLS), carbon sequestration priority (CPS), and urbanization priority (UPS) scenarios for simulating land use patterns in 2030. Following the assessment of ecosystem service values (ESV) through the equivalent factor method, we identified the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of ESB using the K-means clustering algorithm. By employing stability mapping and landscape indices, we identified and analyzed various types of ESB evolutionary trajectories. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was employed to pinpoint the drivers of ESB formation and evolution. The results revealed that from 2000 to 2030, land use changes were primarily observed in cropland, forestland, and construction land. Between 2000 and 2020, 92.88% of the region did not experience shifts in ESB types. In UPS, the ESB pattern in the study area underwent significant changes, with only 76.68% of the region exhibiting stabilized trajectories, while the other two scenarios recorded percentages higher than 80%. Key drivers of ESB-type shifts included initial food provision services, elevation, slope, changes in the proportion of construction land, and population change.

To address this issue, this study applied a VCA model and two raster-based models, i.e., a pixel-based CA model and a patch-based CA model, to simulate and compare their performance in simulating land cover changes. The results show that VCA and patch-based CA were superior, with VCA's FoM being 39.74% higher than pixel-based CA and 11.00% over patch-based CA. VCA effectively tracks construction land expansion in rapidly developing areas, while patch-based CA excels in central urban and suburban shifts, fitting broader study scopes. Additionally, a spatial scale sensitivity analysis of the VCA model revealed that a smaller VCA cell size improves accuracy but introduces a risk of spatial pattern errors. Notably, the scope of study impacts VCA accuracy more than cell size. These findings bolster land cover change modeling theory and offer insights for precise future land cover change simulations and decision-making.","Yao, Yao","Jiang, Ying","Sun, Zhenhui","Li, Linlong","Chen, Dongsheng","Xiong, Kailu","Dong, Anning","Cheng, Tao","Zhang, Haoyan","Liang, Xun","Guan, Qingfeng",,,,,,,,7,COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS,Land cover change,Spatial scale sensitivity,Cellular automata models,Vector -based cellular automata,Regional variations,URBAN-GROWTH,SIMULATION,SCALE,EXPANSION,DYNAMICS,IMPACT,AREAS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,APR 2024,Applicability and sensitivity analysis of vector cellular automata model for land cover change
Row_19,"Land-use and land-cover change (LUCC) simulations are powerful tools for evaluating and predicting future landscape dynamics amid rapid human-nature interactions to support decision-making. However, existing models often overlook spatial heterogeneity and temporal dependencies when modeling LUCC at both the macro and microscales. In this paper, we propose a new model, a self-calibrated convolutional neural network-based cellular automata (SC-CNN-CA) model, which integrates macro- and microspatial characteristics to simulate complex interactions among land-use types. The SC-CNN-CA model incorporates a self-calibration module using Gaussian functions to capture macrotrend such as urban sprawl while accounting for microlevel land-use interactions such as neighborhood effects. The results indicated that (1) the neighborhood effect between agricultural land and urban land tended to ""increase followed by a decrease."" (2) Urban sprawl in Wuhan was highly compact, with a relatively high intensity of urban expansion at distances between 11.96 km and 24.44 km. (3) Compared with the other CA models tested, the SC-CNN-CA model demonstrated superior performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 84.12% and a figure of merit of 20.20%. This new model can enhance our understanding of historical LUCC trajectories and improve predictions of spatially explicit information for efficient land resource and urban management.","Li, Muchun","Li, Boyan","Feng, Qi","Wang, Yunchen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES,land-use change modeling,land-system behaviors,cellular automata,self-calibration,Wuhan,CELLULAR-AUTOMATA,URBAN-GROWTH,EXPANSION,MODEL,URBANIZATION,CONSTRUCTION,MECHANISMS,PREDICTION,FRAMEWORK,DYNAMICS,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,"A new approach to land-use simulation that integrates macro- and microspatial characteristics: A case study of Wuhan, China"

However, the differences in driving forces of urban land among cities were not fully considered in previous simulations. Here, we adopted a data-driven approach combined with Monte Carlo method to simulate future urban land quantity in China at the city scale under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). The results show that the total urban land area of China will reach 154,105 to 289,932 km2 by 2070 under different scenarios, 1.8 to 3.4 times that of 2020. Compared with the traditional methods at the national or regional scale, the clustering method used to classify urban land expansion types can better fit the urban land change of each city. Meanwhile, the iterative simuation of future urban land quantity can depict the slowing down trend of urban land expansion. This study provides the amount of urban land from 2020 to 2070 at the city scale, confirming a close relationship between urban development and selection of urbanization pathway. Choosing a more sustainable path of social and economic development is conducive to restraining the rapid expansion of urban land in China.

Row_24,"Interpretations of the urban cellular automata (CA) model aim to ensure that its predictive behaviors are consistent with real -world processes. Current urban CA interpretations have revealed the impacts of driving factors on land development suitability, or neighborhood effects and random perturbation on simulation results. However, three limitations remain unresolved: (1) the interpretations of deep learning (DL) -based urban CA are seldom integrated with the prerequired feature selection, (2) the input features from different urban CA modules are still explained by separate approaches, and (3) the interpretation results are rarely derived at the cell level to uncover spatially varying urban land development patterns. This study proposes a SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based urban CA interpretation framework to address these challenges and improve urban CA. This framework uses model-level SHAP importance to identify dominant features from different modules for constructing the final simulation model. Then, cell-level SHAP importance is used to uncover spatially varying driving forces of urban expansion. The framework's effectiveness is rigorously tested and confirmed using a convolution neural network CA (CNN -CA) model for Dongguan City. The experimental results demonstrate that (1) SHAP-based model interpretation improves feature selection for DL -based urban CA. The figure of merit for CNN -CA calibrated using SHAP-based important features improves by 3%, outperforming the tested baseline methods. (2) SHAP measures the impacts of each feature from different CA modules in a whole. In this case, physical factors are much more important at the model level than proximity and accessibility factors, while neighborhood effect is the second most crucial factor. (3) Cell-level SHAP interpretations uncover spatially different urban land development patterns. For example, due to the extensive industrial land development in the northern Songshan Lake Zone, in the CNN -CA model, proximity to major roads within this region is associated with positive SHAP-based contribution share on cell-level urban expansion.","Yang, Changlan","Guan, Xuefeng","Xu, Qingyang","Xing, Weiran","Chen, Xiaoyu","Chen, Jinguo","Jia, Peng",,,,,,,,,,,,3,COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS,Model interpretability,SHapley Additive exPlanations,Feature selection,Cellular automata,Convolution neural network,Urban growth simulation,LAND-USE-CHANGE,SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS,EXPANSION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2024,How can SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) interpretations improve deep learning based urban cellular automata model?
Row_25,"Detailed urban information, including land use/land cover (LULC), anthropogenic heat (AH) release, and urban canopy parameters (UCP), play critical roles in meteorological field simulations. It is particularly relevant for the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with the single-layer urban canopy model (SLUCM). Thus, we develop high-resolution LULC, AH, and UCP data sets for Nanjing, a megacity in China, and conduct a series of numerical experiments with WRF/SLUCM to evaluate the impacts of urban parameters on the urban thermal environment. Model simulations with LULC scenarios have good agreement with the observed 2-m temperature (T-2) with a correlation coefficient of around 0.85, and present strong spatial homogeneity due to the more realistic representation of urban categories. The LULC change directly decreases the surface wind speed and increases (decreases) the sensible (latent) heat flux (Q(sH) (Q(LH))) in urban areas during the daytime; meanwhile increases Q(sH) and releases ground heat storage (Q(GH)) during the nighttime, resulting in urban warming by 0.91 degrees C in urban areas, compared with the control simulation (CTL) that does not take into account urban surfaces. In the LULC experiments combined with the UCP or AH, the UCP change enhances Q(sH) and releases more Q(GH) during nighttime, which increases T-2 by 0.13 degrees C relative to LULC simulation. Also, the UCP effect reduces surface roughness and increases the width of the urban canopy, resulting in slightly enhanced wind speed, which is favorable for a warming environment in the urban area; the AH change contributes to increasing T-2 by 0.19 degrees C through directly enhancing Q(sH) relative to LULC simulation. AH combined with the UCP further strengthens the UCP effect in the urban area. Overall, the influence of urban parameters on the T-2 is more pronounced during nighttime than daytime, which presents a decreasing trend with an increase in wind speed and spatial humidity in the urban area.","Wang, Jie","Miao, Shiguang","Doan, Quang-Van","Chen, Fei","Abolafia-Rosenzweig, Ronnie","Yang, Long","Zhang, Guwei","Zhang, Yizhou","Dou, Jingjing","Xu, Youpeng",,,,,,,,,8,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES,urbanization,urban thermal environment,land use,land cover,anthropogenic heat,urban canopy parameters,HEAT-ISLAND INTENSITY,CANOPY MODEL,WRF MODEL,SURFACE,CLIMATE,SIMULATION,PARAMETERS,SUMMER,LAYER,URBANIZATION,,,,,,,,,,MAR 27 2023,Quantifying the Impacts of High-Resolution Urban Information on the Urban Thermal Environment

Identifying interactions between UHIs and multiple land use components is a crucial step to obtain human heat welfare information. However, few studies have predicted sub cell scale land use structure dynamics on UHIs due to the lack of subpixel simulation methods. Herein, we present an integrated framework coupling subpixel unmixing and mixed-cell simulation methods to predict fine-scale land-use structural changes. A widely used XGBoost was used to determine the optimal scale for future UHIs prediction. This framework explores how multiscale changes in land use structure will affect future UHIs intensity, taking Wuhan, China as a study area. The results reveal that most influence comes from the scale below the 330-m grid, while the fine-scale land use components of a given position show limited impact on the UHI intensity. Impervious surfaces contribute more than 55% of the importance, while bare soil and water components within the 270-m grid also significantly affect UHIs.

This study focuses on seven districts in Seoul City that have been rapidly urbanized since the 1970 s, aiming to qualify and project the impact of urbanization on biodiversity through the response of habitat quality (HQ) values to historical changes in urban forests. We first simulated historical transformations using high-precision land use and land cover (LULC) data in 1972, 2000, and 2015. Then we projected changes in LULC up to 2030 using the Land Change Modeler. The HQ value of urban forests from 1972 to 2030 was quantified using the InVEST model.

Row_28,"Effective urban land-use re-planning and the strategic arrangement of drainage pipe networks can significantly enhance urban flood defense capacity. Aimed at reducing the potential risks of urban flooding, this paper presents a straightforward and efficient approach to an urban distributed runoff model (UDRM). The model is developed to quantify the discharge and water depth within urban drainage pipe networks under varying rainfall intensities and land-use scenarios. The Nash efficiency coefficient of UDRM exceeds 0.9, which indicates its high computational efficiency and potential benefit in predicting urban flooding. The prediction of drainage conditions under both current and re-planned land-use types is achieved by adopting different flood recurrence intervals. The findings reveal that the re-planned land-use strategies could effectively diminish flood risk upstream of the drainage pipe network across 20-year and 50-year flood recurrence intervals. However, in the case of extreme rainfall events (a 100-year flood recurrence), the re-planned land-use approach fell short of fulfilling the requirements necessary for flood disaster mitigation. In these instances, the adoption of larger-diameter drainage pipes becomes an essential requisite to satisfy drainage needs. Accordingly, the proposed UDRM effectively combines land-use information with pipeline data to give practical suggestions for pipeline modification and land-use optimization to combat urban floods. Therefore, this methodology warrants further promotion in the field of urban re-planning.","Zhou, Yang","Leng, Yi-ling","Wang, Peng-yu","Zhang, Shang-hong","Zhu, Yu-long","Yi, Yu-jun",,,,,,,,,,,,,11,JOURNAL OF HYDRODYNAMICS,Stormwater runoff,water depth,urban distributed runoff model,urban drainage pipe networks,urban land-use re-planning,HYDROGRAPH,SIMULATION,SURFACE,IMPACT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2024,Effectiveness of urban distributed runoff model for discharge and water depth calculation in urban drainage pipe networks
Row_29,"An emphasis on whether the modeled response of rainfall to urban signature is consistent across different boundary forcings is lacking. Here, using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, we compare urban impacts in the boundary-dependent simulations of a record-breaking rainfall event in Istanbul, designing urban and nourban land cover scenarios. The data used for the boundaries are ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) and NCEP Final Analysis (FNL), and we perform simulations with variable boundary and parameterization configurations and use their ensemble mean in our analysis. Our results highlight that some aspects of the urban impact on rainfall produced by different boundary conditions resemble each other. First, hourly rainfall intensifies over and upwind part of the urban domain independent of the employed boundary forcing. Especially within the urban borders, the boost in rainfall amounts during the investigation period totals 6% and 21% for the simulations forced with ERA5 and FNL, respectively. In addition, our simulations exhibit urban signals not only in the rainfall amounts but also in their timing and concentration. This signal in timing is evident by the urban rainfall system that moves slightly ahead of its nourban counterpart at each analyzed hour. We, in particular, observe a spatially less concentrated rainfall pattern as the system positions over the urban area and point out a potential urbanization-topography interaction. We further support these findings with cross-section and integrated water vapor transport analyses. By contrast, the main dissimilarities between the simulations forced with different boundary data include rainfall changes downwind of the city center. This behavior is commensurate with the increase in the temperature and sensible-heat flux values that are not similar in strength in the simulations forced with ERA5 and FNL. These findings suggest that different boundary data can promote similar urban impacts only to some extent, underlining the importance of considering their regional performance before using them in modeling studies.","Donmez, Kutay","Donmez, Berkay","Diren-Ustun, Deniz H.","Unal, Yurdanur",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH,Urbanization impact,Extreme precipitation,Boundary condition uncertainty,WRF modeling,Ensemble study,Istanbul,WATER-VAPOR TRANSPORT,EXTREME PRECIPITATION,WRF MODEL,CLIMATE,URBANIZATION,SIMULATION,EVENT,PERFORMANCE,REANALYSES,SCHEMES,,,,,,,,,,MAY 1 2023,"Boundary-dependent urban impacts on timing, pattern, and magnitude of heavy rainfall in Istanbul"

The temporal dimension has the potential to improve the performance of VCA further. However, it is challenging to precisely capture long sequence information of cadastral plot temporal data for VCA while ensuring accurate capture of fine granularity information simultaneously.

Applying Shenzhen's annual cadastral plot data from 2009 to 2014, this study shows how deep learning techniques can elucidate the temporal aspects of VCA models. Temporal-VCA notably improves precision by up to 22.12 %, outperforming the regular VCA models and traditional raster CA models. It reveals the complex nonlinear temporal patterns within cadastral-scale urban development processes.

However, the effectiveness of UGBs in different types of Chinese cities, particularly those on flatlands versus mountains, has not been studied. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of UGBs in a city on flatlands (Chengdu, China) and a mountainous city (Chongqing, China). We used a deep learning architecture (U-Net) to project urban expansions in 2035 with the presence/absence of UGBs and landscape metrics to evaluate UGBs' effectiveness in mitigating urban sprawl. We found significant differences in historical urban expansion between Chengdu and Chongqing from 1992 to 2019. Chengdu experienced spillover sprawl under a monocentric-dominated urban form, while Chongqing witnessed leapfrog and piece-mall sprawl under a polycentric form. Despite the differences in UGBs designation, the simulations demonstrated that UGBs could mitigate urban sprawl in both cities in 2035, with Chengdu exhibiting more pronounced effectiveness. Notably, UGBs were more effective in controlling spillover sprawl in Chengdu, whereas they could effectively reduce leapfrog sprawl in Chongqing. However, UGBs were constrained by strict top-down land quotas, limiting their potential.

However, few studies have focused on the balance of carbon emission reduction and economic goals in spatial planning, and the governance influence on land use change simulation. This study addresses this gap by conducting an empirical analysis in the rapidly urbanizing area of Hangzhou, China, taking into consideration low-carbon constraints and economic development demands. Using the stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology (STRIPAT) model and linear programming-Markov, we simulate the governance decision-making process to calculate the optimal land-use structures under both low-carbon and baseline scenario, then simulated land use patterns by using artificial-neural-network-based cellular automata (ANN-CA). The results showed 12.35% and 2.5% growth in urban and forest land, and 9.69% and 6.4% decline in farm and rural land under the low-carbon scenario. 92.31% of urban land change occur in the downtown districts and suburbs; while 59.77% of farm land change and 95.53% of forest land change occur in the exurban districts. The low-carbon performance of land use was reflected in carbon storage release, carbon emission capability change, and low-carbon capability. The most common conversion of land use categories under the low-carbon scenario was between farm and forest land, and between rural and urban land, which resulted in less carbon storage release and carbon emissions compared with the baseline scenario. Furthermore, under the low-carbon scenario, the compactness of construction land increased by 2 x 10-5, while its fragmentation decreased by 0.0027.

This study investigated the impact of underlying surface parameters on meteorological fields and pollutant concentrations in the Greater Bay Area (GBA), China, during warm and cold season. Updated land surface parameters, namely land use type, leaf area index, vegetation fraction, albedo, and roughness length, were incorporated to improve simulations. The model showed 7%-14% improvements (in terms of the index of agreement) in wind speed simulations, whereas temperature and relative humidity were not sensitive to the adoption of updated parameters. Moreover, compared with the model with default parameters, the model with updated natural underlying surface parameters showed a 2-3 m/s reduction in cross-border wind speed during cold season in the GBA. The model also showed a 1-2 m/s increase in the wind speed in urban areas, owing to thermal contrast. During periods in which clean air came from the north, the reduced wind speed hindered ozone removal in the GBA. The use of updated underlying surface parameters enhanced the urban heat island effect by similar to 2 K and increased the wind speed over urban areas by similar to 2 m/s. The intensified urban heat island circulation generated strong updrafts and intensified sea breezes, promoting the penetration of sea breezes inland. Additionally, the intensified sea breeze and urban heat island circulation contributed to a similar to 10-ppb reduction in ozone concentrations. Hence, incorporating the latest land surface parameters improved the simulation of meteorological fields and influenced cross-border pollutant transportation.

Through an integrated analysis of satellite observations and regional model simulations, this study quantifies LULCC effect on summer temperature in old urban areas (existed in 2003), new urban areas (developed after 2003) and rural areas (non-urban areas) over Eastern China in 2003-2019. The results show that LULCC causes urban areas to become warmer, with the effect being more pronounced in new urban areas than in old urban areas. Air temperature (2 m, T2) and surface temperature (TSK) in new urban areas increase respectively by 1.69 degrees C and 3.40 degrees C, while in old urban areas, T2 (TSK) increases by 0.10 degrees C (0.13 degrees C). Significant vegetation degradation is observed in new urban areas, whereas vegetation restoration occurs in old urban areas in recent years as a result of urban renewal. In contrast, LULCC cools and greens rural areas, with a 0.02 degrees C (0.03 degrees C) decrease in T2 (TSK). Urbanization warming can spread to the suburbs, along with vegetation degradation. The analysis of surface energy budget reveals that the reduction in latent heat plays a dominant role in urban warming. Our study underscores that a much larger greenspace fraction and albedo management in urban areas are suggested as an inherent part of future LULCC policy to alleviate urban-rural temperature disparity.","Wang, Yanyu","Wang, Jun","Zhang, Huanxin","Janechek, Nathan","Wang, Yi","Zhou, Meng","Shen, Pengke","Tan, Jianguo","He, Qianshan","Cheng, Tiantao","Huang, Cheng",,,,,,,,7,ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT,Urban warming,Vegetation degradation,Land use and land cover change,Atmospheric modeling,VEGETATION COVER,MODELING SYSTEM,LOWER REACHES,HEAT-ISLAND,URBANIZATION,MODIS,CLIMATE,VALIDATION,REGION,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 1 2023,Impact of land use change on the urban-rural temperature disparity in Eastern China
Row_38,"The suitability of agricultural lands is basic data for both sustainable agricultural planning and optimal orientation of future urbanization projects. Indeed, unplanned urban expansion leads to many social and ecological problems. The prediction of urban expansion will strongly help the decision makers and local authorities to create a suitable future urban planning while preserving the regional ecosystem and especially the agricultural lands. Using multitemporal satellite images acquired in 1997, 2001, and 2013 over the Mitidja plain in Algeria, the aim of this study is the analysis of the land use and land cover change (LULCC) spatio-temporal distributions from 1997 to 2013 to model and then predict the future LULCC in 2025. The cellular automata Markov chain model (CA-Markov) that we developed is used for LULCC prediction with a focus on urban sprawl and agricultural lands degradation over the Mitidja plain. Once calibrated and validated, the CA-Markov model generates land suitability maps that indicate the best locations for urban expansion while safekeeping the agricultural lands.

However, most scholars have always paid attention to the exploration of the driving mechanisms of the spontaneous process. While for the self-organized process, most simulations based on cellular automata (CA) simply abstract it as the clustering process between land use types, ignoring the important role of human behaviors in urban growth. This study presents a framework that integrates a size-adaptive strategy with the multi-agent system (MAS) to establish a neighborhood with stakeholders' interactions (NSI). We employed the CA with NSI (Nsi-CA) to simulate the urban growth of Wuhan from 2000 to 2020 and analyzed its performance. The findings indicate that Nsi-CA performs better than the commonly used CA models at both local and global scales, with an increase in global Figure of Merit (FoM) of about 11.5 %. Moreover, the effectiveness of parameters controlling stakeholders' interactions in the NSI was revealed through a sensitivity analysis. By setting different scenarios with these parameters, the future urban land patterns of Wuhan in 2035 were predicted and used to provide planning suggestions for its future development.","Zhang, Bin","Li, Xuecao","Wang, Haijun","He, Sanwei","Zeng, Haoran","Cao, Xiaoxu","Song, Youcheng","Tung, Chih-Lin","Hu, Shougeng",,,,,,,,,,3,CITIES,Urban growth,Self -organization,Cellular automata,Multi -agent system,Neighborhood,LAND-USE,SPATIAL SCALE,SIMULATION,SENSITIVITY,EXPANSION,AGENTS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2024,Modeling self-organized urban growth by incorporating stakeholders' interactions into the neighborhood of cellular automata

Row_42,"Central Chile's Concon City urbanization trend has severely affected local hydrological processes. This research hypothesizes that switching to sustainable land-use/land-cover (LULC) in three Concon watersheds reduces the severity of their corresponding hydrological responses. High sustainability LULC zones would decrease runoff and enhance interception and infiltration, generating hydrograph curves with extended lag time and moderate peak flows. The Hydrological Simulation Program FORTRAN (HSPF) is used for simulating watershed processes. Decreases in peak flows of 31.1%, 19.8%, and 54.5%, were estimated. Therefore, sustainable LULC reduces the severity of the hydrological responses, benefiting storm water management. Real-world applications in Europe and the USA achieved comparable results. Urban master plans in Chile have favored the alteration of natural landscapes (anthropization). Per national regulations, changes to urban plans can be made every ten years.

Row_43,"The uncertainty in the generation and formation of non-point source pollution makes it challenging to monitor and control this type of pollution. The SWAT model is frequently used to simulate non-point source pollution in watersheds and is mainly applied to natural watersheds that are less affected by human activities. This study focuses on the Duliujian River Basin (Xiqing section), which is characterized by a dense population and rapid urbanization. Based on the calibrated SWAT model, this study analyzed the effects of land use change on non-point source pollution both temporally and spatially. It was found that nitrogen and phosphorus non-point source pollution load losses were closely related to land use type, with agricultural land and high-density urban land (including rural settlements) being the main contributors to riverine nitrogen and phosphorus pollution. This indicates the necessity of analyzing the impact of land use changes on non-point source pollution loads by identifying critical source areas and altering the land use types that contribute heavily to pollution in these areas. The simulation results of land use type changes in these critical source areas showed that the reduction effect on non-point source pollution load is in the order of forest land > grassland > low-density residential area. To effectively curb surface source pollution in the study area, strategies such as modifying urban land use types, increasing vegetation cover and ground infiltration rate, and strictly controlling the discharge of domestic waste and sewage from urban areas can be implemented.","Jia, Xinming","Zhang, Yu","Afrane, Sandylove","Chen, Jian Lin","Yang, Pingjian","Mao, Guozhu",,,,,,,,,,,,,1,ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH,Artificial rivers,Temporal and spatial perspectives,High pollution contribution,Pollution control simulation,ASSESSMENT-TOOL SWAT,CRITICAL SOURCE AREAS,SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION,WATER-QUALITY,UPPER REACH,MODEL,SOIL,MANAGEMENT,PHOSPHORUS,NITROGEN,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2024,Simulating the land use change effects on non-point source pollution in the Duliujian River Basin

This study develops an Urban Commuting Model (UCM) that integrates both spatial and temporal aspects: Spatially, changes in employment or population distribution lead to changes in commuting patterns; Temporally, the commuting patterns of the previous year form the basis for the patterns of the following year. The UCM, based on historical commuting matrix, simulates urban traffic demands under various scenarios of urban residential population and employment planning. In a case study, the proposed model was used to simulate urban traffic demands in Beijing under the construction scenario of the city's sub-center in Tongzhou.

Row_45,"In the context of global advocacy of sustainable development, China is striving to reach a peak in CO2 emission before 2030. Land use change is closely related to carbon emissions and forest stock volume. Thus, it is necessary to balance and optimize land use under different development scenarios before carbon emission peaks. To achieve peaking in carbon emissions, Fujian is crucial because forest coverage rate there is the highest in all of China. But Fujian is also necessary for China's economic growth. Future land use changes in Fujian are affected by a trade-off between carbon-peaking actions and economic development. Here CLUMondo model is used to explore optimal land use allocation under 3 scenarios: 1) ecological target scenario (maximizing ecological benefits, the forest stock volume is not lower than the target value), 2) economic target scenario (satisfying the land use status in 2030 under the economic development target, the forest area is not degraded) and 3) conventional coordinated target scenario (ecological and economic goals are developed steadily according to the current situation). The CLUMondo model is found suitable for land use/land cover change simulation in Fujian province. To achieve economic development while maintaining existing forest area as much as possible in the future, Fujian province needs to improve forest management level, forest quality, forest ecological benefit compensation system. Fujian province should optimize urban development pattern and strengthen intensive development of urban, ecological functional areas.

Row_46,"Land use change occurs by altering natural landscape to manmade built environment. Rapid urban growth is the main factor for land use change at global level. Addis Ababa is one of the recent rapidly growing urban areas in Africa. Since 1983, the population has increased by nearly three times. However, the spatial expansion of the urban area has been much greater with urban sprawl, informal settlement, industry, condominium housing, and real estate development. The demand for urban land has been increasing at alarming rate both by city government, investors, and its residents. The city is primate and the population nine times the second largest city in the country. This study focused on quantifying and analyzing impact assessment of urban growth on land use change from 1986 to 2019. The study assessed the major change in extent and determinants of land use change through 33 years (1986-2019) and future growth scenario the next 30 years from 2019 to 2049. This study used Landsat image, base map of 1986, 1998, 2008, and 2019, to analyze built-up growth and land use change. Observation and interview have also taken to explore more on major urban growth and land use change driving factor from concerned bodies. The last, land use efficiency method was applied to measure land consumption rate and population growth rate. The result showed that in 1986, 1998, 2008, and 2019, built-up covered 21.83%, 42.31%, 59.42%, and 81.20% respectively. This shows that the agriculture and open space were rapidly changed to built-up by 32,486.67 hectares for housing, manufacturing, and infrastructure development. The result from concerned bodies has portrayed that the key determinants for urban land use change in the city were population growth at 4.2% per annum. Government led condominium housing, real estate development, and industrial development expansion including informal settlement has been rapidly reducing agriculture and open space through time. Therefore, unconventional planning approach could be exercised based on community interest for affordable high-rise building.

To address this, lateral terrestrial water flow schemes has been developed for Noah-MP on both natural and urban land surfaces to improve the simulation of soil moisture. These schemes have enabled the conversion of Noah-MP to a three-dimensional land surface model (Noah-MP-3D).

Cellular automata, such as the widely used patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model, ensure reliable accuracy in urban growth simulations. However, previous studies have overlooked the development heterogeneity amongst sub-regions by treating the study area as the homogenous. Based on the PLUS model, this study introduces a new model coupling regional development heterogeneity and noise reduction (RDHNR-PLUS), which is an enhanced model that incorporates relative development coefficients derived from nighttime light data to capture regional heterogeneity. It also employs noise reduction techniques inspired by image classification's small patch processing method. Results demonstrate that the relative development co-efficients effectively reveal the potential of different regions, while the noise reduction process mitigates simulation noise. The combined approach enhances overall accuracy, figure of merit, and structural similarity by 4.56 %, 20.44 %, and 5.06 %, respectively. Additionally, we simulate and analyse the built-up area of Zhengzhou from 2000 to 2030. The findings indicate rapid past growth, particularly in new urban areas, with projected future expansion likely to slow down.

Updated Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land use data and coupled with the urban canopy models (UCMs) in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. This enabled the impact of urban land expansion on meteorological conditions and ozone (O3) concentrations to be evaluated. Urban expansion increased the temperature at 2 m (T2) and the probability of precipitation in urban expansion areas, and enhanced the surface urban heat island at night. As the expansion areas became progressively larger, the increase in T2 became more pronounced. The proportions of urban surfaces in June 2016, 2018, and 2020 compared to 2001 increased by 0.69%, 0.83%, and 1.04%, respectively, while T2 increased by 0.12, 0.19, and 0.20 degrees C in urban areas, respectively. With urban expansion, the O3 concentration increased by 1.12, 1.37, and 0.76 mu g/m3 (three-year averages) in urban, suburban, and rural areas, respectively. After coupling a multi-layer urban canopy model (building effect parameterization, BEP), or a multi-layer urban canopy model with a building energy model including anthropogenic heat due to air conditioning (BEP + BEM, abbreviated as BEM simulation), the O3 concentration changed significantly in the urban expansion area, compared to the results of a single-layer urban canopy model (UCM). O3 concentrations decreased most in the BEP simulation (-0.77 mu g/m3), while O3 concentrations increased most in the BEM simulation (+1.85 mu g/m3). The average observed O3 concentration was 108.35 mu g/m3 (three-year average), while the simulated value was 75.65-83.72 mu g/m3 (R = 0.69-0.77).

This work aims to refine the temporal LSM considering spatiotemporal land use and land cover (LULC) and to provide decision makers with governing factors in landslides control during urbanization in mountainous areas. Herein, annual LULC data and landslide inventory spanning from 1992 to 2022 were utilized to map dynamic landslide susceptibility in Wanzhou District of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, China. Initially, the landslide-related factors were filtered as input features of random forest (RF) model before diagnosis via multicollinearity test and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC). The advanced patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model was then invited to fuel temporal susceptibility prediction powered by LULCC projections. Finally, the performance of various scenarios was evaluated using Receiver Characteristic Curve (ROC) curves and Shapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) technique, with discussions on LULCC temporal adjacency thresholds and mutual feedback mechanism between territorial exploitation and landslide occurrences. The results indicate that the precision of LSM is positively correlated with the time horizon, acted by incorporating the latest LULC and LULCC achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.920. The transition of land from forest to cropland and impervious areas should be avoided to minimize the increase in landslide susceptibility. Moreover, a one-year adjacency threshold of LULCC is recommended for optimal model accuracy in future LSM.

However, many traditional cultural landscapes worldwide are currently undergoing rapid urbanization. In decision-making concerning sustainable urbanization, tradeoffs frequently occur between different objectives (i.e., between multiple ES) and between different pathways or urbanization strategies (e.g., following modern zoning principles or traditional landscape structures). This study aims to examine the dynamics and interactions between multiple ES under different strategies for the urbanization of cultural landscapes. A case study was conducted in Nansha, China. Three scenarios-business-as-usual, zoning plan-based, and traditional landscape structure-based-were developed to reflect the most common urbanization strategies, each parameterized with identical land-use quantities. Land-use change from 2020 to 2035 under different scenarios was simulated using the PLUS model (integrated Random Forest and Cellular Automata models). The traditional landscape structure-based scenario used the settlement pattern before urbanization to predict the chances of future urban areas' occurrence. Eleven ES indicators were used to examine ES dynamics and interactions in the simulation outcomes. The results showed that the amount of ES provided by the landscape declined and significant tradeoffs occurred between cultural and non-cultural ES. The business-as-usual scenario resulted in the greatest decrease in ES. The zoning plan -based scenario did not offer a significant improvement over the business-as-usual scenario. The traditional landscape structure-based scenario was the most effective in limiting ES decline, which also mitigated the tradeoff between urban development and flood regulation and fostered synergy between urban efficiency and ecotourism opportunity.

Row_57,"Assessment of development plans particularly in terms of land use and land cover can strategically support conventional land use planning practices. This paper attempts to assess the land cover related proposals mentioned in the development plans of two small urban areas, namely Madaripur and Rajoir of Bangladesh, which are rapidly growing and facing shrinkage of agricultural lands and water bodies by such growth. Land cover data for the study have been extracted from Landsat satellite images of 1995, 2005 and 2015. The classified satellite data have been employed in a Multi-Layer Perceptron Markov model to predict the land cover scenario of the study areas for 2035, the terminal year for the development plans. The proposed development plan and the modelpredicted land cover maps of 2035 are both quantitatively and spatially compared. The study also determines the degree of conformance and identifies the affected sites within respective protected areas. The analysis reveals significant mismatches between the development plans and the model predictions for the unconstrained simulation of the model, whereas fewer differences are observed in the case of guided simulation. The results imply that lack of implementation of the development plans may result in undesired land cover transformations. It recommends employing remote sensing and GIS-based models to support the land-use plan-making process in the development authorities.","Tanvir, Mohammad Ridwan","Haque, Afsana",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,APPLIED SPATIAL ANALYSIS AND POLICY,Development planning,Urban growth modelling,Assessment,Remote sensing,CELLULAR-AUTOMATA,NEURAL-NETWORKS,LAND,IMPLEMENTATION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2023,Assessment of Development Plans for Small Urban Areas of Bangladesh: Remote Sensing and GIS-based Approach
Row_58,"Agricultural land is a complex seminatural and semiartificial ecosystem that is affected by both human activities and natural factors. Clarifying land use and ecological health conflicts in agricultural areas is important for maintaining ecosystem services. Thus, taking the Henan section of the Yellow River (HSYR) as the study area, this study constructed an ecosystem service index (ESI) assessment model to explore the impact of land use change on ecosystem services from 1980 to 2020. Then, the future land use simulation (FLUS) model was used to simulate the effects of different development patterns on ecosystem services heterogeneity in 2035. The results showed that, from 1980 to 2000, the ESI increased from 0.520 to 0.649, but then decreased to 0.509 by the end of 2020 in the HSYR. In any simulation scenarios, urban land expansion continued to encroach on cropland, resulting in the loss of ecosystem services. Especially in the natural development scenario (ND), the ESI may be reduced by up to 2.55%. The results also emphasized that ecosystem services can be protected in the cropland protection scenario (EC). The results of this study enrich the understanding of the impact of human activities on ecological services in agricultural areas and provide new insights into grasping regional food security and ecological stability.","Jiang, Long","Wang, Zongzhi","Zuo, Qiting","Du, Huihua",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,34,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,Ecosystem services,Land use change,Scenario simulation,FLUS model,Agricultural production areas,URBANIZATION,MODEL,FLUS,CITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,APR 15 2023,Simulating the impact of land use change on ecosystem services in agricultural production areas with multiple scenarios considering ecosystem service richness
Row_59,"Understanding the intricate changes in land use and land cover (LULC) transformations, as well as accurately quantifying the ecosystem services value (ESV), holds paramount importance in achieving sustainable development goals. However, previous studies have notably neglected conducting empirical evaluations across various LULC prediction models under identical conditions within the same geographical region. Additionally, the majority of relevant studies primarily concentrate on local scales. In this study, we used CA-Markov, Future Land Use Simulation (FLUS) and Patch-generating Land Use Simulation (PLUS) models to simulate the dynamics of LULC, respectively. Subsequently, we successfully projected the future LULC patterns and corresponding ESV within the Harbin-Changchun Urban Agglomeration (HCUA), China. During the period spanning from 2000 to 2020, a persistent reduction of 2067 km2 in farmland was witnessed within the HCUA, while an accompanying expansion of 4081 km2 in built-up land occurred concurrently. The ESV in HCUA experienced a fluctuating trend. There was an initial decline of 7.443 x 109 yuan during the first decade, which was subsequently followed by an increase of 4.615 x 109 yuan during the latter decade. PLUS, FLUS, and CA-Markov models can all simulate the LULC of HCUA, but in decreasing order of accuracy and ease of use, with OA values of 0.8987, 0.8944 and 0.8651, and Kappa values of 0.8217, 0.8150 and 0.7860, respectively. The PLUS model was chosen to predict the future LULC. Then four development scenarios were set. Our optimization results indicate that it is advisable to restrict the area of built-up land within 17000 km2 in 2030. Moreover, under the economic and ecological balance (EEB) scenario, both ESV and economic benefits are projected to increase compared to the business as usual (BAU) scenario.

Row_60,"In Japan, shrinking densely built-up cities face the dual issue of lacking open spaces and increasing underutilized lands, such as vacant lots, lots with vacant houses, and parking lots. These unused land patches can be temporarily repurposed as open spaces for evacuation and recreation. However, identifying such clump is methodologically challenging. To address this issue, lot geometry is utilized. The study thus aims to investigate the frequency and size of contiguous underutilized lands, called the contiguity of underutilized lands, at a specific time point and under their temporary uses. A densely built-up area in Kobe city, Japan, was selected for the empirical case study. A comparison with simulation results shows that the observed static contiguity of underutilized lands tends to be more substantial than a uniformly random distribution. It shows a certain feasibility of a temporary use policy conducted in the case site. Specifically, when considering the temporary uses of underutilized lands, the maximum area of contiguous temporary open spaces is 583 m2, meeting the area requirement for a redevelopment project in Kobe. Utilizing parking lots can further extend the maximum area up to 945 m2. Nevertheless, policy makers need to promote the joint development of privately owned lots facing a wide roadway, as these are unlikely to become temporary open spaces. This study contributes not only to providing new methods for land use change simulation using lot geometry to analyse the contiguity of underutilized lands under their temporariness but also to demonstrating the feasibility and limitations of a temporary use policy.","Sayuda, Kanta","Usui, Hiroyuki","Asami, Yasushi","Hino, Kimihiro",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE,Urban shrinkage,vacant,lot,join analysis,temporary use,land use change,SHRINKING CITIES,SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION,POLICY RESPONSES,URBAN,CITY,VACANCY,SPACE,DEMOLITION,VEHICLES,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2024,Contiguity of underutilized lands: Dynamic simulation taking their temporary uses into account

Row_62,"Heatwaves are annually increasing in terms of intensity and frequency. In urban areas, the impact could be further exacerbated by the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. This work carries out an urban microclimate numerical analysis to evaluate the behavior of the UHI in the city of Turin (Italy) during a heatwave event. Turin is located in the North-West region of Italy, boarded by the Alps mountain ranges in the west and hills in the East. The study utilizes the WRF/MLUCM model and considers the heatwave period in June 2019. The high-resolution urban land use/land cover data is generated from local climate zone (LCZ) generator tool provided by the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) portal. The simulation is validated with the data provided by ARPA (Regional Environmental Protection Agency) meteorological stations located over the region. The lower root mean squared error of air temperature and higher index of the agreement show that the simulation is in good agreement with the observational data. The simulation results are then used to analyze the rural-urban temperature distributions over the diurnal cycle and local wind circulations. According to the simulated results, the city of Turin has higher near-surface UHI intensity during the night and early morning (with maximum intensity greater than 5 C), whereas the intensity is diminishing during the mid-day hours. The simulated wind patterns show a significant reduction in wind intensity over the urban areas. This reveals the potential of creating wind ventilation inside the city to minimize UHI effect and enhance air quality. Ultimately, this research contributes valuable insights into addressing the challenges posed by heatwaves and urban heat islands in Turin and offers a foundation for the development of sustainable urban climate strategies.","Pauly, Lippin","Canonico, Massimo","Ferrero, Enrico",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,URBAN CLIMATE,Urban heat island (UHI),Heatwaves,WRF/MLUCM,Urban microclimate,Local climate zone (LCZ),LAND-USE,PARAMETERIZATION,MITIGATION,MODELS,CITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 2024,Numerical investigation of thermal patterns and local wind circulations to characterize Urban Heat Island during a heatwave in Turin

It is therefore necessary to create or rehabilitate useful linkages between ecological spaces. Although ecosystem resilience is receiving increasing attention, most studies focus on the spatiotemporal changes of alternative indicators of ecosystem resilience, without considering the changes in the structure and function of internal ecological nodes. Therefore, this study presents a novel research framework that uses cascade failure model based on the ecological network (EN) to evaluate the resilience of typical urban areas. The framework combines ""importance-vulnerability"" scored ecological sources identification with minimum cumulative resistance simulation to quantitatively characterize the urban region as an EN and assesses the resilience of the urban EN using a capacity-load cascade failure model. The framework was tested in the Xi'an metropolitan region in China resulted in the regional EN with 191 nodes and 571 edges. It was found that the EN of the Xi'an metropolitan region was relatively stable. The network will completely break down only when the node failure rate exceeds 85 %.

Row_64,"Land use and land cover change (LUCC) modeling is crucial to urban planning and policy making. A well -used and effective paradigm for LUCC is the ANN -CA model which employs an artificial neural network (ANN) to calculate a transition probability over each land cell from various driving factors, and then uses a cellular automaton (CA) to evolve all cells consecutively to update their land usage and coverage according to the estimated probability distribution. This paper focuses on the effect of delays or perturbations possibly taking place between land cells on the LUCC modeling. To this end, a new ANN -CA model is proposed which adopts an asynchronous communicating cellular automaton (ACCA), rather than the conventional synchronous CA. Especially, the ACCA allows every cell to communicate with its neighbors independently at random times via a specific protocol, which offers a natural way to include stochastic delays in exchanging the current land usages between cells. As a result, every change of a cell's land use in the ACCA may not affect its neighbors immediately, but is subject to delays that might play an important role in modeling the practical LUCC. Numerical analysis of the new model are carried out over three regions of Chongqing city, China with different scales: Yongchuan District, Sanjiao Town, and Huangguashan Village, and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ANNACCA model can achieve a higher accuracy for LUCC simulation as compared to conventional ANN -CA models.","Lei, Qin","Jin, Hong","Lee, Jia","Zhong, Jiang",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE,Land use change,Cellular automaton,Asynchronous communication,Simulation,MODEL,SYSTEM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 21 2024,Land use and land cover change simulation enhanced by asynchronous communicating cellular automata

The findings demonstrate that overall, urban land green use efficiency (ULGUE) in the YREB has been ineffective; in terms of city scale, megacities have the highest efficiency, followed by large cities and small and medium-sized cities; and at the regional level, downstream efficiency does have the greatest average value, followed by upstream efficiency and middle efficiency. The results of temporal and spatial evolution reveal that the number of cities with a high ULGUE is increasing in general but that their spatial characteristics are relatively dispersed. Population density, environmental regulation, industrial structure, technology input, and the intensity of urban land investment all have major beneficial effects on ULGUE, whereas urban economic development level and urban land use scale clearly have inhibitory effects.

Therefore, this study develops a multiscale-multivariate prediction model for flood volume (FV) using wavelet transform, and a flood risk assessment model based on the joint distribution of FV and its key drivers using the Copula method. The downtown area of Zhengzhou City, a typical city in North China, is taken as the study area. The results reveal that land use change is the key driver for variation of urban rainstorm flood, and rapid urbanization led to the variation observed in 2005. The impact of land use change on FV primarily manifests at the long cycle scale, and the multiscale-multivariate prediction model demonstrates effective simulation (NSE = 0.957, R2 = 0.958, MAPE = 13.47%) and prediction capabilities (relative errors are all below 20%). Taking the FV exceeding the threshold corresponding to the frequency of 37.5% as an example, the maximum conditional risk probability under nine combinations of key drivers is 88.34%, while the minimum probability is only 6.83%, intuitively indicating the impact of rainstorm and urbanization on this risk.

Row_68,"Biophysical effects of land cover changes on land surface temperature (T-s), including two effects, that is, radiative effects (caused by surface albedo changes) versus non-radiative effects (caused by changes in the energy flux distribution), have attracted the attention of many researchers. However, the uncertainties of land use and land cover (LULC) and vegetation schemes on non-radiative effects, and the roles of non-radiative effects on T-s, remain uncertain. In this study, we investigate the local impact of LULC differences by comparing Noah with multiparameterization (Noah-MP) land model simulations with different LULC data sets and those with vegetation schemes whether they include interactive canopies. We attribute T-s changes induced by LULC differences obtained from Noah-MP simulations to radiative and non-radiative effects over East Asia based on the decomposed temperature metric theory. The results indicate that vegetation cools T-s over urban regions by 4.0-6.0?. Grassland and cropland decrease the T-s over barren regions. Forests are warmer (cooler) than grassland and cropland in high latitudes (in mid and low latitudes). Grassland is cooler than cropland. However, the magnitude of T-s changes induced by these differences is lower than that induced by differences between vegetation and urban. The non-radiative effect generally explains more than 50% of the local changes in T-s. The interactive canopies enlarge T-s changes for afforestation or replacements of urban region by vegetation. The effect of uncertainties in LULC data sets is negligible.

This study innovatively investigated the interactive feedback between UCL and RCL transition. First, a theoretical analytical framework was proposed. Second, a spatial simultaneous equation model (SSEM) was employed to examine the interactive feedback between UCL and RCL transitions in Jiangsu Province, China, from 2000 to 2020. The main findings were as follows: The interactive feedback between UCL and RCL transitions followed two paths. The first interactive feedback path was driven by the interaction of urban and rural factors, whereas the second was driven by the integrated management of urban and rural land. UCL and RCL transition witnessed a positive interactive feedback relation. Specifically, a 1% increase in UCL transition led to a 0.535% increase in RCL transition, and a 1% increase in RCL transition resulted in a 0.579% increase in UCL transition. The two aspects exhibited complex spatial interaction effects. The UCL transition in the subject city had positive and negative effects on the UCL and RCL transitions of neighboring cities, respectively. The RCL transition had positive effect on the RCL transition in neighboring cities.

In order to more precisely forecast and assess patterns of land use change, the study suggests a grey Markov land pattern analysis and prediction model that incorporates social aspects. The study builds a land pattern analysis and prediction model using a major city as the research object. The outcomes demonstrated the high accuracy and reliability of the grey Markov land pattern analysis and prediction model incorporating social factors, which can more accurately reflect and predict the land use pattern of the study area, with an average relative error of less than 0.01, an accuracy of more than 98%, and an overall fit that has increased by more than 3%. The overall pattern of change is very consistent with the reality. The model predicts that the main trend of future land use in the study area is the continued expansion of urban land such as industrial land, land for transport facilities and land for settlements, while non-construction land such as agricultural land and forest land will continue to decrease.

Row_75,"PurposeDespite the enormous need to succeed in the urban model, scientists and policymakers should work consistently to create blueprints to regulate urbanization. The absence of coordination between the crucial requirements and the regional strategies of the local authorities leads to a lack of conformance in urban development. The purpose of this paper is to address this issue.Design/methodology/approachThis study intends to manage future urban growth patterns using integrated methods and then employ the results in the genetic algorithm (GA) model to considerably improve growth behavior. Multi-temporal land-use datasets have been derived from remotely sensed images for the years 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020. Urban growth patterns and processes were then analyzed with land-use-and-land-cover dynamics. Results were examined for simulation and utilization of the GA.FindingsModel parameters were derived and evaluated, and a preliminary assessment of the effective coefficient in the formation of urbanization is analyzed, showing the city's urbanization pattern has followed along with the transportation infrastructure and outward growth, and the scattering rates are high, with an increase of 5.64% in building area associated with a decrease in agricultural lands and rangelands.Originality/valueThe research achieved a considerable improvement over the growth behavior. The conducted research design was the first of its type in that field to be executed to any specific growth pattern parameters in terms of regulating and policymaking. The method has integrated various artificial intelligence models to monitor, measure and optimize the projected growth by applying this design. Other research on the area was limited to projecting the future of Amman as it is an urbanized distressed city.","Al-Hadidi, Sajeda","Sweis, Ghaleb","Abu-Khader, Waleed","Abu-Rumman, Ghaida","Sweis, Rateb",,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT,Urbanization,LULC change,Urban management,Genetic algorithm,Growth optimization,Jordan,LAND-USE,URBAN-GROWTH,CELLULAR-AUTOMATA,NEURAL-NETWORK,CITIES,GIS,SIMULATION,AMMAN,CITY,OPTIMIZATION,,,,,,,,,,JUN 27 2024,Managing future urbanization growth patterns using genetic algorithm modeling
Row_76,"Due to higher levels of urbanization and increasing impermeable hard land covers, green spaces are decreasing, resulting in stormwater loss as surface runoff instead of being absorbed by soil and reintroduced into the water cycle. This study investigates the effect of land use ratios and land cover materials resulting from settlement design on surface runoff volume. The study was conducted using various scenarios in 9 settlements with different land use ratios, including roofs, sidewalks, parking areas, roadways, and green areas in Istanbul, a city with a high urbanization rate. Thus, surface runoff volume in settlements depending on the land use ratios was evaluated. A total of 336 material combinations were developed using various material alternatives in addition to different land use ratios. Therefore, the effect of different land cover materials used in the settlements on surface runoff volume was also evaluated. Study requirements were taken into consideration when choosing the calculation method, and the Rational Method, often preferred for calculating surface runoff volumes in small urban basins, was chosen. According to the calculation results obtained from the settlements developed for this study, surface runoff volume can be reduced by 37.10% by increasing only the green space ratio and by 67.65 % by using different material alternatives in the same settlement. Additionally, it was observed that each improvement made to reduce surface runoff in settlements resulted in a positive change.","Taskin, Halime Firdevs","Manioglu, Gulten",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,LAND USE POLICY,Urban Form,Land use,Land cover material,Surface runoff,Stormwater management,SENSITIVE URBAN DESIGN,SURFACE RUNOFF,SPONGE CITY,FLOOD RISK,MANAGEMENT,SIMULATION,REDUCTION,CATCHMENT,RECHARGE,FORMULA,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2024,Evaluation of the impact of land use ratios and cover materials in settlement design on stormwater runoff
Row_77,"The land surface temperature (LST) of urban is a key factor in the field of urban environmental monitoring, and thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing is an efficient method to obtain it. An important assumption of the traditional thermal radiance transfer model is that the land surface is flat, which has now proven difficult to hold under the urban landscape. Most of the existing urban thermal radiance transfer models have been developed for remote sensing images with a spatial resolution of tens of meters. Currently, airborne TIR sensors have the observation capability to acquire remote sensing images with an ultrahigh spatial resolution (1 cm-1 m), and the model needs to be improved. This letter proposed a new ultrahigh spatial resolution urban thermal radiance transfer model (UHURT) after analyzing the transfer processes within the urban canopy at ultrahigh spatial resolution. Various radiance components, the emitted radiance, reflected atmospheric downward radiance, and adjacent radiance, were modeled separately. The results of the traditional model and the UHURT model were compared with those of a ray-tracing computer simulation model, which showed that the new model successfully quantifies the multiple scattering and adjacent effects and obtained images closer to the computer simulation images. Besides, the LST retrieval of the computer-simulated images was performed using the traditional model and the UHURT model, and the proposed model successfully reduced the errors of the retrieval results and weakened the spatial correlation between the residual distribution and the geometric characteristics of the urban landscape.","Ye, Xin","Ren, Huazhong","Wang, Pengxin","Zhu, Jinshun","Zhu, Jian",,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS,Atmospheric modeling,Spatial resolution,Land surface temperature,Remote sensing,Land surface,Computational modeling,Buildings,Radiance transfer model,remote sensing,thermal infrared (TIR),ultrahigh spatial resolution,urban landscape,LAND-SURFACE TEMPERATURE,SKY-VIEW FACTOR,EMISSIVITY,RETRIEVAL,IMAGES,,,,,,,,,2023,Thermal Infrared Radiance Transfer Modeling of the Urban Landscape at Ultrahigh Spatial Resolution

Exploring how urban expansion influences ESs are critical for generating guidelines for urban planning and improving the development of urban agglomerations (UAs). However, previous studies have lacked analyses of urban expansion and its association with ESs in UAs in China. In this study, we analyzed year-by-year land-use data from 1992 to 2015 and explored the impact differences of urban expansion on ESs using a Tobit regression model. The results revealed that urban-land area showed a continuously increasing trend in UAs during the study period. Especially after 2000, a more pronounced increase in urban-land area and urban expansion intensity index was detected. Simultaneously, the ecosystem services value (ESV) showed a sharp reduction. Forestland had the highest sensitivity coefficient ranging from 0.496 to 0.505. Moreover, we found that counties with a high urban expansion differential index gradually showed in areal UAs and exhibited a clustered feature in northwest China. Additionally, high-average ESV counties were mainly distributed in the periphery of the UAs. In general, urban expansion had a negative impact on the ESV in all UAs, except for the Northern Tianshan Mountain UAs. The West Taiwan Strait, Jinzhong, and Pearl River Delta UAs were most affected by urban expansion, with the proportion of urban land increasing by an average of 1%, and the ESV decreasing by 0.77%, 0.75%, and 0.73%, respectively. In contrast, the Dianzhong UAs was the least affected.

Row_79,"This study aimed to propose a method for simulating ground surface temperature and surface heat balance using thermal infrared remote sensing and an urban surface heat balance model and to conduct a simulation in the Tokyo metropolitan area. Previous studies have typically employed ground surface temperatures obtained through satellite remote sensing to analyze urban thermal environments. However, these studies were limited to using surface temperature data available only at the time of satellite passage. Therefore, in this study, we conducted a simulation for the Tokyo metropolitan area by integrating a one-dimensional heat balance model with ground surface temperatures observed by satellites. The novelty of this study lies in the utilization of parameters related to heat balance obtained through calculations of physical processes, as opposed to relying on empirical formulas or parameters. Consequently, realistic ground surface characteristics, including parameters such as evaporation efficiency and thermal inertia essential for the simulation, were derived by this combined method. Furthermore, diurnal variations in ground surface temperature distributions were accurately represented by using realistic surface temperature data based on satellite remote sensing, considering the effect of heat storage in urban areas-an aspect challenging to reproduce using conventional local meteorological models.","Hirano, Yujiro","Ichinose, Toshiaki","Ohashi, Yukitaka","Shiraki, Yohei","Onishi, Akio","Yoshida, Yukiko",,,,,,,,,,,,,2,SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY,heat balance simulation,surface temperature,thermal remote sensing,urban heat island,evaporation efficiency,thermal inertia,CANOPY MODEL,ENERGY-CONSUMPTION,LAND-USE,NUMERICAL-SIMULATION,ANTHROPOGENIC HEAT,ISLAND PHENOMENA,AIR-TEMPERATURE,IMPACT,COUNTERMEASURES,CLIMATE,,,,,,,,,,OCT 1 2024,Simulation of urban surface temperature and surface heat balance in the Tokyo metropolitan area
Row_80,"During rapid urbanization in developing countries, changes in land use and land cover (LULC) can significantly alter urban land surface temperatures (LST), exacerbating the urban heat island (UHI) effect and degrading the outdoor environment. In this study, taking Guangzhou, China, as an example, we used Landsat series satellite data from 1992 to 2022, classified the LULC of the study area by the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method, estimated the LST of the area by the mono-window algorithm, and classified the LST of the study area into five UHI intensity classes based on the normalized values of the LST, and explored the influence of the LULC on the distribution of the UHI intensity. The CA-ANN (cellular automata-artificial neural network) model in QGIS software was employed to forecast the distribution of LULC and UHI intensity in Guangzhou for 2032. The findings reveal a strong correlation between UHI intensity and LULC, with water bodies and vegetation primarily exhibiting low and sub-low temperatures, while urban areas exhibit sub-high and high temperatures. The prediction results show that, according to the current development trend, compared with 1992, the water body and vegetation cover in 2032 will decrease by 46.97% and 34.24%, the building land will increase by 263.71%, and the sub-high and high temperature areas will increase by 127.76% and 375.92%. By analysing the spatial and temporal changes in LULC and its relationship with the distribution of UHI intensity during urbanization, this study assists government administrations and urban planners in devising sensible urban development strategies and implementing effective measures to plan LULC rationally.

This study investigated the impact of land use change and Low -Impact Development (LID) systems on urban runoff quality and quantity in the second region of Tehran. Pioneering an innovative approach, the integration of the Land Change Modeler (LCM) with the Stormwater Management Model (SWMM) signifies a paradigm shift in urban water management. Combined with other hydrological models, this new approach provides a comprehensive method for assessing the future effectiveness of LID practices. The Event Mean Concentration Method (EMC) was used in this study to measure Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Phosphorus (TP), and Zinc (Zn) in urban runoff from five land uses. Results pinpointed transportation land uses as the primary source of pollutants. Using LCM, the study forecasted a surge in urban runoff pollutants by 2030, particularly in the Northwest area of the region due to anticipated land use shifts towards commercial and residential land uses. Model results showed an 11 % increase in TSS over a decade, highlighting the importance of land use change in runoff quality. The study used three types of LIDs to reduce contaminants in dense urban areas. Assessing the impact of LID scenarios on runoff pollutants using SWMM revealed that the bio-retention cell had the best performance, reducing TSS by 20.92 %, and the vegetative swale had the worst performance, reducing TSS by 8.43 %. The study also concluded that combining LIDs would be more effective than using them separately. The results of this study suggest that LID systems can be an effective way to reduce urban runoff pollutants and improve water quality in the second region of Tehran. However, more research is needed to optimize the design and placement of LID systems in different urban areas.","Naeini, Alireza Motovalibashi","Tabesh, Massoud","Soltaninia, Shahrokh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,SWMM,LCM,Urban runoff,Stormwater management,Low impact development,Land use change,STORMWATER MANAGEMENT,URBAN STORMWATER,OPTIMIZATION,PERFORMANCE,SCALE,CITY,AREAS,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 1 2024,Modeling the effect of land use change to design a suitable low impact development (LID) system to control surface water pollutants
Row_82,"Urbanization changes land cover through the expansion of impermeable surfaces, leading to a significant rise in runoff, sediment, and nutrient loading. The quality of stormwater is related to land use and is highly variable. Currently, stormwater is predominantly described through watershed models that rely minimally, if at all, on field monitoring data. The simple event mean concentration (EMC) wash-off approach by land use is a common method for estimating urban runoff loads. However, a major drawback of the EMC approach is it assumes concentration remains constant across events for a specific land use. Build-up/wash-off equations have been formulated to consider variations in concentration between events. However, several equation parameters are challenging to estimate, making them difficult to use. We conducted a monitoring and modeling study and investigated the impact of land use on stormwater quantity and quality and optimized and investigated the buildup/wash-off parameters for three homogenous urban land uses to estimate nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and sediment loads. Stormwater from commercial, medium-density residential, and transportation land uses was sampled using automatic samplers during storm events, and water quality was characterized for a variety of them for 14 months. Analysis of stormwater samples included assessments for total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total suspended solids. Results showed that medium-density residential land use had the highest median total nitrogen and total phosphorus event mean concentrations and commercial had the highest median total suspended solids EMCs. Water quality parameters (or build-up/wash-off parameters) exhibited significant variation between land uses, confirming that land use is a key determinant of stormwater quality. The median particle size for each land use was less than 150 mu m, indicating that the most common particle size in stormwater was a very fine sand or smaller. This small size should be considered by stakeholders in the design of stormwater treatment systems.","Behrouz, Mina Shahed","Sample, David J.","Kisila, Odhiambo B.","Harrison, Michael","Yazdi, Mohammad Nayeb","Garna, Roja Kaveh",,,,,,,,,,,,,2,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,Land use,Urban runoff quality,Event mean concentration,Build-up and wash -off,SWMM,Parameter estimates,LOW-IMPACT DEVELOPMENT,WASH-OFF,URBAN CATCHMENTS,WATER-QUALITY,MANAGEMENT,INFRASTRUCTURE,LOADS,URBANIZATION,OPTIMIZATION,COMMUNITIES,,,,,,,,,,MAY 2024,Parameterization of nutrients and sediment build-up/wash-off processes for simulating stormwater quality from specific land uses

This is a unique, first-time study that adds a ""missing piece"" of this information about the African continent to the comprehensive global urban precipitation ""puzzle."" The convection-permitting Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model is employed within an ensemble simulation framework using combinations of different physical schemes and boundary/initial conditions to detect the urban signal on an extreme rainfall event that occurred on 30 May 2006. WRF simulations are verified against satellite-estimated and in situ observations, and the results from the best-performing ensemble members are used for analysis. The results show that the control simulation with urban representation generated 20%-30% more rainfall over the urban area than the nonurban sensitivity simulation, in which the city is replaced by forest. Physical mechanisms behind the differences were revealed. We found that the urbanization in Lagos reduced evapotranspiration, resulting in the increase of sensible heating (by 75 W m22). This further enhances the urban heat-island effect (11.5 K of air surface temperature), facilitating horizontal convergence and boosting daytime sea breeze. As a result, more moisture is transported from the southern sea area to inland areas; the moisture then converges over Lagos city, creating favorable conditions for enhancing convection and extreme-rainfall-generating processes.","Doan, Quang-van","Kobayashi, Shun","Kusaka, Hiroyuki","Chen, Fei","He, Cenlin","Niyogid, Dev",,,,,,,,,,,,,9,JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY,Africa,Atmosphere-land interaction,Extreme events,Precipitation,Urban meteorology,LAND-COVER CHANGE,HEAT-ISLAND,BOUNDARY-LAYER,CANOPY MODEL,RAINFALL,IMPACT,CLOUD,URBANIZATION,GROWTH,SCHEME,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 2023,Tracking Urban Footprint on Extreme Precipitation in an African Megacity

In the present study, a high-resolution numerical Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with a single-layer urban canopy model (UCM) is implemented for Hefei to assess the influences of LULC and climate change simultaneously. The comprehensive increase in UHI intensity (UHII) was 0.76 K from 2003 to 2019 in the study area.

The results also show that the emergence of new high-intensity urban areas developed from farmlands had the strongest impact on UHI development compared to other types of LULC changes. The overall contribution of climate change to the UHII increased by 0.27 K from 2003 to 2019.

Row_85,"3D spatial data are widely used to simulate various urbanistic phenomena, thanks to their valuable semantic, geometric, and topologic information. CityGML is a highly adopted data standard for semantic 3D city models, providing a standardized description of the cityscape that enables interoperability across different stakeholders. When future scenarios for urban development are simulated, the simulation results can be visualized and further analyzed in synthetically generated 3D city models. However, land use and constructability regulations are often overlooked when generating synthetic 3D city models for simulation purposes, despite some regulatory urban constraints having a direct impact on simulation results. For instance, the roof shape is highly correlated with building solar energy potential, while the zoning maximum allowed number of apartments directly influences the buildings' urban density estimation. Therefore, integrating such constructability knowledge within 3D city models is crucial. This paper proposes a framework for mapping urban planning rules defined in the German XPlanung standard onto 3D city models structured in compliance with CityGML to ensure legislative validity and real-life applicability.

Row_86,"In the context of rapid urbanization and global warming, the urban heat island (UHI) intensifies the risk of heatrelated mortality, endangering the health of urban residents. Urban greening effectively mitigates severe urban heating climates, but increasing green space without restrictions is undesirable due to the scarcity of urban land. Accurately characterizing the scope and intensity of UHI and determining the spatial location of the area that needs to be optimized are necessary. In this study, an inverse S-shaped function was used to fit the urban -rural temperature attenuation, whose parameters explicitly describe the properties of UHI. Additionally, a thermal knowledge-informed multi -type ant colony model was proposed to cool UHI automatically. A case study of Wuhan showed that: (1) the fitting effect of the inverse S-shaped function is desirable with the adjusted R 2 exceeding 0.97, and the derived parameters with clear physical meanings avoid subjectivity in describing thermal characteristics; (2) high-level heat island of the main urban areas can be reduced by 7.7% - 8.5% after land use optimization; and (3) a comparison with the traditional multi -type ant colony model verifies that the model proposed in this study can avoid excessive dispersion of the optimized pixels whose land use types are modified and achieve more reasonable and stable optimization results.

The existing framework cannot accurately reflect the spatial distribution of carbon emissions, making it difficult to guide urban planning and management. Therefore, in this study, a carbon emission spatial simulation and prediction model was established. The model includes the GIS-Kernel Density sub-model for subdividing built-up area, the Land Use-Carbon Emission sub-model for establishing the correlation between land use and carbon emissions, the Multi Objective Programming-Principal Component Analysis-BP neural network sub-model for presetting development scenarios, and the Patch-generating Land-use Simulation sub-model for predicting.

All scenarios were simulated, and the carbon emissions and their spatial distribution were calculated. The results showed that the overall accuracy of the simulation exceeded 90%. Under the optimal path, Xi'an's carbon emissions reach 60.6 million tons at peak time, which will be reduced to 47.38 million tons by 2060. In addition, the model analyzed the temporal and spatial changes of carbon sources and sinks and drew up the path of carbon reduction by technology and urban planning.

Row_88,"Cellular automata (CA) is a classical method for studying land use change. However, homogeneous transformation rules have commonly been used to conduct simulations in the past, and these rules seldom consider the spatial heterogeneity of geographic elements. Therefore, in this study, we incorporated spatial-temporal heterogeneity transformation rules into the CA framework based on spatial data mining. A model that couples selforganizing maps (SOM), hierarchical clustering (HC), and patch generation land use simulation (PLUS) was proposed; it is called the SOM-HC-PLUS model. This model considers the difference in local-area driving factors, and therefor it not only determines the optimal partition scheme automatically, but it also measures the contribution of partition driving factors. The Jinpu New Area in Dalian, China, was used to test the validity of the model by comparing the traditional PLUS model and the administrative division (AD)-PLUS model based on AD partition. The results showed that the partition scheme of the SOM-HC-PLUS model was reasonable and credible. Further, compared with other models, this model showed higher simulation accuracy and a more realistic land use distribution pattern. The driving factors showed significant differences in the overall and regional intensity. Moreover, the importance of natural environmental conditions, represented by elevation factors, in the expansion of artificial surfaces increased significantly. By 2030, artificial surfaces were projected to increase significantly through the conversion of cultivated lands. The sustainable development scenario showed a more compact patch layout and exhibited better protection of grasslands and forests than the historical development scenario. In summary, this study proposed a mixture CA model based on the idea of geographic partition, one that proved the reliability of the SOM-HC-PLUS model to conduct spatial-temporal heterogeneity studies on land use partition.

This study aims to monitor and simulate the scenario of the biophysical indicators in response to urbanization and climate change in the Rangpur district, Bangladesh. Landsat 4-5 TM and 8 OLI satellite images, data regarding meteorological conditions, and biophysical indicators from 2001 to 2020 were used to quantify the LULC, PA, and VC changes and predict future scenarios for 2025 and 2030 using machine learning algorithms such as cellular automata (CA) and artificial neural network (ANN).

Row_91,"Rapid urban expansion, accompanied by intense landscape changes, significantly affects natural habitats. Promoting sustainable urban development, such as the compact city strategy, is essential to balance ecosystem conservation and socio-economic development. Previous studies have generally focused on exploring the ecosystem impact of urban expansion concerning the future projections of climate, population, and economic development. Less attention has been paid to how different urban forms modify the landscape and affect habitats at a fine resolution. This study has built a framework to demonstrate future land use change under various city compaction scenarios using a bottom-up Cellular Automata (CA) model and a top-down Markov model. Then the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model was incorporated to evaluate the resultant habitat quality. By taking the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) as the study area, three future compact city scenarios in 2040 and 2060 were proposed to examine the accumulative effect of urban growth. The results show that by 2040, the high-compact scenario will cause the highest habitat quality degradation among all scenarios due to marked cropland displacement induced by urban edge expansion. By 2060, intensified medium or low-compact scenarios tend to create new urban clusters outside the existing urban areas, resulting in severe habitat isolation and fragmentation. The GBA presents significant spatial heterogeneity in habitat quality variation because of the uneven development between the core and key node cities. Our results suggest that a collaborative strategy should be promoted to motivate the unique advantages of each city. This could include maintaining the amount and connectivity of open space under city integration processes and reserving high-quality cropland, such as fish-pod-based agriculture, to mitigate habitat quality degradation.

Row_92,"Urban land is a fundamental but scarce resource that carries intensive human socio-economic activities. The demographic decline and housing vacancy issues that emerged with de-industrialization have raised concerns regarding the sustainable utilization of urban land resources, particularly in the American Rust Belt region. In this context, a comprehensive analysis of industrial land use can offer valuable insights to support the sustainable planning of shrinking cities. However, existing urban land research exhibits insufficient resolution at the sectoral scale and impedes the evaluation of industrial land use efficiency within the urban context. To address this gap, we established an integrated land use estimation framework for economic sectors based on multi-source data, which enables the assessment of land use efficiency at a finer sectoral scale. The method was then applied to the city of Detroit, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh. The results demonstrate that the current industrial land mix in the three cities is dominated by service-providing industries, but the land usage by goods-producing sectors in these cities presents a relatively high level of efficiency. The Moran's I value indicates a clustered tendency for the main economic sectors. The land use area results reveal that Other Services occupies the most land area in Detroit (2.29 million m2) and Cleveland (2.04 million m2). While in Pittsburgh, Professional Scientific and Technical Services (1.44 million m2) is the largest. In terms of the economic output, Management of Companies and Enterprises is the most efficient sector in Detroit (20.28 thousand $/m2) and Cleveland (29.43 thousand $/m2), while Pittsburgh's Public Administration (11.73 thousand $/m2) is the most efficient. As many other cities in the world are about to enter the era of de-industrialization or low growth, the outcomes can also serve as a reference to guide their sustainable revitalization in line with the SDGs.","Han, Zhixiu","Xie, Wei","Yu, Huajun","Xie, Hongyi","Li, Yang","Wang, Yutao",,,,,,,,,,,,,2,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,Land use,Land use efficiency,Rust belt,Urban shrinkage,Sustainable development,URBAN,DETROIT,CITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 14 2024,Rethinking industrial land-use in American rust cities towards sustainability based on a block-level model
Row_93,"Dramatic land cover changes related to the accelerated urbanization process have led to habitat fragmentation and loss, resulting in biodiversity loss. Ecological Networks (ENs) have been seen as an effective solution for ecological conservation targeting habitat connectedness and ecosystem functions. The EN research is, however, generally depicted by current or historical landscape data, devoid of the potential future disturbances, which is detrimental to maintaining EN's stability and sustainability. This study combines the system dynamics (SD) model and patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) to simulate land use patterns in Wuhan urban agglomeration (WUA), China. The simulated land use data were incorporated into EN modeling to assess the long-term dynamics of EN in WUA, considering two scenarios related to human activities and climate change. In parallel, a landscape graphs approach is used to estimate the spatial priority of EN for conservation in landscape dynamics. The results show that: (1) The grassland decreased from 2000 to 2020 and is expected to increase from 2020 to 2035. The area of construction land would reach its peak in 2035 while cultivated land would hit a low point. (2) Analysis of EN reveals habitat fragmentation and reduced connectivity from 2000 to 2020. From 2020 to 2035, an increase in EN connectivity is expected to be observed in the SSP5-8.5 scenario, while SSP2-4.5 is the reduced scenario. (3) Southern and eastern WUA exhibit high conservation priority. The hotspots of local landscape changes are mainly the corridors that traverse through human activity areas and the edges of core habitats, which is critical to conserving. (4) The impact of natural and socioeconomic factors on EN exhibits spatial heterogeneity.

Row_94,"Urban heat island (UHI) has become a worldwide concern under global warming and urbanization waves, which pose significant threats to human health and urban sustainability. Despite Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) being regarded as a crucial factor influencing UHI, few studies simulated the nonlinear influences from LULC compositions and configurations, especially considering the difference between monocentric and polycentric cities. Therefore, we measured the patterns of LULC and UHI from 2006 to 2022 using cases of a monocentric city (Chengdu) and a polycentric city (Chongqing). Further, we simulated future and land surface temperature (LST) using Machine Learning (ML) models, and further calculated the simulated UHI in 2030 by urban-rural LST differences. The results showed that Chengdu had prominent UHI intensity in cores and the surrounding satellite towns. Chongqing's main center and subcenters had high UHI intensity under clustered patterns. ML results indicated that built-up percentage was the most crucial factor driving LST. Configuration factors dominated in impacting Chengdu's LST, while composition factors were more critical in Chongqing. Moreover, future UHI is estimated to decrease in Chongqing's core, compared with the remaining high UHI in Chengdu's core. These results might provide insights for understanding and mitigating future UHI effects.","Liu, Yong","An, Zihao","Ming, Yujia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY,Land use/land cover,Urban heat island,Machine Learning,Simulation,SURFACE TEMPERATURE,THERMAL ENVIRONMENT,POLYCENTRICITY,PRODUCTIVITY,EFFICIENCY,PATTERN,CITIES,FORM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 1 2024,Simulating influences of land use/land cover composition and configuration on urban heat island using machine learning
Row_95,"We used the distributed hydrologic model GSSHA to simulate overland runoff from impervious and semipervious (low vegetation) land covers in a 0.3 km2 urban catchment. The model is hypothetical, which allowed us to test alternative land use configurations and better understand the effects of urban heterogeneity. To track the arrival of water to a stormwater basin inlet from distinct parts of the catchment, we applied a conservative solute tracer to portions of the gridded model area, a new application for GSSHA's 'contaminant transport' module. We rearranged the positions of pervious and impervious land uses over the catchment during four storm events and found that the portion of total runoff volume from impervious areas varied from 50 to 75% while the relative proportion of impervious cover remained constant at 54%. We also applied solute to equalsized zones with different slopes and land uses and found that percent imperviousness did not predict solute mobilization. Furthermore, variation in total runoff volume and peak discharge for different land use arrangements and storm sizes showed that percent imperviousness could not be used to estimate a runoff-rainfall ratio. Fluctuating solute proportions over time suggested that grab samples might not be adequate for capturing average overland runoff chemistry. We quantified factors contributing to non-linearity in rainfall-runoff responses from an urban watershed with stormwater infrastructure and determined that using models to find hotspots for stormwater infiltration and to explore resilience to future storm events can improve design and function of stormwater control measures.","Kirker, Ashleigh N.","Toran, Laura",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,GSSHA,Urban runoff,Impervious surfaces,Distributed -parameter model,Rainfallrunoff analysis,Event Mean Concentrations,Stormwater management,VARIABLE SOURCE AREA,SURFACE,CATCHMENTS,SOIL,IMPACTS,GREEN,LOADS,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2023,When impervious cover doesn't predict urban runoff: Lessons from distributed overland flow modeling
Row_96,"In limited land space, improving the construction of infrastructure with ecological services can help to achieve the goal of promoting land use eco-efficiency (LUEE). In view of this, this study constructed interactive coordination relationship model of green infrastructure (GI) and LUEE that involves entropy method model, super-efficiency slack-based measure (SBM) model with undesirable outputs, and coupling coordination degree model. The interactive coordination relationship model can help to study and reveal the mechanisms of interaction and the coordination relationship between GI and LUEE from a land benefit and ecological perspective. We took the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration as the study area. The results showed that the assessment results of GI showed a decreasing trend from 2000 to 2020. LUEE in different cities displayed obvious variability with efficiency values ranging from 0.5666 to 2.4437. The relationship between GI and LUEE is in the stage of uncoordinated development in 53.8% of cities, mainly concentrated in the eastern and southern parts of the study area. The unnatural human activities are the critical factors affecting interactive coupling coordination degree of LUEE and GI. It is clarified that the level of coordination relationship of the two can be used as an important indicator to judge the sustainable development of urban agglomerations. Intensive use of land, optimal connection of geographic information, and localization of policies would help improve the balance and coordination between the two.

Row_97,"ContextEvaluating the impacts of future urban expansion on natural habitats in China is important for achieving sustainable development goals. However, existing models cannot reliably and effectively simulate future urban expansion in China, which causes great uncertainties in evaluating the impacts of future urban expansion on natural habitats.ObjectivesThe objective of this study was to simulate future urban expansion and evaluate its impacts on natural habitats in China.MethodsFirst, the Land Use Scenario Dynamics-urban (LUSD-urban) model was improved by coupling localized Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). Then, urban expansion in China was simulated from 2020 to 2050 by using the improved LUSD-urban model. Finally, we evaluated the potential impacts of future urban expansion on natural habitats.ResultsThe localized SSPs could more reliably represent future socioeconomic development trends in China, and the CNN could fully extract the multiscale neighborhood information of nonurban pixels. By combining the advantages of the localized SSPs and the CNN, the simulation accuracy of the improved LUSD-urban model increased by 15-32% compared with that of other models. From 2020 to 2050, urban land is projected to increase by 6.84 (3.94-9.03) x 10(4) km(2) and cause a 2.21 (1.23-2.95) x 10(4) km(2) loss of natural habitat. Compared with the 1990-2020 period, the impacts of future urban expansion on natural habitats will intensify. Natural habitat loss during 2020-2050 will be 1.23 (1.22 to 1.64) times greater than that during 1990-2020. In addition, grasslands will experience the most serious losses under the influence of future urban expansion.ConclusionsWe suggest that relevant policies be issued to protect important natural habitats during urbanization to achieve Sustainable Development Goals and biodiversity conservation targets in China.","Lu, Wenlu","Zhang, Da","Ren, Qiang","Qi, Tao","He, Chunyang",,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,Urban expansion,Natural habitats,Shared Socioeconomic Pathways,Convolutional neural network,Sustainable development,CELLULAR-AUTOMATA,CONSERVATION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2023,Impacts of future urban expansion on natural habitats will intensify in China: scenario analysis with the improved LUSD-urban model
Row_98,"Forecasting cities' carbon emissions is an essential support for peak carbon emissions. Previous studies have mainly focused on estimating carbon emissions at large regional scales. Higher spatial resolution mapping of carbon emissions and simulation of future scenarios are important to support locally appropriate policy guidance to reduce carbon emissions. This paper proposes a bottom-up cadastral parcel-scale Carbon emission forecasting framework based on Vector-based Cellular Automata (CarbonVCA) by integrating land use modelling and carbon emission estimation. Shenzhen's cadastral parcel-scale carbon emissions from 2020 to 2060 are predicted as a case study. A good performance was achieved using CarbonVCA (MAPE = 19.017 %, RMSE = 0.175 Mtpa (C)). Three progressive scenarios are designed for carbon emission simulation from land use planning and energy structure restructuring perspectives. The designed carbon emission reduction scenario limits carbon emissions and enables Shenzhen to achieve peak carbon emissions between 2025 and 2030. However, the efforts to reach peak carbon emissions may prompt the relocation of industrial land to the suburbs. Such areas will need appropriate infrastructure construction to break through terrain and landscape constraints, maintain economic growth and achieve sustainable development. This framework can forecast a high spatial resolution of land-usebased carbon emissions, which helps construct low-carbon cities.","Yao, Yao","Sun, Zhenhui","Li, Linlong","Cheng, Tao","Chen, Dongsheng","Zhou, Guangxiang","Liu, Chenxi","Kou, Shihao","Chen, Ziheng","Guan, Qingfeng",,,,,,,,,21,CITIES,Carbon emission forecasting,Vector -based cellular automata,Peak carbon emissions,Cadastral parcel,Urban ecology,URBAN LANDSCAPE PATTERN,LAND-COVER CHANGE,CELLULAR-AUTOMATA,URBANIZATION,SIMULATION,MODEL,INDUSTRIALIZATION,VALIDATION,EVOLUTION,CLIMATE,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2023,CarbonVCA: A cadastral parcel-scale carbon emission forecasting framework for peak carbon emissions
Row_99,"The assessment of heavy metal (HM) distributions, sources, and potential risks is the first step of high-efficiency contaminant degradation and sustainable water resource utilization. In this study, the assessment of nine HMs from a typical urban river (Yongding River) in Beijing, China was implemented. Results evidence that the mean HM concentrations decreased in order: Mo > V > As > Zn > Ni > Mn > Fe > Cr > Co. The concentration of As, Zn, Mn, Fe, and Mo has a significant increase in the middle reaches, indicating agricultural and industrial pollution sources nearby. Three factors were extracted via principal component analysis, suggesting that As, Ni, Co, Mo, and V are mainly derived from anthropogenic inputs. Mn and Cr likely originated from natural sources, while Fe and Zn stemmed from mixed origins. The HM contamination levels are moderate and concentrated on As and Cr. Strong correlations among HMs and regional land use also confirmed the result. The noncarcinogenic and carcinogenic risks of HMs were evaluated based on four age groups by Monte Carlo simulation. Although the results of environmental modeling revealed a weak carcinogenic risk of As in adults (6.20 x 10-5), the risk for juveniles cannot be ignored. Target hazard quotients analysis implied relatively low noncarcinogenic risk when consuming fish tissues from rivers, and the carcinogenic risk of inorganic As in fish was acceptable.

Row_100,"Cities are growing in size and becoming increasingly dense. This situation calls for strategic planning of green infrastructure in the urban planning process. Safeguarding the green infrastructure is important for maintaining urban ecosystem services and increasing the well-being of urban populations. To facilitate appropriate urban planning that enables cities to grow sustainably, it is important that the geospatial community provides adequate vegetation information. In this study, we investigate the need for vegetation information in urban planning applications such as modelling ecosystem services and noise, as well as performing case studies of using vegetation information in daylight and solar energy simulations. Based on these investigations, we formulate a recommendation of how vegetation information should be included in 3D city models. The study is focused on the development of a Swedish national profile of CityGML, but many of the conclusions are general and universally applicable. In short, the recommendations are that: (1) the vegetation theme should follow CityGML 3.0 with some additional attributes (e.g., popular name of tree species) added as an application domain extension, (2) no LOD division is required for the vegetation information stored (but rather derived if necessary), (3) the vegetation theme should only contain 3D vegetation objects while the 2D vegetation is part of the land cover theme, and (4) the building specification (and city furniture specification) must include the possibility to store information on whether building roofs or facades (and walls) are covered with vegetation.","Pantazatou, Karolina","Kanters, Jouri","Mattisson, Kristoffer","Olsson, Per-Ola","Harrie, Lars",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,"RECENT ADVANCES IN 3D GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE, 3D GEOINFO 2023",3D city models,Vegetation,Land cover,Solar energy simulations,Daylight simulations,Sustainable urban planning,SIMULATION,HEAT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024,Recommendation for Vegetation Information in Semantic 3D City Models Used in Urban Planning Applications
Row_101,"Urban morphological change impacts the land surface temperature (LST) through modifying the net radiation, convective heat transfer, evapotranspiration, and heat storage on the ground. It is essential to quantify the contributions of these physical changes on LST changes. In this work, we conduct simulations using a weather research and forecasting model for the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration to identify causes of LST changes due to urban morphological changes through different morphological parameters: the aspect ratio, building plan area fraction, and average building height. A new method is proposed and used to quantify the contribution of these physical changes on LST changes. The results show as the aspect ratio increases, an increase of the average LST is induced by variations in radiation, and daytime cooling and nighttime warming are induced by variations in heat storage. There is warming associated with an increase in the building plan area fraction, which is mostly caused by a decrease in the efficiency of the long-wave radiant heat emitted from the surface to the atmosphere. We also find that an increase in the average building height enhance the efficiency of convective heat transfer, which results in cooling. These results are important for the management of urban thermal environments.Previous studies of the effects of urban morphological changes on the land surface temperature rarely quantified the contributions of different physical changes, including changes of the net radiation, convective heat transfer, evapotranspiration, and heat storage on the ground. Consequently, it is not clear which processes dominate the temperature changes. According to our analysis, which is based on simulations using a weather research and forecasting model, we found that an increase of the aspect ratio increases the radiation absorbed by urban surfaces, leading to an increase in the average temperature. As the aspect ratio increases, daytime cooling and nighttime warming result due to variations in heat storage. An increase of the building plan area fraction weakens the efficiency of the long-wave radiant heat emitted from the surface to the atmosphere, which leads to warming. We also find that there is cooling associated with an increase in the average building height, which is mostly induced by an increase in the efficiency of convective heat transfer. These results are important to understanding and design heat mitigation strategies.Land surface temperature response to urban morphological changes is attributed to different physical changes As the street aspect ratio increases, heat storage dominates the cooling effect during the daytime and the warming effect at nighttime The building area fraction affects the surface temperature mainly by changing the amount of long-wave radiation emitted by the surface","Tian, Yuhang","Xie, Zhenghui","Xie, Jinbo","Jia, Binghao","Chen, Si","Qin, Peihua","Li, Ruichao","Wang, Longhuan","Yan, Heng","You, Yanbin","Liu, Bin",,,,,,,,1,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES,urban morphological changes,land surface temperature,numerical simulation,emissivity-two-resistance mechanism method,regional climate,AIR-TEMPERATURE,CANOPY MODEL,HEAT-ISLAND,THERMAL ENVIRONMENT,BOUNDARY-LAYER,IMPACT,PARAMETERIZATIONS,CONFIGURATIONS,IMPLEMENTATION,HETEROGENEITY,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 16 2024,Analyzing the Land Surface Temperature Response to Urban Morphological Changes: A Case Study of the Chengdu-Chongqing Urban Agglomeration

To understand the influence of urbanization on flood characteristics including runoff, inundation and streamflow, it is essential to quantify the level of urbanization and analyze the corresponding impacts on flood. This study proposed an integrated and systematic framework to assess how urbanization affects flood characteristics in Hangzhou, China. Land use changes in 2000-2020 representing the level of urbanization were extracted from Landsat images with an ensemble machine learning method and future scenarios were designed with Patch-generating Land Use Simulation (PLUS). The runoff, inundation and streamflow under 24 h design rainfall with 100 year return period were assessed using the integrated hydrologic-hydraulic model for land use of different years. Finally, the relationship between land use changes and flood characteristics were identified and analyzed. It was found that the study area underwent a rapid urbanization process with artificial surface increasing from 6.93% to 29.12% during 2000-2020. Total runoff volume and total inundation volume showed a growing trend with a percentage change of 5.96% and 12.33% respectively under the design rainfall.

Conventional weather data, typically gathered at non-urban sites like airports, are used to create Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) files for building energy assessments. However, this data doesn ' t account for urban temperature effects, impacting the accuracy of these assessments. This study proposes a novel methodology that couples Local Climate Zones (LCZs) with the Urban Weather Generator (UWG) to produce urban-specific weather data reflecting UHI effects for more accurate energy simulations. LCZs categorize urban neighborhoods into landscape types based on building heights, proximity, greenspace, etc., which regulate the magnitude of the UHI. The UWG uses LCZ parameters to estimate UHI intensity based on existing weather conditions. Together, they generate city-specific TMY files tailored to individual neighborhoods. Here, modified TMY files for seven U.S. cities located in different climates, were generated and used in residential building energy simulations. The UHI effect increases Cooling Degree Days (CDD) and decreases Heating Degree Days (HDD), but energy demand impacts vary by city and LCZ type.

Considering the size range of these data sources, 10 fusion grid sizes were selected.

There is a high proportion of cultivated land and built-up land with strong absolute conflicts. The absolute conflict in the peripheral area is more serious. In addition, the peripheral area is the main source of relative conflict, and has advantages of development.

Row_106,"Land surface temperature (LST) derived from satellite observations and weather modeling has been widely used for investigating Earth surface-atmosphere energy exchange and radiation budget. However, satellite-derived LST has a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions and missing observations caused by clouds, while there are limitations such as potential bias and expensive computation in model calibration and simulation for weather modeling. To mitigate those limitations, we proposed a WRFM framework to estimate LST at a spatial resolution of 1 km and temporal resolution of an hour by integrating the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and MODIS satellite data using the morphing technique. We tested the framework in eight counties, Iowa, USA, including urban and rural areas, to generate hourly LSTs from June 1st to August 31st, 2019, at a 1 km resolution. Upon evaluation with in-situ LST measurements, our WRFM framework has demonstrated its ability to capture hourly LSTs under both clear and cloudy conditions, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.63 K and 3.75 K, respectively. Additionally, the assessment with satellite LST observations has shown that the WRFM framework can effectively reduce the bias magnitude in LST from the WRF simulation, resulting in a reduction of the average RMSE over the study area from 4.34 K (daytime) and 4.12 K (nighttime) to 2.89 K (daytime) and 2.75 K (nighttime), respectively, while still capturing the hourly patterns of LST.

This paper introduces a new framework for predicting land surface temperatures (LST). We introduce a heatscape index (SCSS) to establish a relationship between landscape patterns and LST within spatial grids. Furthermore, the framework employs an urban CA model, equipped with a sophisticated patch generation engine, to forecast urban landscapes under multiple scenarios. LST under these scenarios is then calculated based on the established regression relationship. Application of the framework in Wuhan yields valuable insights: (1) The regression coefficient (R2 = 0.85) between SCSS and LST indicates that changes in SCSS can well explain the spatial heterogeneity in LST, especially in areas with evident UHI effects. (2) The simulated and retrieved LST for 2015 shows high spatial consistency, achieving an R2 value of 0.81, indicating the model's credibility. (3) Scenario simulations demonstrate that rapid and compact urban land expansion would exacerbate the UHI effect, leading to extreme high-temperature areas expanding towards suburban regions and significant temperature increases in urban fringe areas.

After atmospheric correction using the COST (Cosine Theta) model, the maximum likelihood approach and post-classification differencing were applied respectively to classify the images and to reveal the land use changes. The Logistic-Multi-Criteria Evaluation-Celluar Automata-Markov (LMCM) hybrid model was harnessed to simulate the land use pattern of 2025 under four different scenarios namely business as usual (BAU), ecological protection (EP), economic development (ED) and sustainable development (SD). The results show that (1) during the period 2010-2020, the built-up areas increased by 804.69 km2 and the croplands decreased by 568.14 km2; (2) There seems to be a big difference between the predicted croplands and built-up areas in the four scenarios in 2025. Under the EP scenario, the built-up areas may likely gain an increase of 244.27 km2, indicating that the environment shall be protected but the urbanization will be also limited. Under the ED scenario, the built-up areas may be extended by 829.54 km2 and the croplands and forests are likely to decline significantly in 2025, meaning that overemphasizing urban development would not only threaten food security, but also bring harm to the local ecosystem. Under the SD scenario, the increase of built-up areas and the reduction of croplands would both come between the other scenarios, and the land use structure seems more stable and rational. Clearly, the SD scenario is the potential pathway for sustainable land use management in the long run.

We applied a classification by decision tree (DT) and Cellular Automata based on Artificial Neural Network (CA-ANN) model to predict future changes. Firstly, using the land cover map in 1984 and 2001 we predicted the land cover in 2019. The prediction accuracy between real and simulated land cover in 2019 was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) Curve and Kappa statistic metrics. With 92.10% of AUC (area under the curve) and 82.55% of correctness, the CA-ANN model could better simulate the spatial pattern of 2019 land cover. Then, after calibrating and validating, the spatial distribution of land cover in 2037 was generated. The results reveal that there is a substantial rivalry between built-up area (BUA) and agricultural land (AL) between 1984 and 2019. Bare land (BL), built-up area (BUA), and steppe/dry land (St/DL) have increased by 401.39%, 250.22%, and 97.18% while agricultural land (AL), irrigated land (IL), and dense forests (DF) have decreased by 56.75%, 51.30%, and 42.11%, respectively. The simulation findings show that built-up areas (BUA), agricultural land (AL), and agricultural/steppe land (Ag/SL) may rise by 28.78%, 15.17%, and 37.60%, respectively. Irrigated land (IL), bare land (BL), steppe/dry land (St/DL), and dense forests (DF) may decrease at a high rate by 84.56%, 85.27%, 67.91%, and 51.66%, respectively, by 2037. These findings enabled us to draw up precise statistical reports that would help land use planners and policymakers in framing more adequate and coherent policies.","Bendib, Abdelhalim","Berghout, Karima",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING,Agricultural land,Artificial neural network,Batna,Decision tree,Uncontrolled urbanization,COVER,MODEL,ENVIRONMENT,ALGORITHMS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2023,Use of the classification by a decision tree in the analysis of the effect of urban dynamics on the consumption of agricultural land in the municipality of Batna
Row_110,"Limited adaptation options and local-scale heat mitigation measures to counter elevated nighttime temperatures have increased the need for effective and equitable city-scale cooling measures. I proposed that cold and dense air from surrounding high landscapes, called drainage winds, could be a potential city-scale nocturnal heat mitigation measure. I further suggest that this measure can moderate spatial disparities in heat mitigation capacity due to the unequal distribution of urban trees in Portland, Oregon. First, I conducted KLAM_21 wind simulations using grid cells of 30 m with elevation and historical and recent land use types. Then, I used census block groups including the proportion of tree canopy area, socioeconomic variables, and simulated wind attributes in statistical analysis. I found: (1) KLAM_21 simulation results generally align with actual wind observations, (2) urban development over the last two decades lowered the cold air layer, and (3) marginalized neighborhoods with less tree canopy coverage experience greater nocturnal cooling effects from drainage winds. These results emphasize the potential of drainage winds as an equitable heat mitigation option in Portland. Urban planners should integrate scenario-based simulated wind data into heat mitigation strategies to foster a more equitable and comfortable nighttime thermal environment in the long term.","Jung, Meen Chel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY,Drainage winds,Tree canopy,Climate equity,Socioeconomic status,Urban landscape,KLAM_21,COLD-AIR DRAINAGE,URBAN STREET,TEMPERATURES,VENTILATION,SURFACE,ADAPTATION,SIMULATION,BUILDINGS,MORTALITY,ISLANDS,,,,,,,,,,MAR 2024,Potential for climate equity: Integrating nocturnal drainage winds into heat mitigation strategies in Portland
Row_111,"Contemporary investigations into cellular automata (CA) modeling often neglect the considerable influence of spatial heterogeneity on both spontaneous and self -organized processes of urban growth. In this research, we combined a partitioned quantity control strategy, the geographically weighted artificial neural network (GWANN), and a neighborhood size -adaptive approach to formulate a CA framework for simulating spatially heterogeneous spontaneous and self -organized urban growth (SHSS-CA). We examined the simulation performance of SHSS-CA in Beijing, Shanghai, and the Pearl River Delta during 2000-2010 for calibration and 2010-2020 for validation. The findings demonstrate that incorporating spatial heterogeneity enhances CA performance in approximately 90% of regions. Introducing spatially heterogenous spontaneous or self -organized urban growth rules alone can improve the simulation performance of CA. Furthermore, their integration leverages the strengths of both rules and makes SHSS-CA the optimal choice, resulting in a notable improvement in the figure of merit (FoM)-approximately 9% during calibration and around 5% during validation-when compared with ANN -CA. This study contributes new methodologies for developing urban growth simulation rules and has the capacity to effectively help urban planners understand and analyze the complicated urban growth processes.","Zhang, Bin","Hu, Shougeng","Wang, Haijun","Yang, Jianxin","Wang, Zhenzhen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,APPLIED GEOGRAPHY,Urban growth,Cellular automata,Spatial heterogeneity,Spontaneous,Self-organized,CELLULAR-AUTOMATA MODEL,LAND-USE,LOGISTIC-REGRESSION,SIMULATION,URBANIZATION,EXPANSION,DYNAMICS,REGION,ACCESSIBILITY,DETERMINANTS,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 2024,Incorporating spatial heterogeneity to model spontaneous and self-organized urban growth
Row_112,"How ventilation corridors affect urban climate is attracting researchers' attention. Taking the inland Chinese city of Wuhan as an example, this paper first uses remote sensing image technology to evaluate the urban thermal environment. Additionally, based on the GIS/RS spatial analysis method, the ventilation corridors in the central urban area are identified and constructed. Finally, the mesoscale meteorological model WRF-UCM is used to simulate four cases with different corridor forms to explore the impact of different corridors on the climate environment in Wuhan during the summer. The results indicate that: (1) The WRF-UCM model, when coupled with LCZ classification, can significantly improve the accuracy of mesoscale urban canopy meteorological field simulations. (2) The water corridors located in the central urban area can effectively regulate the temperature and wind environment during summer. In the high-temperature period of the day, the average temperature in the central city decreases by 0.3-0.4 degrees C, the heat island proportion index decreases by 1.61 %, and the strong heat island proportion index decreases by 1.89 % in the afternoon. During the period of low temperature, the average wind speed in the central urban area increased by 0.05 m/s increase, and even increased by 0.1 m/s. (3) The specific humidity value of the green corridor is reduced by 0.0000136 kg/kg in comparison to the construction land in the corridor, while the water corridor can increase by 0.000133 kg/kg. If the two kinds of surface, water and green land, are organically combined in the corridor, it will be able to improve the hot and humid conditions in Wuhan in summer. (4)Low-rise and low-density construction land as the corridors in the central urban area can not improve the urban thermal and wind environment. Through an attempt to conduct a complete workflow of urban heat island analysis, ventilation corridor identification and setting, urban climate simulation, analysis and summary, the authors believe that it is an effective set of working methods in sustainable urban planning, design, and policy-making.

Row_113,"Fast urbanization brings great challenges to sustainable development goals, such as excessive exploitation and population explosion. Classical cellular automata (CA) have been widely used to independently simulate the change of spatial features, i.e. land use, population, economic production, etc. However, most CA models rely on historical data as static driving factors to simulate future scenarios while ignoring the inter-wined influences among multiple features in the development process. To address this issue, this study proposes a spatial cooperative simulation (SCS) approach to simulate the land use, population, and economy changes. The SCS approach starts with a separate CA model to obtain the initial scenes of each feature. Then, the simulation results of each other two features are used as dynamically updated driving factors, rather than the static historical data, to capture the inter-wined influence of multiple features during the development process. This step is iteratively performed until the changes of each feature converge and the final simulation results will be reported. The simulation experiment in Greater Bay Area demonstrates that the SCS approach can well capture the simultaneous development process and outperforms baseline approaches. The SCS approach is capable of forecasting future development scenarios and facilitates spatial planning and infrastructure synergies.","Tu, Wei","Gao, Wei","Li, Mingxiao","Yao, Yao","He, Biao","Huang, Zhengdong","Zhang, Jie","Guo, Renzhong",,,,,,,,,,,7,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE,Spatial simulation,cooperative influence,cellular automata,Greater Bay Area,CELLULAR-AUTOMATA,LOGISTIC-REGRESSION,URBAN-GROWTH,MODELS,POLICY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 1 2024,"Spatial cooperative simulation of land use-population-economy in the Greater Bay Area, China"
Row_114,"Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of urban runoff is a major concern for urban management, imposing significant costs on the urban management system every year. Numerous; factors affect the quality, and quantity of urban runoff, such as population growth, urbanization, land use change and climate change. This paper aims to optimally design low-impact development (LID) strategies for qualitative and quantitative management of urban areas. Three runoff management methods, including vegetated swale, bioretention system, and porous pavement, were considered along with an urban drainage network. The stormwater management model (SWMM) was adopted to simulate urban runoff, and the slime mould algorithm (SMA) was employed to optimize LIDs. An urban area in Tehran, Iran, was examined using the proposed SWMM-SMA model, and the result was an optimal combination of LIDs. Three LIDs were individually defined for each subcatchment, and the results were compared to the combination of all LIDs in the whole catchment. The results indicated that the bioretention system was the most effective LID in improving the water quality in the case of individual LIDs. The system could reduce total suspended solids (TSS), total nitrogen (TN); and zinc (Zn) concentrations by 91, 78, and 74%. The results also suggested that the optimal combination of LIDs was more efficient, and it was able to further reduce TSS concentration by 14-16% compared to individual bioretention systems. Furthermore; the optimal combi-nation of LIDs was successful in minimizing TSS concentration in the runoff by using the SWMM-SMA model. By using the simulation-optimization model (SWMM-SMA), optimal LIDs and runoff quality could be effectively designed and controlled.","Eskandaripour, Mehrtash","Golmohammadi, Mohammad H.","Soltaninia, Shahrokh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12,SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY,Urban runoff,Qualitative management,Low -impact development,Storm water management model,Optimization,Slime mould algorhitm,WATER-QUALITY,MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION,GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE,1ST FLUSH,MODEL,PERFORMANCE,MANAGEMENT,SCALE,STORMWATER,INFILTRATION,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2023,Optimization of low-impact development facilities in urban areas using slime mould algorithm

The urban thermal environment and local microclimate have been changed and will affect human health and well-being for a long time, particularly in metropolitan areas. Land surface temperature (LST) for urban areas can be obtained from thermal infrared remote sensing observations, enabling the analysis of spatial and temporal variations in urban heat. However, there is very little published research on the modeling and analyzing land surface emissivity (LSE) for urban surfaces. LSE is a prerequisite for some inversion algorithms of LST such as the split-window algorithm, and it is also an important parameter in urban energy balance. Therefore, we proposed an analytical model for the urban LSE by using geometric optical (GO) and spectral invariant (SI) theories. The proposed model was evaluated based on both the synthetic and measured datasets. Results indicated that the simulation performance of proposed model was satisfactory with root mean squared error (RMSE) of approximately 0.004 and 0.009 when compared with datasets from 3D raytracing model and satellite-based emissivity product, respectively.","Bian, Z.","Roujean, J.L.","Irvine, M.","Li, H.","Xiao, Q.","Liu, Q.",,,,,,,,,,,,,0,IGARSS 2023 - 2023 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023,An Analytical Model for Urban Effective Emissivity by using Geometric Optical and Spectral Invariance Theroeis

This phenomenon, which represents morphological changes in urban areas, is called urban perforation. Urban perforation should be considered when discussing the spatial compaction of existing morphological urban areas; therefore, the morphological changes in urban areas caused by urban perforation must be simulated. However, suitable simulation methods have not been developed. This study applied the thinning point process developed in stochastic geometry to simulate the generation and accumulation of vacant plots and answered the following research questions based on empirical analysis in Sakura, Japan: (1) Can the thinning point process be used to simulate spatially random patterns of vacant plot generation in each built cluster? (2) Will accumulated vacant plots exhibit spatially random patterns in each built cluster after repeating the thinning point process? Evaluations of simulation performance revealed that the thinning point process did not always produce spatially random patterns of vacant plot generation and accumulation; however, the simulated dispersed patterns were logically consistent with urban perforation and revealed fragmented vacant plots. The results of this study may be used to predict future morphological urban areas in an era of urban shrinkage.","Usui, Hiroyuki",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE,Thinning point process,vacant plot,perforation,urban area,complete spatial randomness,SHRINKING CITIES,POLICY RESPONSES,LAND,DEMOLITION,CHALLENGE,SPRAWL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 3 2023,Simulation of urban perforation after random vacant plot generation: application of the thinning point process
Row_117,"Land use and land cover change (LUCC) process exhibits spatial correlation and temporal dependency. Accurate extraction of spatiotemporal features is important in enhancing the modeling capabilities of LUCC. Cellular automaton (CA) models, recognized as powerful tools for simulating dynamic LUCC processes, are traditionally applied in LUCC, focusing on time-slice driving factor data, often neglecting the temporal dimension. However, the transformer architecture, a highly acclaimed model in machine learning, has been rarely integrated into CA models for the simulation of dynamic LUCC processes. To fill this gap, we proposed a novel spatiotemporal urban LUCC simulation model, namely, transformer-convolutional neural network (TC)-CA. Based on CA models that involve the utilization of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for extracting latent spatial features, TC-CA extends this paradigm by incorporating a transformer architecture to extract spatiotemporal information from temporal driving factor data and temporal spatial features. The evaluation results with Wuxi city as a study area indicated the advantage of our proposed TC-CA against random forest-CA, conventional CNN-CA, artificial neural network-CA, and transformer-CA. Compared with the three non-transformer-based CAs, the TC-CA improved the figure of merit by up to 2.85%-8.14%.

This study aimed to discuss the effect of urbanization on the Bolgoda wetland, located in the Colombo Metropolitan Region (CMR), Sri Lanka.

Considering Natural Growth (NG) and Wetland Protection (WP) scenarios, we projected the future LUC changes (2030 and 2050) and evaluated the future ESV changes.

The scenario analysis indicated that the ESV will continue to decrease by USD 17 million/year in 2030 and USD 35 million/year in 2050 under the NG scenario. However, under the WP scenario, the decrease would only be about USD 0.96 million/year in 2030 and USD 11 million/year in 2050, respectively.

Row_120,"Construction land development suitability (CLDS) assessment holds paramount importance in contemporary urban planning and management. Previous CLDS studies have faced challenges such as insufficient evaluation indicators, model complexity, and limited interpretability. To address these gaps, this study applies three simplistic yet mature models from the field of geological hazard assessment - Weight of Evidence (WOE), Information Value (IV), and Frequency Ratio (FR) - to evaluate the CLDS in Wuhan, China, and examine their feasibility. In parallel, a comparative analysis with the Patch-generating Land Use Simulation (PLUS) model was conducted. The WOE, IV, and FR models demonstrate a gradual decrease in CLDS from the city center and the Yangtze and Han rivers towards the periphery. Conversely, the PLUS model indicates the highest suitability around the city's development boundaries, followed by the city center, with suburbs displaying lower suitability. In terms of accuracy, the PLUS model's CARS module outperforms others, particularly for micro-level urban expansion simulations. The IV and WOE models follow closely, manifesting a preference for macro-level urban planning. Additionally, this study pinpoints key drivers influencing CLDS, notably population density, distance to social service Points of Interest (POI) and proximity to road networks. The cross-validation of the WOE, IV, and FR models underscores their reliability, with their straightforward principles positioning them as valuable tools in urban development planning.

However, previous studies on the influencing mechanisms of HQ in arid urban agglomerations and future multi-scenario simulations remain limited. To fill this knowledge gap, this study aimed to reveal the influencing mechanisms in HQ changes and to develop a multi-scenario HQ assessment framework within arid urban agglomerations. We assessed the spatiotemporal variations in HQ using the InVEST model and three periods of LULC data for the urban agglomeration on the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains (UANSTM), and the partial least squares structural equation model was introduced to explore the interactions between natural and non-natural factors and their impacts on HQ. Additionally, we coupled multi-objective programming and PLUS models to predict the LULC under different optimization scenarios (natural development scenario (NDS), ecological protection scenario (EPS), ecological-economic coordinated scenario, and economic development scenario) for the UANSTM in 2030, and to assess HQ. Results show that (1) the HQ index of the UANSTM was 0.507, 0.520, and 0.495 in 2000, 2010, and 2020 respectively, with a spatial distribution pattern of high values in the west, low values in the east, and high in the central and low in the north and south; (2) geomorphic, climatic, and LULC factors have direct positive effects on HQ, while socio-economic factors have a direct negative effect on HQ. In addition, geomorphic, socio-economic, and climatic factors also influence HQ through potential indirect paths. Climatic and LULC factors enhance the positive effect of geomorphic on HQ while counteracting the direct negative effect of socio-economic factors on HQ.

This study investigates the fusion of urban building height predictions with conventional sprawl projections to offer a holistic 3D urban expansion foresight. We constructed a model for projecting urban building volume using socio-economic factors includes GDP, population, and urbanization indicators, enabling the anticipation of China's 2010-2100 building volume demand across five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). Furthermore, deep learning -based neural networks were harnessed for estimating land conversion probabilities and building heights. By aggregating the projected demand, we estimated spatial expansion and building heights for each scenario at ten-year intervals from 2010 to 2100. Compared to other products, our proposed method excels in spatial granularity and temporal continuity, which includes height properties in the 3D structure. According to the projections of this study, considering various SSPs, China's building volume is expected to reach approximately 4500 km3 to 6500 km3 by 2050, representing 1.3-1.9 times increase compared to 2010. Furthermore, forecasts for 2050-2100 anticipate a notable decline to 60 % of the 2050 demand. At a more local level, potential spatial imbalances may arise, as the projections indicate significant urban expansion in the eastern areas and a heightened density of urban land within existing city clusters.

However, there is a notable gap in research that specifically addresses the sensitivity of models traing with those data sets when it comes to regional modeling purposes. Accordingly, the objectives of this study were to calibrate, validate, and employ global urban input datasets for the regional simulation of urban growth by the year 2030. The SLEUTH urban growth model, focused on the metropolitan area of the Ruhr, Germany, was calibrated using the Global Human Settlement Layer, World Settlement Foot-print Evolution, historical OpenStreetMap data, and a Digital Land Cover Model for Germany. The goal was to compare the results in terms of accuracy, certainty, quantity, and allocation, particularly in urban areas susceptible to floods and heat. While all models achieved high accuracy levels concerning quantity and allocation, the extent of new settlements varied from 40.77 km2 to 477.91 km2. The models based on World Settlement Footprint and OpenStreetMap exhibited higher certainty and lower stochasticity. As the simulated urban growth increased, there was a corresponding rise in the likelihood of allocating new settlements in areas affected by natural hazards. While all models presented a similar relative portion of new settlement areas impacted by floods, variations emerged in terms of areas affected by unfavorable thermal conditions. This study underscored the potential use of historical OpenStreetMap data in training cellular automation for geosimulating future settlement growth.

There were large areas of Perth where spatial patterns of vegetation were sub-stantially different across datasets. The level of differences in spatial patterns between datasets varied with geographic context such as land use. Elements of a spatial pattern related to grass and tree composition were similar across datasets but there were differences in how shrubs and the configuration of vegetation features were captured. There were differences in the temporal change detection of vegetation patterns across datasets. Spatial patterns of vegetation and land cover generated using the three datasets were used as predictor variables of surface temperatures in machine learning workflows. In some cases, the models learned dataset specific re-lationships between elements of a vegetation pattern and surface temperature outcomes. In a final modelling analysis, spatial patterns of vegetation were considered as an outcome responding to a disturbance event, a change in dwelling density. The size of the effect of dwelling density change on vegetation patterns varied across vegetation datasets.","Duncan, John M.

Row_128,"Urban spatial structure factors can have considerable effects on traffic noise distribution. This study aimed to describe the spatial distribution characteristics of traffic noise and influencing factors in high-density cities. Fifteen indexes were selected from the three aspects of building layout, road organization and land use to analyse the influence of urban spatial structure factors on the noise spatial distribution. This paper selected the central area of Tianjin as the study area. The noise level was generated by the noise simulation software CadnaA, and the numerical statistics were determined by ArcGIS. The correlation between various urban indexes and the spatial distribution of traffic noise were determined with correlation analysis, and multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) analysis was used to determine the degree and scope of influence of various urban indexes on the spatial distribution of traffic noise. The results indicate that there are significant differences in the spatial agglomeration forms of high, medium, and low noise areas among research units, and the spatial agglomeration of low noise areas in each unit is stronger. The building layout indexes, except for the average building height (ABH), are significantly negatively correlated with the noise levels in low noise areas (L70-L90). The road length index (RLI), road area density (RAD), road landscape shape index (RLSI), trunk road length index (TRLI), proportion of traffic land (PT), and degree of land mixing (DLM) are significantly positively correlated with the noise levels of all areas within the unit (L10-L90). Among the three aspects of building layout, road organization, and land use, the architectural landscape shape index (ALSI), RAD, and DLM have the greatest influence on the average spatial sound pressure level (Lavg), with mean regression coefficients of -0.254, 0.520, and 0.174, respectively. The ground space index (GSI), ALSI, proportion of residential land (PR) and PT are the global factors influencing Lavg.","Zhou, Zhiyu","Zhang, Meng","Gao, Xuming","Gao, Jinfeng","Kang, Jian",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,APPLIED ACOUSTICS,Traffic noise,Spatial structure,Road organization,High-density cities,ENVIRONMENTAL NOISE,URBAN FORM,STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS,SMART CITIES,INDICATORS,MORPHOLOGY,MODEL,CITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 15 2024,Analysis of traffic noise spatial distribution characteristics and influencing factors in high-density cities
Row_129,"Air pollution is an inevitable negative environmental externality in the process of industrialization and urban-ization in countries around the world. Land misallocation in the process of urbanization and industrialization and the resulting urban sprawl exacerbates the above problems. As a major country in the stage of rapid urbanization and industrialization, China also faces severe air pollution problems. Therefore, this paper will systematically study the impact of land misallocation and urban sprawl on air pollution. We first set up the utility maximization problem of each economic entity in the process of land misallocation in the mathematical model, and form a general equilibrium theory model to analyze the relationship between land misallocation, urban sprawl and air pollution, and then put forward the research hypotheses. We further use the big data of land market transactions of China Land Market Network and LandScan global population data to build the land misallocation index and urban sprawl index respectively, and use an extended mediating effect model to empirically test the hypotheses. The results suggest that the effect of land misallocation on air pollution is significantly positive, and the impact of land misallocation on urban sprawl largely depends on the return rate of land relative to labor (RRIRL). When the RRIRL is relatively low, the impact is weak, or even has a negative effect to some extent. At this time, low transportation costs are conducive to reducing air pollution. On the contrary, when the RRIRL is relatively high, land misallocation has a significant role in promoting urban sprawl. At this time, high traffic costs are conducive to reducing air pollution. In addition, we also find that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between urban sprawl and air pollution. When the urban sprawl level is low, its impact on air pollution increases with the increase of its level, but once it exceeds a specific node, the impact will decrease. Based on the characteristics of the relationship among land misallocation, urban sprawl and air pollution under different RRIRL, we summarize four environmentally friendly urban development paths. We bring the land bid rent theory and environmental pollution research into a same theoretical model framework, which provides a modeling idea and research perspective with a micro-foundation for subsequent research on land misallocation. We integrate the research conclusions of existing literature and unify them under the research frameworks concerning different RRIRL in the empirical results, which greatly improving their applicability. The four urban development paths summa-rized in this paper will also provide inspiration for future researchers and policy makers.","Wang, Yuwei","Fan, Jianshuang","Liu, Dongtao","Fu, Jian","Ding, Liang","Zhang, Junshen",,,,,,,,,,,,,9,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,Land misallocation,Urban sprawl,Air pollution,INDUSTRIAL-STRUCTURE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 1 2023,"Air pollution outcomes, land misallocation, and the transmission through urban sprawl"
Row_130,"During the past two decades discussions on urban shrinkage have been increasing in intensity, mainly due to the irresistible trends of migration, economic transformation, and the so-called ""siphon effect"" of large and mega cities. Yet, very few studies have tried to understand urban shrinkage from the perspective of local microscopic unit evolution. This study develops a novel model for simultaneous simulation of expansion and shrinkage (MSSES) of urban built-up areas. Starting from a microscopic basis, our MSSES can simulate both the processes and the states that lead to spatial expansion or shrinkage. A MaxEnt model is further used to investigate the driving factors of microspatial changes and compute the probabilities of shrinkage (or expansion) of urban built-up areas. Finally, it simulates the explicit layout of the spatial distribution of shrinkage (or expansion) patches with the help of a sorting cellular automata (CA) model. The validity of MSSES is verified using multisourced data from the Wuhan agglomeration, China. We show that (1) MSSES can more accurately simulate urban expansion or shrinkage than the currently widely used neighborhood-based Logistic-CA (NL-CA) and (2) MSSES has advantage in solving the commonly seen problem of ""diffusion-coalescence,"" especially for the simulation of outlying expansion. Against the context of the Wuhan metropolitan area, we also found that overall the shrinkage trend is slowing down significantly, presenting three types of shrinkage at city-scale: remote shrinkage, peripheral shrinkage, and international shrinkage. Our study has contributions to the body of knowledge as well as practical implications for urban management and improving the sustainable development of urban areas in both China and abroad.The city we live in may be experiencing a situation where expansion and shrinkage are happening simultaneously. Hence, the simulation and prediction of temporal and spatial changes in urban expansion and shrinkage hold great importance in formulating urban policies. In this study, we propose a model capable of simultaneously predicting urban growth and shrinkage, and apply this model to the urban morphological changes in the Wuhan metropolitan area from 2000 to 2035. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this model in predicting the locations of urban expansion and contraction in advance. Furthermore, we discovered that the overall shrinkage trend is projected to significantly decelerate in the future. These findings offer support for intervention in urban planning, guiding the development of urban spaces and advancing the scientific aspects of urban planning.","He, Qingsong","Wang, Bo","Mou, Yanchuan","Tan, Ronghui","Zheng, Linzi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT,MaxEnt,CA,Shrinkage,Diffusion-coalescence,Wuhan agglomeration,MSSES,SPATIALLY EXPLICIT,GROWTH PATTERNS,CITIES,FORM,VITALITY,REGION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 1 2023,Simultaneous Simulation of Urban Shrinkage and Expansion Using Cellular Automaton and Maximum Information Entropy Models: Case Study of Urban Evolution in Wuhan Metropolitan Area
Row_131,"The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region is one of China's most urbanized areas, which has typical non-uniformity features of the underlying surface and complicated underlying surface structures that even manifest at the sub-kilometer scale. This research investigates the influence of subgrid nonuniformity on the simulation of the meteorological environment in the YRD region utilizing high-resolution land use data. The Noah_mosaic/Noah land surface scheme is used to perform a high-resolution sensitivity test with or without taking subgrid nonuniformity into account during the numerical simulation of summer 2020 and 2022 based on the WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting model) model, respectively. Results demonstrate that, in contrast to the Noah scheme, the Noah_mosaic scheme's simulation results have a stronger correlation with observations and a smaller inaccuracy, suggesting that it is more capable of accurately representing the intricate physical processes that occur beneath the surface of the urban agglomeration region. The suburban area becomes warmer and drier and the urban area gets colder and wetter after taking into account the subgrid nonuniformity. This difference is more pronounced at night, particularly in the temperature field, where the average temperature change is -0.14 degrees C/0.53 degrees C during the night and -0.04 degrees C/0.05 degrees C during the day in the urban/suburban area. Non-uniformity in simulation results can reach up to 400 m altitude, resulting in an increase in instability in the suburban atmosphere, particularly at night. At the same time, the body temperature rises by approximately 0.27 degrees C in almost all areas of land at night. In addition, it is found that when the proportion of buildings in the grid is less than 50%, except the daily minimum temperature T-min,, the meteorological elements change greatly with the increase of the proportion of buildings, and the growth rates of T-mean, and T-max reach 0.29 degrees C/10% and 0.55 degrees C/10% respectively, whereas the growth rates of T-mean, and T-max are only 0.1 degrees C/10% and 0.06 degrees C/10%, which suggests that the future development of small towns in low building density areas will have a greater impact on the meteorological environment.",Shu ZiJian,Ma HongYun,Zhang Mi,Liu YongHong,Ji Meng,Xu YongMing,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION,Sub-grid,Heterogeneity,Numerical simulation,Meteorological environment,HEAT-ISLAND,WRF SIMULATIONS,URBANIZATION,INDEX,RAINFALL,SUMMER,MODEL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 2024,The influence of sub-grid heterogeneity on regional meteorological environment simulation: A case of the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration
Row_132,"Heatwave is one of the most dangerous ""natural hazards"" with the greatest impact on people and other living beings that rarely receive adequate attention worldwide. Climate change & intense landcover conversion result in extreme heatwaves in urban areas. Chattogram, which is located in the southeast of Bangladesh, is a prominent coastal city and key economic hub. Chattogram City Corporation (CCC) consists of 41 wards with a large population, and most of the heavy, medium, and light industries of Bangladesh are situated in Chattogram. Due to this commercial and industrial development, and rapid urbanization, the landcover of the CCC area has changed expeditiously which is responsible for the urban heatwaves hazard. The study intends to comprehend the future heat wave scenario. For a better understanding of heatwaves, it has been analyzed the temporal changing and relationship between the Land Surface Temperature (LST) and the Land Use & Land Cover (LULC) from 2000 to 2020. Based on this data, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Markov chain model (MC), and Cellular Automata (CA) models have been applied to the prediction of future LST and LULC in different two years, 2030 and 2040. The temporal analysis result shows that the LST of the CCC area has risen with the decrease of vegetated areas and water bodies. The model simulation result suggests that the total buildup area of the CCC will be increased around 45% and 60% in 2030 and 2040 respectively, and 13 and 43% of the CCC area will suffer temperatures higher than 36° C in 2030 and 2040, respectively which are considered to be more vulnerable to the people. Policymakers will find this research useful in interpreting the effects of LULC change on LST and in recommending management frameworks. It will also be favorable for analyzing future vulnerability in the CCC area due to heat stress.","Das, T.","Islam, M.I.","Raja, D.R.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Advances in Civil Engineering: ICACE 2022.

Row_134,"Understanding the mechanisms that influence land-use carbon emissions (LCE) and accurately predicting their performance is crucial for county-level cities to assess their urban development schemes and formulate lowcarbon strategies. However, previous studies have not thoroughly investigated the mechanisms and dynamic changes in LCE intensity (LCE per unit area) across various land-use types. In this study, we propose an approach based on a coupled STIRPAT-SD model to analyze the comprehensive mechanisms behind five land-use types and further forecast their LCE intensities and total carbon emissions. Subsequently, we apply this method to Changxing, a representative county in Zhejiang Province of China with high carbon intensity, using 15 years of historical data to systematically examine driving factors, future trends, and policy impacts on its LCE performance from 2005 to 2035. The results reveal substantial variations in values and dynamic characteristics of LCE intensities across the five land-use types. By simulating evolving trends under different scenarios, our findings demonstrate that the Low Carbon Development (LCD) scenario is most suitable for Changxing as it can potentially reduce carbon intensity per unit GDP by approximately 37% by 2035 compared to levels in 2020. This study proposes two applications of the coupled model method: firstly, assessing scheme-based carbon emissions at the plot level using LCE intensity values; secondly, formulating effective carbon reduction strategies at the county level through scenario simulation.

Row_135,"China has experienced rapid urbanization in the last few decades. In this context, housing demolition becomes a challenge involving people's livelihood during the process of urban renewal. As a legacy issue, the governance of informal housing is imminent. Small-property-rights housing (SPRH) refers to long-term, large-scale informal housing built on collectively owned land in China. Although Collectively Owned Land Price Assessment Guidance stipulates that SPRH cannot be demolished forcibly without compensation. However, Land Management Law states that compensation standards depend on local governments, resulting in unfair compensation. By integrating the first-difference model (FDM) and the boundary-fixed-effect model into the hedonic pricing model, this study proposes a model of demolition compensation of SPRH based on market value standard, which takes state-owned land compensation standard and residential land floor price into account. Using the case of Nanjing, this study estimates whether Xingdu Garden's demolition compensation deviates from a reasonable level. The results indicate that compensation is reasonable. Residents can take advantage of compensation to purchase affordable housing, and generous subsidies have significantly improved their living standards. FDM can also offer technical support for assessing the rationality of informal housing compensation.

In this paper, we considered Shanghai, China, as the study area and assessed its ecosystem service value (ESV) using the equivalence coefficient table method based on land use data from 2000, 2010 and 2020. Multi-scenario simulations of LUCC and ESV in 2030 were carried out by establishing a future land use simulation (FLUS) model. The results showed that from 2000 to 2020, the most obvious features of LUCC in Shanghai included an increase in built-up land (an increase of 1388.09 km2) and a decrease in cultivated land (a decrease of 1355.85 km2). Wetland, woodland and grassland maintained a steady growth trend. During these two decades, the ESV in Shanghai decreased from 322.8417 million yuan to 311.8970 million yuan. In terms of the spatial distribution of LUCC and ESV, coastal areas had the most frequent occurrence of LUCC and contributed the most to the ESV. The multi-scenario simulation results showed that there was a significant improvement in the ESV of the ecological priority scenario (2.01% and 4.06% higher than the benchmark scenario and development priority scenario, respectively). In addition, several policy recommendations for the development and utilization of land in coastal cities are proposed, and the significant contribution of coastal areas to the ecological benefits of coastal cities is empirically demonstrated.

Then, the value of crucial ecosystem services and the trade-offs or synergies between them are calculated for past and future periods. We find that urban expansion is dominated by the occupation of cropland and grassland, leading to the losses of ecosystem services. Especially under the economic priority (EP) scenario, food production may be reduced by up to 2.98 % and soil conservation may be reduced by up to 1.04 %. The directionality of the relationships between ecosystem services will not be reversed under any scenario. Our results also emphasize that although ecosystem services have been effectively protected under the ecological conservation (EC) scenario, it may increase the trade-off intensity among them.

Row_139,"Most existing cellular automata (CA) models impose strict requirements on the number and spatial distribution of samples. This makes it a challenge to capture spatial heterogeneity in urban dynamics and meet the modeling needs of large and complex geographic areas. This paper presents a CA model based on geographically optimal similarity (GOS) transition rules and similarly sized neighborhoods (SSN). By comparing the similarity in geographical configuration between samples and predicted points, the model enables a comprehensive characterization of the driving mechanism behind urban expansion and its self-organizing scope. This helps to mitigate the impact of sample selection and assumptions about spatial stationarity on simulation results. The performance of GOS-SSN-CA simulation was tested by taking the urban expansion in the Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan urban agglomeration in China as an example. The results show that GOS can derive more accurate and reliable urban transition rules with fewer samples, thereby significantly reducing spatial prediction errors compared with logistic regression. Moreover, SSN selects different neighborhood sizes to represent the difference between the local self-organizing range and surrounding cells, thus further improving the simulation accuracy and restricting urban expansion morphology. Overall, GOS-SSN-CA effectively characterizes the geographical similarity of urban expansion, improves simulation accuracy while constraining the urban expansion form, and enhances the practical application value of CA.","Li, Yinqi","An, Yue","Zhou, Zhou","Ren, Hui","Tan, Xuelan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES,urban growth,cellular automata,geographic similarity,model optimization,spatial nonstationarity,CONSTRAINED CELLULAR-AUTOMATA,GROWTH SIMULATION,MARKOV-CHAIN,MODEL,CONFIGURATION,AGGLOMERATION,SENSITIVITY,CALIBRATION,PREDICTION,WUHAN,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2024,Simulation of urban expansion using geographical similarity transition rules and neighbourhood sizes

The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was applied to perform high resolution simulations, and the results were compared against ground observations, weather radar data, and satellite-based precipitation estimates. The simulations tend to underestimate precipitation by an average bias of 55%; however, some experiments showed good fittings in terms of time correlations (over 90%). Overall, the radar vertical profile of reflectivity agrees with observations, where the height of the warm and mixed layers was accurately simulated, despite overpredictions of convective depth (by up to 3 km in regions of intense ascending currents). Typically, WRF was more sensitive to distinct microphysics schemes rather than cloud convection ones. Also, urban areas showed greater precipitation and hydrometeor content in comparison with non-urban ones, even under strong synoptic-scale forcing.

This study proposes a hierarchical model integrating land -use simulation and comprehensive benefit evaluation based on remote sensing data of land -use in the Hebei Province, China, between 2000 and 2019. It compares the ESV and subtotal ecological -economic product (SEP), which reflects comprehensive benefits under ten governance scenarios. The results revealed significant urban expansion, amounting to 7516 km 2 , with significant changes in cultivated land and grassland. The ESV increased from 89.2 to 134.6 billion USD from 2000 to 2019, with regulatory and support services as the primary types of ecosystem services. With single -element governance, the ESV and SEP of water area governance were higher than those of woodland and cultivated land. With multi -element governance, the ESV and SEP of governance focusing on water areas were higher than those focusing on woodland and cultivated land. Moreover, multi -element ecological governance was found to be superior to single -element governance. Ecological governance of water areas and woodland ensured higher comprehensive benefits, while avoiding risks caused by excessive changes in land -use structure. The lower ESV and ESP of other multiand single -element governance were primarily owing to two types of conversion: 1) grassland to woodland and cultivated land, and 2) water areas to cultivated land. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on the core elements of regional ecosystems and implement comprehensive ecological governance, address practical problems of land consolidation and ecological governance, and appropriately introduce market forces to realize the operation and management of the entire process and life cycle.

In this study, to identify the hydrothermal driving factors responsible for extreme precipitation in urban areas, sensitivity experiments were carried out on two extreme precipitation events in Shanghai, China, using the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model coupled with the artificial water dissipation urban canopy model (AWDUCM). The simulation results from the WRF model and observations from 35 weather stations across Shanghai were compared. The results showed that WRF could simulate the spatial distribution and precipitation intensity of extreme rainfall more accurately when integrated with the AWDUCM. With the AWDUCM incorporated, the root-mean-square errors of the two simulated precipitation events were 9.1 and 9.9 mm respectively (accounting for approximately 20% of the total rainfall). The near-surface temperature and specific humidity in the AWDUCM simulation were approximately 0.5.C and 1g.kg(-1) higher than in the NON simulation (that did not invoke the AWDUCM) respectively. Urbanization factors increase the near-surface temperature and specific humidity in urban and built-up land, and the results of this study indicate that these are two of the driving forces affecting precipitation.

Row_143,"The City of Cape Town (CoCT), South Africa faced a critical situation between 2015 and 2018 in which the municipal water supply was almost completely exhausted. This situation, commonly referred to as Day Zero in South Africa emanated from a decline in rainfall, resulting in one of the most severe droughts in history. The crisis was also aggravated by rapid population growth and urbanization. CoCT was on the verge of becoming the first city in the past decade to experience a complete cessation of water supply for urban and agricultural purposes. In addition to the effects of low rainfall and population surge, urban energy consumption and increased food demand impacted directly the available water resources. To evaluate the interlinkages between water utilization, water production, energy supply and demand, and food production and demand, this study employed a system dynamics modeling (SDM) approach. The model was developed as a stock and flow diagram utilizing Stella Architect and encompassed five interconnected nodes: water, energy, food, land, and population. The findings revealed that by the end of the 20 -year modeling period, the volume of accessible and stored water in all the major dams will be approximately 459 million cubic meters, with residential use accounting for about 85 % of urban water use and agriculture accounting for approximately30.37 % of total water demand. The model illustrates the impacts of precipitation rate, runoff, and evaporation on variables such as land -use change and population dynamics.

The results showed that between 1990 and 2030, UANSTM saw considerable changes in land use and an increase in construction land and cropland, reflecting the growing urbanization trend that will inevitably lead to the occupation of ecological lands, including forestland and grassland. Large fluctuations in the ESs were triggered by substantial changes in land use during the study period. According to the predicted results, the ES scenario had the smallest area of lowvalue land, which is consistent with the subsequent development status. Moreover, precipitation, slope, elevation, evapotranspiration, and NDVI on the four ESs type are also found to be major driving factors. Precipitation and NDVI are severely constrained by evapotranspiration, reflecting the characteristics of arid regions. Finally, we took good connectivity ecological patches are identified as ecological sources in ES scenario, Urumqi as the main ecological core, proposed the ecological optimization pattern of UANSTM from the viewpoint of ""point and line to plane"" and advocated for the ""multi-core, nine districts, eight belts, and one road"" to advance the development of the ""Silk Road Economic Belt"".

Row_145,"Urban rivers have been proved to be the hot spots of atmospheric methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. However, the rivers across rural-urban interface, which are undergoing significant environmental changes in the process of urbanization, received little attention. In this study, we conducted seasonal investigations in two small suburban rivers in mountainous southwest China, to clarify the spatial-temporal characteristics of CH4 and N2O concentrations and fluxes in relation to watershed land use change and their potential controls. The results showed that, the small suburban rivers acted as strong CH4 and N2O emitters to atmosphere with averaged fluxes of 960.2 +/- 966.6 and 205.1 +/- 240.8 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1), respectively. The concentrations and fluxes of CH4 and N2O presented a sharp increase and spatial variability when the rivers cross the rural-urban interface. Such discontinuous spatial pattern of CH4 and N2O emission in river continuum were closely related to watershed land use, and could be modeled as functions of the urban land use proportion. The urban land proportion in the basins could explain 70% and 59% of the total spatial variations of CH4 and N2O emissions, respectively. Stepwise multiple regression models (SMRM) based on water environment parameters were established in our study and indicate that DTC, NH4+, NO3-, TP and conductivity play key controls on CH4 and N2O emissions in the two studied mountainous suburban rivers. Moreover, SMRM and urban land use based functions were tested to have good predictions based on constrained mountainous samples, could provide a possible path to extrapolate CH4 and N2O emissions in mountainous urbanized-rivers at the whole regional network scale. We also found evidences for the sewage-dominated tributary with abnormally high CH4 and N2O concentrations, which was partially responsible for the sharp increase of CH4 and N2O fluxes in urban reaches. The results of structural equation model provided strong evidence for direct and indirect controls of urban expansion on longitudinal differentiation of riverine CH4 and N2O emissions crossing rural-urban interface. We argued that CH4 and N2O emissions from rivers in the mountainous rural-urban area are sensitive to the watershed urbanization and water pollution, and suggested that land use management, nutrient and organic matter control can be promising avenues to mitigate riverine CH4 and N2O emissions.","Que, Ziyi","Wang, Xiaofeng","Liu, Tingting","Wu, Shengnan","He, Yixin","Zhou, Ting","Yu, Lele","Qing, Zhaoyin","Chen, Huai","Yuan, Xingzhong",,,,,,,,,13,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,CH4 and N2O,Watershed urbanization,Land use change,Sewage load,Spatial and seasonal variation,NITROUS-OXIDE EMISSIONS,CARBON-DIOXIDE,METHANE EMISSIONS,GREENHOUSE GASES,DISSOLVED METHANE,REGIONAL-SCALE,NETWORK,CO2,DYNAMICS,FLUXES,,,,,,,,,,,APR 2023,Watershed land use change indirectly dominated the spatial variations of CH4 and N2O emissions from two small suburban rivers
Row_146,"The directional variation in upwelling thermal radiance (known as 'thermal anisotropy') affects our understanding of urban land surface temperature (LST) from remote sensing observations. Parametric models have been proposed to quantify and potentially correct the thermal anisotropy from satellite systems. The accurate specification of the coefficients is critical for broadening applications of parametric models. However, the current research is limited to only one study area or one particular approach which often does not sufficiently offer transformative understanding for effective applications over other metropolitan areas. This study focuses on systematically evaluating schemes that determine the model coefficients. We use a geometric model to simulate Urban Thermal Anisotropy Time-series (GUTA-T) and propose different approaches to determine the physicallyinterpretable parameters. The model and solution schemes reduce the uncertainties caused by observational errors and simplifications of complex urban surfaces. The three schemes include estimating parameter values using component urban surface temperatures obtained from model simulations (Scheme #1mod) or field observations (Scheme #1obs) ('forward' approach), inverting parameter values from known anisotropy (Scheme #2) and from multi-angular LST observations (Scheme #3) ('backward' approach). The three schemes were separately evaluated and compared to an independent airborne dataset. These schemes have consistent results. The root mean square errors (RMSE) between LST anisotropy from the three schemes and airborne measurements are ranked as: Scheme #3 (1.0 K) < Scheme #2 (1.2 K) < Scheme #1 (based on field data) (1.3 K) < Scheme #1 (based on TUF3D simulation) (1.5 K), whereas the overall amplitude of the variation of directional temperature averaged over the 5 flights is 11.9 K. The inverted parameter values from the three schemes agree well with the results from field measurements. The three schemes have advantages and disadvantages, and are expected to be combined depending on the available input data. These schemes represent multiple options to quantify and/or correct the anisotropic impact from remote sensing LST for urban applications.","Wang, Dandan","Hu, Leiqiu","Voogt, James A.","Chen, Yunhao","Zhou, Ji","Chang, Gaijing","Quan, Jinling","Zhan, Wenfeng","Kang, Zhizhong",,,,,,,,,,4,REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT,Thermal infrared remote sensing,Thermal anisotropy,Land surface temperature,Urban areas,Parametric model,GUTA-T,ENERGY-BALANCE MODEL,LOCAL CLIMATE ZONES,SURFACE-TEMPERATURE,ANGULAR VARIATIONS,GEOMETRIC MODEL,EMISSIVITY,ACCURACY,SUPPORT,IMPACT,AREAS,,,,,,,,,,JAN 1 2024,Simulation of urban thermal anisotropy at remote sensing pixel scales: Evaluating three schemes using GUTA-T over Toulouse city
Row_147,"Populated urban areas along many coastal regions are vulnerable to landfalling tropical cyclones (TCs). To the detriment of surface parameterizations in mesoscale models, the complexities of turbulence at high TC wind speeds in urban canopies are presently poorly understood. Thus, this study explores the impacts of urban morphology on TC-strength winds and boundary layer turbulence in landfalling TCs. To better quantify how urban structures interact with TC winds, large-eddy simulations (LESs) are conducted with the Cloud Model 1 (CM1). This implementation of CM1 in-cludes immersed boundary conditions (IBCs) to represent buildings and eddy recycling to maintain realistic turbulent flow perturbations. Within the IBCs, an idealized coastal city with varying scales is introduced. TC winds impinge perpendicu-larly to the urbanized coastline. Numerical experiments show that buildings generate distinct, intricate flow patterns that vary significantly as the city structure is varied. Urban IBCs produce much stronger turbulent kinetic energy than is pro-duced by conventional surface parameterizations. Strong effective eddy viscosity due to resolved eddy mixing is displayed in the wake of buildings within the urban canopy, while deep and enhanced effective eddy viscosity is present downstream. Such effects are not seen in a comparison LES using a simple surface parameterization with high roughness values. Wind tunneling effects in streamwise canyons enhance pedestrian-level winds well beyond what is possible without buildings. In the arena of regional mesoscale modeling, this type of LES framework with IBCs can be used to improve parameters in surface and bound-ary layer schemes to more accurately represent the drag coefficient and the eddy viscosity in landfalling TC boundary layers.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This is among the first large-eddy simulation model studies to examine the impacts of tropical cyclone-like winds around explicitly resolved buildings. This work is a step forward in bridging the gap between engineering studies that use computational fluid dynamics models or laboratory experiments for flow through cities and mesoscale model simulations of landfalling tropical cyclones that use surface parameterizations specialized for urban land use.","Rozoffx, Christopher M.","Nolan, David S.","Bryan, George H.","Hendricks, Eric A.","Knievel, Jason C.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY,Boundary layer,Atmosphere-land interaction,Coastal meteorology,Hurricanes/typhoons,Large eddy simulations,SURFACE WINDS,HURRICANE,PREDICTION,MESOSCALE,FLORIDA,FLOWS,CFD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2023,Large-Eddy Simulations of the Tropical Cyclone Boundary Layer at Landfall in an Idealized Urban Environment
Row_148,"Urbanization intensifies urban heat and compromises thermal comfort. However, few studies have examined the interactions of Urban Heat Island (UHI) between neighboring cities and the impacts of expanding satellite towns on central urban areas (CUA). We conducted a series of WRF/BEP-BEM simulations during a summer heat wave in Fuzhou, China, to understand how extensive urbanization and complex topography affect thermal comfort. Control runs reveal an intense UHI centered on Fuzhou's CUA. Comparisons with scenarios where urban land use and terrain are altered demonstrate that urbanization degrades thermal comfort citywide by elevating heat stress while valley -basin topography worsens midday heat but alleviates nighttime humidity. The urban heat island circulation above the CUA suppresses the valley wind circulation and prevents the sea breeze front from advancing inland in the afternoon. Notably, CUA urbanization enhances sea breezes in a satellite town, inducing afternoon ""cool islands"". Interactions between CUA and satellite towns appear minimized, with urbanization impacts confined locally. Future expansion according to the ""Fuzhou 2035"" Master Plan shows negligible effects on thermal comfort in CUA. Our findings enhance understanding of intra-urban UHI dynamics in complex terrains.

Row_151,"Monitoring urbanization processes is important because they are often accompanied by intensive landscape pattern transitions and pluralistic socioeconomic changes. To effectively monitor urban expansion and support regional planning, it is essential to develop a fast, accurate and universal urban-rural classification model, especially identifying the dynamic spatial patterns of urban, urban-rural fringe and rural areas. Although deep learning can effectively detect land cover changes, its applications in urban-rural identification have received little attention due to a lack of high -quality training datasets. In this study, we develop a novel transferable full resolution convolutional neural network (FR -Net) to identify urban -fringe -rural areas. A large-scale training dataset was constructed using field surveys and aerial photography, and a data cube was stacked by multiple typical socio-natural indicators. We took the Beijing -Tianjin -Hebei (BTH) urban agglomeration region in China as a case study and identified spatiotemporal evolutions of urban -fringe -rural areas from 2000 to 2020. The results indicated that over the past two decades, the urban-rural fringe expanded outward with urban areas, and both areas gradually increased, with an inverted U-shaped growth rate. Accurate identification of these fringes can benefit regional urban-rural planning and social governance. Based on the identification results, complex socioecological impacts of urbanization could be further explored. Testing demonstrated that the developed FR -Net model has high accuracy and robustness. Our developed open -source FR -Net model exhibits transferability and can be applied to multi -scale urbanized areas.","Wang, Chenrui","Sun, Xiao","Liu, Zhifeng","Xia, Lang","Liu, Hongxiao","Fang, Guangji","Liu, Qinghua","Yang, Peng",,,,,,,,,,,2,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,Urban -fringe -rural identification,Urban expansion,Urban -rural planning,Convolutional neural network,Deep learning,LAND-USE,ECOSYSTEM SERVICES,EXPANSION,URBANIZATION,TIANJIN,CHINA,MODEL,DYNAMICS,IMPACTS,AREA,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2024,A novel full-resolution convolutional neural network for urban-fringe-rural identification: A case study of urban agglomeration region

A WRF-based single-layer urban canopy model (SLUCM) was validated for the greater Salt Lake City area (GSLA) using measurements from two weather stations for a one-week period during summer 2019. A baseline model based on current GSLA properties developed using the Noah land surface model, SLUCM, and refined urban classifications based on WUDAPT Local Climate Zones (LCZs) produced acceptable predictions and computational times. The baseline model was validated using measured meteorological data and clearly showed diurnal heating patterns. Three scenarios representing multi-decade growth were defined by modifying LCZs in different parts of the GSLA. Compared to baseline values, results showed increased urban density increased local nighttime temperatures 5-10 degrees C depending on the extent of growth, but did not affect daytime temperatures. This was due to changes in LCZ anthropogenic heating rates and sky view factors which were most noticeable during early nighttime hours, consistent with atmospheric heat island behavior.

This study aims to identify the LULC change's impact on the Hodna basin (26,000 km2) from 2000 to 2020 using Landsat images data and forecast the possible change scenarios to the horizon of 2050. The Maximum Likelihood Supervised Classification (MLSC) was applied to Landsat data between 2000 and 2020 with a five-year interval. The confusion matrix of image classification indicates an overall accuracy of 85% and a kappa coefficients range between 0.82 and 0.96. To forecast the possible change scenarios of each class of LULC a transitional simulation using an artificial neural network (ANN) and machine learning algorithms. While, the cellular automata (CA) algorithm was used to simulate and predict the future LULC for the years 2030, 2040 and 2050 after validation of 2020 LULC map. The overall kappa calculated is 68.5% indicating a good accuracy of the validation process.

Row_154,"Agriculture, as a widespread high-intensity land use activity in urban surroundings, may dramatically alter urban climate through advection and atmospheric feedbacks. However, it remains unclear how and to what extent agriculture warms or cools the urban temperature. This study investigated the potential impacts of rural croplands on summer and winter urban heat island (UHI) effects in three most developed urban agglomerations (JJJ, Jing-Jin-Ji; YRD, Yangtze River Delta; PRD, Pearl River Delta) of China by the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model. Results show that urban lands warm 2-m air temperature substantially relative to natural forests, with a mean intensity of 1.33-1.70 degrees C and the strongest in winter night of 2.99-3.07 degrees C, but one to two thirds of the warming are canceled by rural croplands, especially in the semi-humid JJJ. The cropland impacts depend strongly on the concurrent UHI effects, with the coupled effects (added impacts due to the UHI effect) are 2.0-8.7 times the independent effects (assuming no UHI effect), especially in the humid-hot PRD. Consequently, the rapid cropland loss for urbanization during 2000-2020 not only increases the UHI-affected area by 1.5-4.2 times, but also elevates the UHI intensity of existing urban lands, for example, by 0.43-0.65 degrees C in winter night. The cropland impacts on urban climate can be attributed to a range of factors like decreases in ground heat storage and net radiation, an increase in wind speed (turbulent heat mixing), and a change of planetary boundary layer height. Our results highlight the importance of rural agriculture in modulating urban climate and therefore in formulating the coordinated development plans of city clusters. However, the simulated cropland impacts differ greatly between near-surface air and land skin temperatures, and from the satellite-sensed radiant temperature, calling for field observations and more numeric experiments to elaborate the findings from this study.","Yan, Zhangmei","Zhou, Decheng",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY,Urbanization,Urban heat island,Cropland,Coupling effect,Urban agglomeration,WRF,PEARL RIVER DELTA,REGIONAL CLIMATE,SURFACE-TEMPERATURE,WEATHER RESEARCH,ISLAND,URBANIZATION,ENERGY,SIMULATIONS,CIRCULATION,IRRIGATION,,,,,,,,,,MAR 15 2023,Rural agriculture largely reduces the urban heating effects in China: A tale of the three most developed urban agglomerations
Row_155,"The process of sustainable urban development is accompanied by frequent and complex land cover changes, and thus, clarify accurate information on land cover changes can provide scientific data for urban management. To characterize urban development at an accurate spatiotemporal scale, a change detection model is not only required to provide accurate location (Where) and time (When) of the changes, but also semantic information on the change types (What). Accordingly, this study proposed a deep learning method for temporal semantic segmentation change detection (TSSCD) that obtains information on the where, when, and what of changes simultaneously. TSSCD model bridges the semantic gap between remote sensing time series abrupt changes and land cover changes by learning the month-to-month mapping from spectral information to land cover types. We implemented a temporal semantic segmentation model based on the most classic fully convolutional network, where all two-dimensional convolutions and pooling operations were replaced with one-dimensional. We conducted tests on the TSSCD in several urban study areas, and it consistently exhibited good accuracy. In most cases, it outperformed the BFAST and CCDC algorithms, except when only a single spectral band was used. Simultaneously, we analyzed the minimum data requirements for training a TSSCD. The TSSCD currently faces challenges in achieving strong generalization beyond the training data distribution. Additionally, we observed that change detection for specific land cover types can be achieved through the flexible configuration of TSSCD. Finally, we explored a method for constructing datasets using existing products to minimize data annotation efforts, yielding promising results. However, there is still some gap compared to complete manual annotation. Overall, the TSSCD model provided a novel solution to accurately characterize sustainable urban development at the spatiotemporal scale.","He, Haixu","Yan, Jining","Liang, Dong","Sun, Zhongchang","Li, Jun","Wang, Lizhe",,,,,,,,,,,,,9,REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT,TSSCD,Change detection,Remote sensing,Urban expansion and renewal,Sentinel-2 time series,Deep learning,FOREST DISTURBANCE,CLASSIFICATION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 1 2024,Time-series land cover change detection using deep learning-based temporal semantic segmentation

We find that urban form factors jointly account for 31.32 % of the predictive power in estimating transportation carbon emissions after controlling for transport facilities, socioeconomic, and demographic factors. Urban polycentricity and transportation carbon emissions generally exhibit an obvious and complex nonlinear relationship.

This is paradoxical and unsustainable considering water scarcity in drylands, which is exacerbated by climate change. Thus, it is critical to better understand why and how dryland urbanization and water scarcity are decoupled so that sustainable measures can be designed. Focusing on the Phoenix Metropolitan Area (PMA) of the United States, we addressed the following questions: 1) What are the relative influences of water and economic factors on urbanization in recent decades? 2) Which linkages connecting water storage to urban development have been decoupled? and 3) How can water availability and development be better coupled to improve regional sustainability? We tested the relationships between economic factors, water availability, and urbanization, with Pearson Correlation Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling. We found that, from 1986 to 2019, urban population growth and urban land expansion in the PMA were driven by economic factors, and not influenced by fluctuations in water supply. We identified specific broken linkages among water storage, water deliveries, municipal water supply, and urbanization, which must be coupled to enforce water availability constraints on urban expansion in the context of climate change.

The expansion of these grey areas contributes to heat wave events and an overall increase of average temperatures in specific regions due to their high reflectance properties. This study focuses on analyzing the heat island phenomenon resulting from urban growth and vegetation change over the past 30 years (1990-2020) in three key districts, namely Sheikhupura, Chiniot, and Pakpattan, located in the Punjab province. Landsat data is utilized to assess the urban heat island (UHI) effect caused by land cover changes in these regions. The maximum likelihood classification method is employed to classify remote sensing data, enabling the identification of heat islands based on surface emissivity. The UHI has main influence on built-up land areas therefore, to forecast future scenarios of LULC and their impact on LST, the study employs cellular automata (CA) modeling and incorporates several spatial variables to predict LULC for the year 2050. Four primary land cover classes, namely vegetation including cropland, built-up, water, and barren land, are utilized to examine temperature differences across different land cover types, aiming to understand the impact of land cover changes on temperature patterns. The findings also indicate that barren land and urban areas exhibit the highest thermal reflectivity, contributing significantly to increased surface temperatures. Over the past three decades, the surface temperature has risen by 1.65 degrees C in Chiniot, 0.86 degrees C in Sheikhupura, and experienced a slight decrease of - 0.04 degrees C in Pakpattan. The temperature decrease in Pakpattan can be attributed to a substantial reduction in barren land, which has been converted into agricultural and urban areas. This indicates a negative correlation between land surface temperature (LST) and vegetation cover. The changes in land use and land cover (LULC) in the study area are found to be relatively insignificant.","Raza, Danish","Khushi, Mudassar","Shu, Hong","Aslam, Hasnat","Saleem, Muhammad Sajid","Ahmad, Adeel","Mirza, Sahar","Saeed, Urooj","Khan, Sami Ullah",,,,,,,,,,1,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,Vegetation change,Urban growth,Maximum likelihood classification,Cellular Automata,Spatial correlation,LAND-SURFACE TEMPERATURE,URBAN HEAT-ISLAND,IMPERVIOUS SURFACE,USE/LAND COVER,INDEX,URBANIZATION,VEGETATION,DISTRICT,IMPACT,CLASSIFICATIONS,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 2024,CA-ANN based LULC prediction and influence assessment on LST-NDVI using multi-temporal satellite images

However, only a few existing studies have focused on the applicability and limitations of commonly used land-use/cover change (LUCC) simulation models in lake wetland landscapes. Taking Shengjin Lake Reserve in China as the study area, we firstly analyzed landscape variations during 2010-2020 using multisource remote sensing images. Then, the patch-generating land-use simulation (PLUS) model was employed to simulate wetland landscapes in 2020, the accuracy and limitation of which in simulating lacustrine wetlands were also explored. Lastly, the changing trends of wetland landscapes in 2030 under different development scenarios were predicted. The results show that the landscape of Shengjin Lake Reserve has changed significantly during 2010-2020, with increases in mudflats, reservoirs/ponds, woodlands, and built-up land, and there has been decreases in lakes, grass beaches, and croplands. The PLUS model demonstrated an ideal simulation accuracy for Shengjin Lake Reserve, with the overall accuracy exceeding 80%, kappa coefficient greater than 0.75, and figure of merit (FOM) coefficient of 0.35, indicating that the model can capture the dynamic changes in wetland landscapes accurately. The simulation accuracy can be effectively improved with the adjacent initial year, shorter time interval, and the primary driver factors. Under the natural development scenario, the number of patches in the Shengjin Lake Reserve increased sharply, and landscape fragmentation intensified. Under the urban development scenario, the expansion of built-up land increased, and the average patch area increased. In the ecological protection scenario, the Shannon diversity index and Shannon evenness index of the landscape improved significantly, and the natural wetlands such as grass beaches and lakes can be protected effectively. Our study confirms the applicability of the PLUS model in simulating and predicting lacustrine wetlands landscapes, and the conclusions provide a scientific basis for formulating reasonable development strategies to realize wetland resource conservation and management.","Zheng, Zonghong","Wang, Jie","Ni, Jianhua","Cui, Yuhuan","Zhu, Qiang",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,REMOTE SENSING,lacustrine wetlands,PLUS model,multi-scenario simulation,landscape pattern,driving force,CELLULAR-AUTOMATA,COVER,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2024,"Lacustrine Wetlands Landscape Simulation and Multi-Scenario Prediction Based on the Patch-Generating Land-Use Simulation Model: A Case Study on Shengjin Lake Reserve, China"

Row_163,"Heat released from the energy consumption in buildings (QB) is an important component of anthropogenic heat, which is a major contribution to the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon. However, it is still a challenge to integrate all the available data to improve the estimation of QB due to inconsistences among multiple data sources. This paper presents a solution to estimate the anthropogenic heat from buildings in Singapore by classifying the buildings into the electricity consumption sectors based on a random forest classification model using multiple data sources. The classification model achieves a cross-validation accuracy score of 95% by using building use type, land use type of land parcel where the building stands, location and area as predictors. Based on the classification result, the annual average QB from the commercial buildings (CS), Housing and Development Board (HDB) apartments, private apartments and condominiums (AC), and landed properties (LP) were estimated to be 12.1, 4.4, 3.2 and 1.1 W m- 2 on a 200 m-by-200 m grid, respectively. QB was approximately 9% of the net all-wave radiation in Singapore in 2015.

Row_164,"Urban land surface temperature (ULST) is one of the core parameters in monitoring the urban thermal environment, which has received extensive attention in several study and application areas. Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing technology can efficiently observe large-scale land surface thermal radiance information and is a critical approach used to obtain ULST quickly. Traditional LST retrieval algorithms are conducted using the classical radiance transfer equation (RTE) based on the assumption that the land surface is flat, which may be challenging to hold for complex urban landscapes. Moreover, with the improvement of the spatial resolution of remote sensing images, the influence caused by the geometric structure will be more obvious. Various urban thermal radiance transfer (URTE) models have been proposed and successfully applied to TIR remote sensing images with tens of meters spatial resolutions, such as Landsat, ECOSTRESS, and Gaofen-5. Current airborne TIR sensors can observe remote sensing images with ultrahigh spatial resolution (sub-meter). In this paper, using the ensemble learning method based on the ultrahigh spatial resolution urban thermal radiance transfer model (UHURT), a new retrieval algorithm is developed to estimate the LST directly from the observed brightness temperature (BT). The proposed new algorithm applies to ultrahigh spatial resolution remote sensing images. It has the end-to-end advantage of not relying on atmospheric parameters or land surface emissivity, known as in traditional algorithms, thus avoiding the limitations due to the lack of available input data. Validation results based on the simulation dataset showed that the proposed algorithm has higher theoretical accuracy than the traditional split-window (SW) algorithm. As the sky view factor (SVF) decreases, the accuracy advantage becomes more pronounced, growing from 0.149 K (SVF = 1.0) to 1.085 K (SVF = 0.25). The application results in the remote sensing image also indicated that the results of the proposed algorithm (RMSE = 2.093 K) are more accurate than those of the SW algorithm (RMSE = 2.490 K), and the correlation between the resultant error and building density is lower, which can accurately reduce the geometric effect to obtain the ULST better.","Ye, Xin","Ren, Huazhong","Wang, Pengxin","Duan, Yanhong","Zhu, Jinshun",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS,Geometric effect,radiance transfer equation (RTE),thermal infrared (TIR),ultrahigh spatial resolution,urban land surface temperature (ULST),LAND-SURFACE TEMPERATURE,EMISSIVITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024,Urban LST Retrieval From the Ultrahigh Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Data

Therefore, forecasting the trend of urban expansion and providing a reasonable urban planning basis for government departments have become the focus of researchers. An artificial neural network (ANN) can be used to consider spatial nonstationarity when obtaining the changing characteristics of urban land types. Therefore, in this study, we use cellular automata (CA) based on ANN (ANN-CA) to simulate and forecast urban expansion and discuss the parameter sensitivity of the model in detail. In addition, we propose a new Urban Expansion Early Warning Indicator system to warn about the deterioration of future land distribution patterns. Chengdu is selected as the study area, and the study period is from 2000 to 2020. The results showed the following: (1) The best accuracy was achieved when the neighborhood size is 7 x 7 and the number of model iterations is 250, and overall accuracy (OA), Kappa coefficient, and figure of merit (FOM) are 91.47%, 0.855, and 0.354, respectively; (2) ANN-CA is more suitable for predicting the urban expansion of Chengdu than CA based on logistic regression (LR-CA) and CA based on decision tree (DT-CA).

To identify spatial 'hot spots', in which ET, and thus watershed hydrology, are most pronounced in response to land use change so that limited watershed landscape management resources can be applied efficiently.MethodsThis process-based research quantified spatial patterns of ET and other energy fluxes in a rapidly urbanizing rice paddy-dominated watershed, Qinhuai River Basin (QRB), using a spatially explicit land surface energy balance model (SEBAL).ResultsThe QRB experienced a rapid land use change in urban-rural interface (URI) area, resulting in a significant reduction in actual ET (- 9.4 mm yr(-1)) but a significant increase in sensible heat (3.71 W m(-2) yr(-1)) and soil heat fluxes (0.85 W m(-2) yr(-1)) during the growing season from 2001 to 2019. The change in energy partitioning at the watershed scale was dominated by URI area identified as the 'hot spots' of ecohydrological change within a heterogeneous basin.ConclusionsKnowledge gained from this study improves parameterizing distributed watershed ecohydrological models (e.g., ET processes) to guide urban planning.

Nevertheless, few assessments have quantified how future urban flood risk mitigation capacities evolve under various urban expansion and climate change scenarios. This study simulates urban expansion of major cities across China using future urban-regional environment simulation model at 30-m resolution under shared socioeconomic pathways scenarios (SSP). Concurrently, future precipitation intensity changes are assessed based on climate projection data. Finally, the urban flood risk mitigation capacity impacted by urban expansion and climate change is evaluated using the soil conservation service model. The results reveal: (1) The sizes of major cities are projected to expand 30% by 2050, and the north and east China are primary urban growth poles.

Based on the grid-level data in Nanjing, China, this paper explores the spatially heterogeneous effects of PTA on road traffic CO2 emissions using a geographically weighted random forest (GWRF) model. A simulation-based counterfactual analysis framework is further proposed to predict the intervention effects of improving PTA. Two kinds of practical interventions, adding facilities and increasing service frequency, are considered in our counterfactual prediction. The effects of improving PTA across different areas are predicted and compared. Our results indicate that the GWRF model with a properly tuned bandwidth outperforms the conventional random forest model. The results of counterfactual analysis show that improving PTA could achieve greater environmental benefits in suburb areas. With the process of urbanization in Nanjing, the population and economy has grown rapidly in suburb areas. Therefore, it is reasonable to improve public transport services in these areas. Based on our findings, PTA has potential to make a significant contribution to sustainable development of urban transportation.

This research integrates remote sensing inversion and numerical simulation to investigate the annual cycle of the GSCI in Huachong Park, Hefei City. Initially, 59 remote sensing images from various seasons between 2010 and 2020 were retrieved using Landsat series image data and atmospheric correction methods to invert Land Surface Temperatures(LST), which preliminary identified the GSCI's annual cycle variations. Subsequently, meteorological data for Hefei from 2010 to 2020 were extracted using the Solar Terms Typical Meteorological Day(STTMD) method to obtain representative annual meteorological data. These data were then input into the ENVI-met software for numerical simulations of the study area, capturing diurnal variations of the cold island effect at 24-time points and predicting annual changes in cold island intensity. The results indicate that: (1) The GSCI exhibits an annual cycle and seasonal variations characterized by ""strong in summer and weak in winter, cooler in summer and warmer in winter""; (2) A progressive relationship exists between remote sensing inversion and ENVI-met numerical simulation in studying the temporal variation of the GSCI, with the integration of these methods yielding a more comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis of the GSCI over long-term scales;(3) The STTMD method effectively simplifies representative meteorological data, progressively combining remote sensing retrievals and numerical simulations to facilitate the acquisition of comprehensive spatiotemporal variations of the green space heat effect over extended periods.

Row_171,"Urban overheating poses a serious threat to human health. An insight into the daytime urban thermal characteristics in different built-up areas is crucial for mitigating and adapting to urban overheating. In this study, we apply the WRF model with the BEP-BEM urban scheme to simulate the thermal environment of built-up areas in five representative Chinese cities during heatwave events. By employing high -resolution urban land use/land cover data based on local climate zone (LCZ) classification, we aim to examine the heterogeneous nature of the urban thermal environment. Air temperature and heat stress metrics are employed to describe the thermal environment. The model results are validated by meteorological data with a high correlation coefficient and a low centralized root mean square error of air temperature, indicating good model performance. The results indicate that air temperature is higher in compact areas (i.e., LCZ1 and LCZ2) and lower in open and sparse areas (i.e., LCZ9 and LCZ6), similar to many observational and simulation results. Meanwhile, heat stress metrics that consider both air temperature and humidity reveal minimal variation among different LCZs. When temperature, humidity, and wind speed are all considered, the heat stress metric presents characteristics that are analogous to the air temperature pattern. We further analyze the factors (i.e., anthropogenic heat, thermal parameters, and geometrical parameters) that contribute to air temperature differences between LCZs and find that anthropogenic heat and geometrical parameters are the primary contributors. Anthropogenic heat accounts for nearly three fifths of the total difference, and geometrical parameters account for more than two fifths, while thermal parameters have little effect. These findings could assist municipal planners design appropriate mitigation strategies to reduce the effects of urban overheating and create a more habitable urban environment.","Liu, Zhuo","Yuan, Hua","Dong, Wenzong","Liu, Yingying","Zhang, Yizhou","Li, Xianxiang","Xiang, Jiayi","Lin, Wanyi","Shi, Jiahao","Dai, Yongjiu",,,,,,,,,0,URBAN CLIMATE,Local climate zone (LCZ),Thermal environment,Heat stress,WRF,Anthropogenic heat,Urban parameters,IMPLEMENTATION,INTEGRATION,WUDAPT,SYSTEM,TOOL,WRF,LCZ,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 2024,Assessing daytime discrepancies and key factors in urban thermal environments: A local climate zones-based modeling study in five Chinese cities
Row_172,"Both urban land cover (ULC) change and anthropogenic heat (AH) emission are important causes of urban heat island, but their relative contributions to the changes in urban precipitation and the related mechanism remain unclear. Based on numerical simulations utilizing the latest realistic urban fraction and AH data over the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration, we found that ULC and AH resulted in nearly opposite effects on precipitation. Various dynamical and thermodynamic processes were involved according to the atmospheric moisture budget analyses. AH increased precipitation particularly during afternoon, and the increases were stronger during heavy precipitation events because of the enhanced moisture convergence effect together with the release of moisture storage previously accumulated in the atmosphere. Differently, ULC reduced mean precipitation mainly due to suppressed evaporation. During weak precipitation events, the suppressed evaporation was largely balanced by the intensified moisture convergence, but during heavy events, ULC caused more pronounced precipitation reduction because the moisture convergence response disappeared and failed to offset the evaporation effect. The relative contributions of different dynamical and thermodynamic processes such as those related to circulation, moisture gradient, and background moisture availability to the temporal variation in the total moisture convergence were further quantified. Overall, our results help better understand the relative roles of different aspects of urbanization on precipitation, and suggest that compared to ULC, reduction in AH emission that is tightly related to the energy consumption structure could be more efficient for mitigating the risk of extreme precipitation.Urban land cover (ULC) change and anthropogenic heat (AH) emission are two main causes of urban heat island, but how they would modify urban precipitation are still unclear. Here, based on numerical simulations utilizing the latest urban fraction and AH data over the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration, we found that ULC and AH can result in nearly opposite effects on precipitation. AH increased precipitation via intensifying moisture convergence, which was more pronounced during heavy precipitation events. Differently, ULC caused reduction in the mean precipitation due to the limitation in surface evaporation, but the disappeared moisture convergence response that failed to offset the suppressed evaporation was the main reason for the stronger ULC effect on precipitation during heavy precipitation events.

Row_173,"""Eastern Economic Corridor"" is a development plan under the Thailand 4.0 scheme to revitalize the economy. However, it has influenced the environment through numerous infrastructural and industrial projects. The ecological environment is the most fragile component since it is susceptible to land use, land cover changes (LULCC) and rapid development. Meanwhile, there is currently a lack of comprehensive studies on spatial heterogeneity and future simulation of ecological environment quality (EEQ). Therefore, this study aims to analyze changes in EEQ and controlling factors and to predict near-future EEQ by adopting an integrated approach of remote sensing and spatial analyses. It revealed that the regional EEQ has considerably fluctuated in the period 2013-2021. The dynamic areas, accounting for nearly half of the area, include ecologically degraded areas in coastal urban and surrounding areas and ecologically improved areas in the eastern forest and perennial plantations. Chonburi is the most vulnerable province due to its long coast with extensive urban infrastructures and industrial estates. These changes are an integrated consequence of natural and socioeconomic impacts. Particularly, LULCC, infrastructural projects, and climate are the most crucial contributors since they directly regulate the functions of the ecological environment, which will amplify the future changes of EEQ reflected via the near-future prediction. This research identified key controlling factors and spatial heterogeneities that are useful for policymakers and local authorities to have appropriate local-oriented plans for each area relevant to their uniqueness. Besides, regional plans should be also considered along with regional concerns such as LULCC, crop structures, water management, and green infrastructure, as well as legal interventions to promote sustainable development in this special economic zone.","Nguyen, Can Trong","Kaewthongrach, Rungnapa","Channumsin, Sittiporn","Chongcheawchamnan, Mitchai","Phan, Thanh-Noi","Niammuad, Damrongrit",,,,,,,,,,,,,7,LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT,eastern economic corridor,ecological environment,future prediction,land use and land cover changes,spatial heterogeneity,special economic zone,sustainable development,AIR-POLLUTION,INDEX,LAND,CORRIDOR,FEATURES,IMPACT,AREA,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2023,A regional assessment of ecological environment quality in Thailand special economic zone: Spatial heterogeneous influences and future prediction

Analyses of observational data indicate rainfall rates (RR) in a 45 degrees annulus sector 50-100 km downwind of the city are enhanced relative to an upwind area of comparable size. Enhancement of mean precipitation intensity in this annulus sector is not observed on days with spatially averaged RR > 6 mm/day. Under some flow directions, the probability of cREF >30 dBZ, occurrence of hail, and the probability of CTH >10,000 geopotential meters are also enhanced up to 200 km downwind of DFW. Two deep convection events that passed over DFW are simulated with the Weather Research and Forecasting model using a range of microphysical schemes and evaluated using RADAR observations. Model configurations that exhibit the highest fidelity in these control simulations are used in a series of perturbation experiments where the areal extent of the city is varied between zero (replacement with grassland) and eight times its current size. These perturbation experiments indicate a non-linear response of Mesoscale Convective System properties to the urban areal extent and a very strong sensitivity to the microphysical scheme used. The impact on precipitation from the urban area, even when it is expanded to eight-times the current extent, is much less marked for deep convection with stronger synoptic forcing. Plain Language Summary Urban areas are rapidly expanding and have the potential to strongly influence the local and regional climate. Long-term warm season observations near Dallas-Fort Worth show higher rainfall intensity and hail frequency 50-100 km downwind of the city, but those days with the heaviest precipitation are not enhanced by the city.

Row_176,"Small urban areas, due to their specificity (high anthroposphere, multiple forms of land use, variable drainage conditions), are often overlooked in studies on soil erosion and sediment transport that predominantly focus on a large scale. The sediment yield from such small urban areas may greatly vary depending, for example, on the state of the land development. Therefore, its proper estimation is crucial for water resources management, improving urban runoff quality or designing and maintaining local retention ponds. In this study, two different approaches were applied to estimate sediment yield from a small urban catchment of Sluzew Creek, located in Warsaw, Poland. While the first was based on direct hydrological measurements and field samples, the second (indirect) used various empirical formulas to predict bed load transport (local formula of Skibinski) in the stream channel and the suspended sediment delivery from the catchment (USLE equation, Build-up/Wash-off model). The sediment load established according to the direct approach equals 714 Mg/year, of which 83 Mg/year results from the bed load transport and 631 Mg/year comes from the suspended sediment transport. The total sediment load calculated according to the indirect approach equals 579 Mg/year. The relative difference in loads calculated with these two methods is about 20%. This paper combines various established methods into a novel composite analysis of sediment yield. The methodology presented in this study may support the estimation of sediment load in small urban catchments with a heterogenous land use structure.

As such, this study presents a methodological proposal to analyze urban sprawl, negative environmental impacts, and land degradation. The methodology employed involves a combination of remote sensing data, environmental modeling techniques, and mixed-method analyses of environmental impacts from 1991 to 2018. Analyzed variables included vegetation, surface temperature, water quality, and soil degradation within the study area. These variables were assessed based on an interaction matrix used to evaluate environmental impacts (low, medium, or high impacts). The obtained results show conflicts of land use and land cover (LULC), a lack of urban sanitation infrastructure, and an absence of environmental monitoring and inspection. A reduction of 24 km(2) of arboreal vegetation was observed from 1991 to 2018. High values of fecal coliforms were found in March across nearly all analyzed points, indicating a seasonal discharge of effluents. The interaction matrix presented various negative environmental impacts, including increased land surface temperature, soil degradation, inappropriate solid waste disposal, devastation of remaining vegetation, water pollution by domestic effluents, and the incidence of erosive processes. Ultimately, the impact quantification determined that the study area has a medium degree of significance in terms of environmental impacts.

Clarifying the spatial correlations of the interactive relationship between urbanization and land use, along with their spatiotemporal dynamics, is of vital importance for addressing the complex interplay between urban development and land resources and identifying regional differences. However, previous studies have not sufficiently explored these issues. Herein, we introduce a coupling coordination degree (CCD) model and present the results of exploratory spatiotemporal analyses involving in-depth investigation of the CCD between urbanization quality and land-use intensity in 290 Chinese cities. The results demonstrate that the CCD for most cities was at the transition-period or basic-coordination stage. The dynamics of the spatial correlation of the CCD was found to increase from the east to the central and western regions, but this was found to decline overall. The movement direction and spatial dependence of the local spatial structure of the CCD exerted a dominant synergistic effect. The transition of the spatial correlation was mainly Type I (stable local and neighboring morphology), showing strong transfer inertia, path dependence, and locking features. Dynamic transitions occurred more in central and eastern cities. The results suggest that more cross-city cooperation could contribute to moderate land-resource exploitation for high-quality urbanization.","Xu, Feng","Wang, Huan","Zuo, Danyu","Gong, Ziqiang",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES,urbanization quality,land-use intensity,coupling coordination degree,spatiotemporal evolution,spatial correlation,cities,DYNAMIC SIMULATION,ENVIRONMENT,INDICATORS,EXPANSION,CITIES,REGION,MODEL,CITY,,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 2024,How does the coupling coordination relationship between high-quality urbanization and land use evolve in China?

However, in recent decades, the increasing scarcity of available flat land has compelled many cities to expand to sloping land (sloping land urbanization, SLU), and the understanding for global SLU is still unclear. This study, based on the currently available high-precision global Digital Elevation Model (FABDEM) and global land cover dataset (GlobeLand30), investigated the characteristics and impacts of SLU in 26,402 urban residential areas worldwide from 2000 to 2020. Results show that the total area of SLU globally is 16,383 km2, accounting for 9.54 % of the overall urban expansion. This phenomenon is widespread globally and relatively concentrated in a few countries, with 42.78 %, 24.35 %, and 21.83 % of the area coming from cultivated land, forest, and grassland respectively. Global SLU has accommodated 34.78 million urban population, and indirectly protected 8922 km2 of flat cultivated land, while causing a net loss of 4373 km2 of green ecological land.

Row_181,"Prediction and monitoring of urban sprawl is a significant urban issue for planners, decision makers, and local authorities in terms of spatial data, strategies, and prediction models. Egyptian cities have expanded rapidly in the last 40 years. This uncontrolled urban growth requires a review of Egyptian urban policies and regulations. The Greater Cairo Region (GCR) is Egypt's economic capital and a significant industrial and commercial city. This study uses spatio-temporal data to suggest an approach based on integrating cellular automata (CA) and multicriteria evaluation (MCE) like analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and running it within the geographical information system (GIS) for monitoring, analyzing, and allocating informal growth in the context of unplanned regions like the GCR. At first, the weights of influencing growth factors were determined and calculated using AHP. Next, the probability map was created according to AHP weights. The historical probability map was then generated based on the historical development. Then a standalone CA macro was developed based on AHP weights to calculate the proximity index for existing urban and transportation features using Moore's extended neighborhood matrix. Finally, the general suitability map was created to identify the most sensitive areas for growth over the next two decades. The prediction process was performed based on the 2012 urban boundary. Then, the prediction accuracy was verified using the Kappa coefficient based on actual urban extents in 2017. The results showed that 676 km2 (35%) of the study area was not sensitive, 386.5 km2 (20%) was slightly sensitive, 522 km2 (27%) was almost sensitive, and 348 km2 (18%) was extremely sensitive to urban sprawl. Finally, we predicted the urban growth for the period from 2022 to 2052 for every 5 years. The outcomes showed a linear scattered sprawl pattern along transportation features and an annular pattern around existing urban spaces. Therefore, fertile farming land and natural resources in the GCR are set to become almost extinct over the next two decades, threatening food production and security. These results indicate the necessity to modify the region's urban policies to protect the agricultural areas and control the unplanned urban sprawl.","Badwi, Ibrahim M.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT,Urban growth,Urban modeling,Land suitability,Multicriteria evaluation (MCE),Analytical hierarchy process (AHP),Cellular automata (CA),Geographical information system,Egypt,URBAN-GROWTH,CELLULAR-AUTOMATA,SIMULATION,MODELS,GIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 1 2024,"Integrated Multicriteria Approach for Assessing Land Suitability and Predicting Informal Growth: The Case of the Greater Cairo Region, Egypt"
Row_182,"In order to balance the interests of land finance participants and maintain the stability of their capital chain, this paper combines the two levels of local government debt financing and real estate development, incorporates local governments, real estate developers, urban residents and commercial banks into a unified analytical framework, systematically constructs a behavioral game evolution model of the four core participants to analyze the stability of the equilibrium points and the system stability strategies. Meanwhile, the numerical simulation is used to explore the impact of parameter changes on the behavioral game evolution trend and risk profile of each participant. The results show that: (1) The land transfer revenue and other costs of investing in local development have greater impacts on the strategic choices of local governments than the cost of land-transferring, and excessively low land transfer revenue and high costs of investing in local development will trigger a series of financial risks, which is not conducive to the systemic stability. (2) The rise in commercial banks' lending rate will increase the difficulty of real estate developers' capital turnover, so that they have to bear the risks of loan default, delay in construction and so on, however, improving the autonomous repayment rate of real estate developers can alleviate it. (3) The cost of house purchase and the benefits from quality resources acquired by urban residents from purchasing a house have different degrees of influence on the strategic choices of urban residents and work in opposite directions, so the relationship between the two factors should be adequately balanced to help urban residents avoid risks such as increased pressure in life. (4) The probability of commercial banks choosing the ""lending to real estate developers"" strategy is positively correlated with real estate developers' autonomous repayment rate and commercial banks' lending rate, and the inappropriate value of the two may lead to credit risk.

Predicting future land use change under the coupled framework of shared socioeconomic pathways and representative concentration pathways (SSP-RCPs) was a crucial step in devising sustainable development strategies. In this study, the patch-generated land use simulation (PLUS) model coupled with SSPRCP scenarios (SSP126, SSP245, SSP585) was used to predict land use changes from year 2020 to 2060, identify key management regions for balancing the goals of ecological protection and food security, and propose corresponding measures. The results showed that, (1) the selected driving factors and model parameters effectively simulated land use changes with an Overall accuracy of 0.95, a Kappa coefficient of 0.92, a Figure of Merit of 0.16, an Exchange error <= 5.69 %, a Shift error <= 1.04 %, and a Quantity error <= 0.67 %. (2) All the scenarios, it was observed that the grassland continued to decrease by 0.86 % to 7.34 %, and the forest and built-up land continued to increase, of which forest increased by 2.34 % to 4.03 %, and built-up land increased by 21.02 % to 61.08 %.

(3) In future scenarios, the expansion of built-up land has escalated the risk of cropland and grassland loss. Based on the distribution of key land use conversions, four categories of prioritized land management regions and corresponding measures have been proposed. This provided a potential pathway to mitigate risks associated with the protection of cropland and ecological land.

Row_184,"The vision of achieving ""carbon neutrality"" has created new requirements for the projection of land use and land cover (LULC), as well as the carbon storage (CS) of terrestrial ecosystem. Global-scale LULC scenario assessments with coarser resolution introduces uncertainties to national and regional-scale studies, which in turn has a negative impact on CS analysis based on land use perspective. Therefore, we proposed a new framework for scenario-based assessment that integrates the global-scale Land Use Harmonization (LUH2) dataset, Patchgenerating Land Use Simulation (PLUS) model, and Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model, which we called LUH2-PLUS-InVEST (LPI) model. Our aim is to investigate the potential impacts of the combinations of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) on China's future LULC and CS. By calibrating the demands, we generated structural predictions that were consistent with the actual land use. Furthermore, we explored the spatial heterogeneity of potential land use changes using 500 m x 500 m downscale simulations. Additionally, we developed a quantitative evaluation of CS from a spatiotemporal perspective and made recommendations on potential ecological threats. Our findings indicate that the basic characteristics of LULC and CS are determined by the natural context and that the prospects of land use distribution and carbon sequestration capacity are influenced by global emission pressure, regional competition, and China's unique development pattern.

Compared to previous studies, the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways and Representative Concentration Pathways (SSPsRCPs) scenarios provide a comprehensive framework for integrating climate and socioeconomic factors, offering deeper insights into future cultivated land dynamics. Taking the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) as the study area, we developed localized SSPs-RCPs scenarios and adopted Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) and Future Land Use Simulation (FLUS) model to simulate cultivated land changes under multiple scenarios. The findings indicate that cultivated land is predicted to decrease under all scenarios, with the SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0 scenarios showing the highest and lowest decrease of 39.24% and 8.32%, respectively. By 2050, the loss of cultivated land in the upper reaches is expected to be significantly greater than that in the middle and lower reaches. Furthermore, grasslands, forests, and urban areas are the main types of land that replacing cultivated land in the YREB. The hotspots of cultivated land loss are in mountainous areas such as Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. Additionally, the gravity center of cultivated land distribution moved along the southeast to northeast, with the center of gravity shifting from Guizhou to Hunan under scenarios SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5.

Previous empirical studies have confirmed that landscape patterns inextricably linked with the thermal environment, but static results based on a single temporal cross section of image data provide only a partial understanding. In this paper, we constructed a dynamic framework using Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) for temperature simulation and Geodetector to study the landscape factors and their interactions that influence near-surface temperature (NST) changes in the Guanzhong Plain Urban Agglomeration (GPUA) between 2000 and 2020. Results showed that the GPUA average NST increased by 0.012 degrees C and 0.053 degrees C in January and July from 2000 to 2020, respectively. In terms of the dynamic correlation between landscape patterns and NST, cropland (CPL) was negative, urban land (UBL) was positive, and the remainder of the landscapes differed in winter and summer. Furthermore, results from the Geodetector showed that UBL embodied a stronger influence in summer than during winter months. This finding helps to explain why the average NST increase is higher in summer than during winter. The Dynamic Q values (DQ) of the area-based landscape metrics were generally larger than those of other spatial configuration metrics, and the interaction results showed that the landscape metrics of various land-cover classifications were enhanced, indicating that the superposition effect among landscape metrics needs to be taken into account in landscape planning in addition to area factors.

This research proposes a novel and integrated approach to GI planning that responds to evolving urban contexts and encompasses the operational mechanisms of services at multiple scales. We first assess the spatial mismatch between GI service supply and demand using standard spatial analytical approaches. We then project scenariobased futures to highlight future mismatch or exacerbated mismatch issues.

Our approach involves a dynamic spatial simulation of urban growth and the quantification of GI services over space and time.

Based on a systematic research path of ""pattern-mode-coordination-sustain -ability"", this study quantified the urban expansion dynamics of BRI countries and 80 representative cities from 2000 to 2018 using multi-source remote sensing data and the Global Atlas of Urban Expansion. The results show that in terms of dynamic rules, the share of urban lands grew from 0.32 % in 2000 to 0.66 % in 2018 (an increase of 250,600 km2) and is estimated to increase to 1.68 % in 2018-2030. Countries in developing regions (i.e., West Asia, North Africa, and Southeast Asia) are predicted to become the new high-value centers of urban expansion intensity (UEI). The UEI of BRI cities showed a significant developing region orientation and ""high in the east and low in the west"" distribution pattern but would gradually shift towards a spatially homogeneous and discrete distribution. BRI cities can be divided into four expansion modes (center-periphery, double-winged strip, dual -core cluster, and single-winged mutation expansion), each with a different evolutionary dynamic mechanism. Regarding coordination, there is a great demand for land expansion by population and economic growth in BRI cities. This dependence increased as the city's UEI index rose; when the UEI exceeded 3 %, the dependence became more pronounced. The investigations also showed that the adverse ecological effects of urban land expansion are gradually increasing at the urban scale. Furthermore, the ecological impacts of population growth are usually the strongest for BRI's countries and cities, and the intensity showed a synergistic growth trend with the UEI index. This study provides new insights into the dynamic features of BRI's urban expansion from national to urban scales and historical to future periods, while also contributing new perspectives from the BRI to optimal global land management and sustainable urban development.","Wei, Guoen","He, Bao-Jie","Sun, Pingjun","Liu, Yaobin","Li, Ruzi","Ouyang, Xiao","Luo, Kang","Li, Shuoshuo",,,,,,,,,,,40,CITIES,Urban expansion,Expansion pattern,Ecological effects,Simulation prediction,"""The Belt and Road"" initiative (BRI)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2023,Evolutionary trends of urban expansion and its sustainable development: Evidence from 80 representative cities in the belt and road initiative region

In this study, we evaluated the spatiotemporal evolution pattern of landscape ecological risk (LER) in the Loess Plateau from 2010 to 2020. This was examined under the driving mechanism of human and natural dual factors. We combined the random forest algorithm with the Markov chain to jointly simulate and predict the development trend of LER in 2030. From 2010 to 2020, LER on the Loess Plateau showed a distribution pattern with higher values in the southeast and lower values in the northwest. Under the interaction of human and natural factors, annual precipitation exerted the strongest constraint on LER. The driving of land use and natural factors significantly influenced the spatial differentiation of the LER, with a q-value >0.30.

Row_198,"Over the past century, rapid urbanization has greatly altered landscapes and affected atmospheric conditions causing impacts across a wide range of sectors including human welfare, infrastructure, and ecosystems. As a result, there is a growing imperative to improve understanding of urbanization impacts on local and regional weather events and hydroclimates. This study investigates how urbanization affects precipitation and cloud fraction (CF) in the vicinity of Indianapolis. We employ multi-month simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting model to: (a) assess the impact of an urban area on precipitation and CF, (b) quantify how this impact varies with urban growth, and (c) examine the main mechanisms through which the city alters the local hydroclimate. Specifically, two perturbed simulations, where the urban land cover is either replaced by croplands or is increased in size, are also performed for the two rainiest months. Comparisons of the control run with no city against the perturbed runs indicate statistically significant impacts of the urban area in enhancing precipitation amounts, frequency and low-level CF, particularly within the first 100 km radius downwind of the city boarder. The urban environment is found to increase precipitation efficiency over the city and in downwind regions. Temperature at 2 m height, planetary boundary layer height, turbulent kinetic energy, and convective available potential energy, are also enhanced in the perturbed runs and drive changes in vertical mixing, downwind precipitation amounts, frequency and low-level height CF. All these changes appear to be a non-linear function of the city size.Over the past century, rapid urbanization has reshaped landscapes, influencing atmospheric circulation, and leaving profound impacts on human welfare, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Recognizing the urgency to comprehend these effects, this study contributes to an improved understanding of the influence of urbanization on precipitation amounts and cloud fraction (CF) in the surrounding areas of a metropolitan area in the United States. This work utilizes a modeling approach based on an ensemble of simulations of the Weather Research and Forecasting model. The design of our modeling experiment allows us to investigate the role of different degrees of urbanization and to decouple the urban signature from the background climate in terms of precipitation and cloud properties. Our findings reveal a statistically significant increase in low-level CF and precipitation, particularly within the first 100 km radius downwind of the city border. Further, we identify a non-linear relationship between size of the urban area and the associated changes in precipitation amounts, frequency, and CF.Urban areas may modify the regional climate by altering cloud fraction (CF), rainfall patterns, and rain efficiency Statistically significant increases in downwind low-level CF, precipitation amounts, intensity, and frequency are identified Urban areas enhance turbulent mixing, convective available potential energy and rain efficiency, over the city, and in downwind regions","Moraglia, G.","Pryor, S.

Row_199,"Rapid global urbanization has perturbed ecosystem structures and functions, resulting in ecological risk and threatening sustainable human well-being and socioeconomic development. However, scientific indicators to analyze ecosystem service (ES) risk patterns need to be explored in detail. In addition, studies on ES supply risk are stagnating on historical or status explorations, especially from the view of disturbance from land-use changes. This study seeks to develop a framework for modeling past-future ES supply risk pattern evaluation and probing into ES risk patterns under different future land-use scenarios. To achieve this objective, the framework integrates the Future Land Use Simulation (FLUS) model, the Intelligent Urban Ecosystem Management System (IUEMS) model, and an established indicator system incorporating ES supply trend, hotspots and coldspots, and ES trade-offs, and synergies. The results show that: (1) In 2050, the supply of climate regulation in the Xi'an Metropolitan Area (XMA) will increase, while that of carbon sequestration and recreation will decrease. In 2050, the supply of climate regulation is the highest under ecological protection (EP) scenario, while the supply of carbon sequestration and recreation are the highest under cropland protection (CP) scenario. (2) From 2000 to 2050, the hotspots and coldspots of climate regulation increase in both natural development (ND) scenario and CP scenario. Notably, CP scenario experiences the most significant reduction in extremely significant hotspots and coldspots of carbon sequestration. From 2000 to 2050, at the regional and pixel scales, climate regulation and carbon sequestration mainly show trade-offs, and carbon sequestration and recreation show synergies. (3) ES supply risk in XMA is high in the center and low in the north and south. The ES supply risk from 2000 to 2050 is increasing, with expanding ""extremely high risk"", ""high risk"", and ""extremely safe"" areas. ES supply risk management should adhere to more strict land-use policies and guidelines, management zoning for areas with different levels of ES risk, and an accurate understanding of ES trade-offs and synergies for scientific risk management. This study could provide theoretical and technical references for ES risk assessment research and promote scientific ecological risk management.","Peng, Lixian","Zhang, Liwei","Li, Xupu","Zhao, Wudong","Liu, Yu","Wang, Zhuangzhuang","Wang, Hao","Jiao, Lei",,,,,,,,,,,2,LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT,ecosystem service,ecosystem service risk,hotspots and coldspots analysis,trade-offs and synergies,Xi'an Metropolitan Area,MANAGEMENT,DEMAND,CITY,PRIORITIES,DYNAMICS,PATTERN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 15 2024,A spatially explicit framework for assessing ecosystem service supply risk under multiple land-use scenarios in the Xi'an Metropolitan Area of China

Urban expansion induce variations in air pollutants are mainly determined by changes in meteorological conditions and atmospheric physicochemical processes. A persistent severe wintertime particulate pollution episode is simulated using the WRF-Chem model to investigate the impacts of land use/cover change on air quality in the NCP.

Row_201,"Over the past three decades, global urbanization and climate change have caused significant differences in climate conditions between urban and rural environments. The effects of global warming affect the climatic values in the urban area. The bioclimatic comfort in an area effectively chooses a site regarding the urban quality of life and activities. This study aims to predict the temporal and spatial changes of the bioclimatic comfort zones of Gaziantep province in terms of climate comfort in the context of long-term global scenarios. The future climate simulation maps were produced and analyzed comparing comfort conditions according to Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) 245 and 585 scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) Phase 6 (CMIP6). Spatio-temporal changes in temperature, humidity, and bioclimatic comfort areas were analyzed to inform these efforts according to Thom's discomfort index (DI) and effective temperature-taking wind velocity (ETv). The current situation of bioclimatic comfort areas to examine their synergy under extreme hot weather throughout the province and their possible concerns in 2040, 2060, 2080, and 2100 were modeled using ArcGIS 10.8 software.

Row_202,"Cellular automata (CA) models are effective tools for simulating future urban expansion. With the widespread use of high-resolution geospatial data for CA simulation, the computational intensity of CA models has increased. Additionally, due to the continuous development of CA modeling research, many scholars have made improvements to the models to enhance their simulation accuracy, resulting in an increasing computational complexity of the model. Consequently, the simulation task based on CA requires vast computing time and memory space. In recent years, deep learning (DL) has experienced rapid development. Many open-source DL frameworks support graphic processing unit (GPU) parallel computing and provide efficient application programming interfaces (APIs) that can be easily called to handle tasks of interest. In this study, a high-performance CA model was constructed based on the similarity between the neighborhood effect calculation process of the CA model and the convolutional process in a convolutional neural network (CNN). The convolution function in the DL library is used to calculate the neighborhood effect of the CA model to reduce the time and memory consumption of CA-based simulation. The experimental results show that compared with the conventional CA model, the execution time of the GPU-convolution-CA model proposed in this study has been reduced by more than 98%.","Zeng, Haoran","Wang, Haijun","Zhang, Bin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,TRANSACTIONS IN GIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2024,A high-performance cellular automata model for urban expansion simulation based on convolution and graphic processing unit
Row_203,"In the context of global urbanization, unplanned urban expansion renders cities particularly susceptible to the impacts of climate change, natural disasters, and extreme heat and humidity. Monitoring the land surface temperature (LST) in urban areas is crucial for assessing the urban thermal environment. Fine-scale (<100 m) LST products are essential for comprehensively understanding urban environments because of their detailed thermal distribution patterns. The Sustainable Development Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1), launched on November 5, 2021, possesses the capability to capture fine-scale urban LST imagery at a 30-m resolution, both day and night. Based on the characteristics of the SDGSAT-1 thermal infrared data, we implemented two methods (the multiband-based (MBB) method and the two-band-based (TBB) method) to generate 30-m urban LSTs. The derived LSTs are evaluated against the MODIS LST product and in situ measurements. Furthermore, various simulation datasets are constructed based on the spectral characteristics of SDGSAT-1/TIS and utilized to derive LSTs using the MBB and TBB methods to further clarify the feasibility of the two methods. The results indicate that the MBB method exhibits superior performance in urban areas, with an RMSE that is 0.74 K lower than that of the TBB method. In contrast, the TBB method is suitable in areas with lower emissivity fluctuations, such as dense vegetated areas, with an RMSE that is 0.96 K lower than that of the MBB method. These two methods are planned for incorporation into the SDGSAT-1 LST production framework, thereby contributing to the advancement of accurate LST retrieval and achieving sustainable development goals in the future.","Ouyang, Xiaoying","Sun, Zhongchang","Zhou, Shugui","Dou, Youjun",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT,Urban land surface temperature,Thermal infrared data,SDGSAT-1,Temperature and emissivity separation,Split window,EMISSIVITY SEPARATION ALGORITHM,HEAT ISLANDS,VALIDATION,SURFRAD,ASTER,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 1 2024,Urban land surface temperature retrieval with high-spatial resolution SDGSAT-1 thermal infrared data
Row_204,"Bioretention systems are increasingly used as a typical stormwater management measure due to their flexibility of scale and general aesthetic appeal. The main purpose of bioretention systems is to control runoff and their runoff reduction efficiency is affected by parameters such as contributing catchment area, fillings and sizes. Conventional analytical probabilistic studies on bioretention systems only considered saturation excess runoff for simplicity and may cause inaccuracy of estimating runoff. In this study, an analytical stochastic model (ASM) for bioretention systems considering both infiltration-excess and saturation-excess runoff generation processes was derived. The proposed ASM model was validated in a large number of case studies in Guangzhou, Jinan, and Lanzhou, China. Various climate, soil, dimension and land use conditions were investigated and compared. Close agreement was observed between the results obtained from the ASM model and continuous simulation results. The ASM model can be used to conveniently evaluate the runoff reduction efficiency of bioretention systems under different configurations of design parameters. It thus provides a computationally efficient analytical tool for the rapid design, analysis and evaluation of the nature-based solution to sustainable urban stormwater management.","Wang, Jun","Jia, Jingjing","Cao, Shengle","Diao, Yijiao","Wang, Jiachang","Guo, Yiping",,,,,,,,,,,,,5,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Stormwater management,Sponge city,Bioretention system,Analytical stochastic approach,Runoff reduction,WATER-QUALITY,HYDROLOGY,REMOVAL,PERFORMANCE,MITIGATION,MANAGEMENT,IMPACT,NUTRIENT,FATE,SOIL,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2024,A new analytical stormwater model for bioretention systems considering both infiltration and saturation excess runoff generation processes
Row_205,"This article evaluates the effect of depopulation, as a common trend in European countries and post-industrial cities, on the selected components of urban spatial structure, as an example of L ' odz ' (Poland). An integrated land use and transportation model was adapted and calibrated based on the available data in the study area and modeled the evolution of the city structure from 2020 to 2040. For the land use part, the spatial input-output concept and economic base theory are combined to compute the number of activities in the study area. First, the economic sectors (i.e., land, population, base, and service classes) are defined. Second, the production and consumption of each sector in L ' odz ' is calculated. Third, productions and consumptions are allocated to spatial units for determining the level of activities and flow between them. This process, which was programmed in Python, iterates until it reaches equilibrium in the activity system. For the transportation part, the PTV Visum simulator does the tasks of network representation and traffic assignment. Following the existing literature, changes in the distribution of employment, population, and land consumption within the activity system, along with trip length, trip production, and traffic loading in the mobility system, are regarded as urban structure factors and used for assessing the integrated model outputs. Getis-Ord and Theil's indices are also calculated to obtain the auxiliary results. Decentralization and dispersion in the spatial distribution of activities were iden-tified as the chief characteristics of the city form. As the population reduces in L ' odz ', the average land con-sumption and service activities per spatial analysis units drop in the simulation period, which lies in the correlation between population decline and the economic fall. In addition, depopulation leads to flattened spatial structure and lesser development intensity due to the scattered and de-intensified pattern of land consumption. Besides, the population shrinkage causes a decrease in inequality level by 60% and 25% from 2020 to 2030 and 2030 to 2040, respectively, which might root in the reduced and lower difference between population and service simultaneously. Moreover, computations showed that while the number of trips decreases, the trip length increases, which means after depopulation, people travel less between spatial units to fulfill their needs because the city shifts to the borderlines. Findings also assist decision-and policy-makers in recognizing the effect of population loss on L ' odz ''s spatial structure and offer implications of integrated models for addressing such phenomena.","Sahebgharani, Alireza","Wisniewski, Szymon","Borowska-Stefanska, Marta","Kowalski, Michal","Mokoei, Khashayar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,HABITAT INTERNATIONAL,Depopulation,Urban spatial structure,Integrated spatial model,Land use modeling,Activity -mobility pattern,URBAN-POPULATION,UNITED-STATES,SHRINKING CITIES,EUROPE,GROWTH,PERSPECTIVE,DECLINE,TRANSFORMATION,REGENERATION,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2024,"Analyzing the effect of depopulation on the spatial structure of the city of Lodz, Poland: Development and application of an integrated land use and transportation model"

Our study investigated the UHI effect and thermal heat stress of heat index (HI) in the U.S. cities of arid, continental, temperate, and tropical climate zones. A long-term simulation of the UHI and HI was conducted using Community Land Model version 5.0 from 1990 to 2014. The relationship between UHI and HI with climate and energy flux variables are analyzed with divided study periods (1990-2000 and 2001-2014) for the urban impact assessment. Higher sensible heat was reported, particularly in the arid and tropical cities. Further, temperate climate showed increasing annual trends for UHI and Delta HI (urban-rural difference of HIs). The later period (2001-2014) demonstrated greater UHI and Delta HI trends, implying a notable change in climate and urban expansion. The UHI, ranging from 0.73 degrees C to 2.07 degrees C, was more intense compared with Delta HI, at 0.14 degrees C to 1.23 degrees C. The UHI was positively correlated with temperatures in hot cities, while precipitation is the main driver in the continental city. For Delta HI, the relationship with temperatures were dominant in all climate zones.","Harmay, Nurul Syahira Mohammad","Choi, Minha",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,33,SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY,Urban heat island,Urban overheating,Thermal heat stress,Energy balance,United States,FLUX MEASUREMENTS,LOCAL CLIMATE,UNITED-STATES,WATER,BALANCE,IMPACT,TEMPERATURE,PHOENIX,DENSITY,COVER,,,,,,,,,,,APR 2023,The urban heat island and thermal heat stress correlate with climate dynamics and energy budget variations in multiple urban environments
Row_207,"Spatial constraints are fundamental to integrating the spatial suitability to urbanization into Cellular Automatabased (CA) urban growth models, but there is a lack of consensus on the optimal methods for this purpose. This study compared the performance of three probabilistic classifiers to generate suitability surfaces for CA-based urban growth models: Logistic Regression using Generalized Linear Model (LR-GLM), Logistic Regression using Generalized Additive Model (LR-GAM), and Random Forest (RF). The study also evaluated the sensitivity of these classifiers to the input urban map adopted as a dependent variable. For this analysis, seven maps were tested: the historical urban map containing the entire extent of the urban footprint, and six additional maps containing only the recently urbanized areas over timeframes ranging from one year up to two decades. The comparison evaluated the goodness of fit of the suitability surfaces and the spatial accuracy of the urban growth simulations, using five large Brazilian cities as case study areas. The results revealed that the RF classifier significantly outperformed the LR-based classifiers. However, this overperformance was more prominent when incorporating the new urban cells over the last one to two decades of growth as input urban maps. In addition, the sensitivity analysis of the input urban maps emphasized the benefits of calibrating the classifier using the recently urbanized cells rather than the historical urban extent. We consistently observed these results concerning classifiers and input urban maps across all five case study areas. Thus, the RF classifier combined with a training dataset containing the newly urbanized areas over at least the last 10 years systematically resulted in the suitability surfaces with the highest predictability among all tested scenarios.","Moroz, Cassiano Bastos","Sieg, Tobias","Thieken, Annegret H.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS,Random Forest,Logistic regression,Generalized additive model,Urban growth model,Cellular automata,LAND-USE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2024,Spatial constraints in cellular automata-based urban growth models: A systematic comparison of classifiers and input urban maps
Row_208,"Numerous scholars have warned that many cities in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) are threatened by severe flood risk, which is often underestimated. Considering this, we provide a scenario -based Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) approach to analyse the roles of adaptation strategies on the environment in response to climate change and flooding risk. Three strategies are proposed including a non -Nature -based Solutions strategy (non-NbS), and two Nature -based Solutions strategies (NbS 1.0 and NbS 2.0). The non-NbS strategy refers to the way of promoting urban development yet no additional environmental concerns. The NbS 1.0 strategy focuses on ensuring arable lands for food security, and the NbS 2.0 strategy acquires further regulations on ecology protection. The analysis consists of two steps. First, this paper simulates the land use scenarios in 2030 and 2050, respectively, following non-NbS and NbS (1.0 & 2.0) strategies. This process is developed based on a patchgenerating land use simulation (PLUS) model, which allows users to explore various future land use scenarios on account of different spatial development strategies, environmental conditions, and socio-economic trends. Second, the study overlays the land use scenarios with potential sea flooding scopes to reveal how different landscapes (e.g., forests and wetlands) are affected by carbon emissions in RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5. Further research is suggested to incorporate the 2020 GDP data to refine the findings of this study and consider the impacts of dykes on flood -prone area mapping. The analysis finds that the NbS (1.0 & 2.0) strategies play an active role in decreasing the future flood risk of built-up areas in the GBA regionally, especially under the high -emission RCP 8.5 projection. However, their impacts vary between cities. (1) The NbS 2.0 strategy is effective in reducing the risk of built-up areas in Shenzhen, Hong Kong, and Macao, while the effectiveness of the NbS 1.0 strategy is not apparent. (2) The NbS 1.0 and 2.0 strategies are both effective in Dongguan, Guangzhou, Huizhou, Jiangmen, Zhuhai, Zhaoqing, and Zhongshan in reducing the flood risk of built-up areas. In addition, the NbS 2.0 strategy is more productive than the NbS 1.0 strategy either in 2030 or 2050. (3) The NbS 1.0 and 2.0 strategies generate subtle different effects in Foshan in 2030 and 2050. The NbS 2.0 strategy is more productive in 2050, while less productive in 2030.

Previous studies have delineated UGBs from the perspective of ecological conservation or efficiency improvement and have widely applied them to spatial planning. However, few studies have investigated the role of urban interactions and connections in delineating UGBs, especially in rapidly developing urban agglomerations. Our study proposed a novel framework for UGBs delineation in urban agglomerations by coupling urban interactions and ecological conservation, with two innovative points. First, interurban interactions and connections were quantified to elucidate the transition rules of cellular automata (CA), and ecological conservation was configured as a constraint of the CA model. Second, the hierarchical generalized linear model (HGLM)-CA model was used to simulate the urban land pattern in 2035, and the dilation-erosion algorithm realized the final UGBs. The proposed framework was applied to UGBs delineation in the Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan (CZX) urban agglomeration, a rapidly developing urban agglomeration in China. Furthermore, a comparison among multi-scenario UGBs shows that urban interactions and connections can accelerate the clustering of urban development, and the delineated UGBs are more practical.

Remote sensing and statistical techniques were applied to estimate vegetation health, built-up area, impervious surface, water bodies, soil characteristics, thermal comfort, air pollutants (PM 2.5 , CH 4 , CO, NO 2 , SO 2 ), and nighttime light EPs. Regression assessment and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were applied to assess the relationships between urban expansion and EPs. The findings highlight the substantial growth of urban areas (0.067% - 0.14%), a decline in soil moisture (16% - 14%), water bodies (60% - 22%), a nationwide increase of PM 2.5 (44 mu g/m 3 to 73 mu g/m 3 ) and night light intensity (0.166 - 9.670) concentrations resulting in significant impacts on land, water, and air quality parameters.

Agent-based model (ABM) based on the modeling idea of ""bottom-up"" can offer the ability to simulate the complex individual behaviors that generate spatial population distribution. Previous ABMs were unable to be extended for simulation of spatial population distribution at a fine scale due to the shortage of fine characterization of the urban environment and the calibration of agents' behavior. This study filled these gaps by proposing a genetic algorithm-ABM (GA-ABM) for fine-scale simulation of spatial population distribution in a manufacturing metropolis. In this model, the employment and residential choice behaviors of agents were defined by the labor economic theory and discrete selection model. Multisource geospatial big data such as enterprise points-of-interest big data and building footprints data were used to finely characterize the labor market and urban environment to reflect the impact of agents' employment choices on their residential decision. Furthermore, the grid-scale population investigation big data were combined with the GA to calibrate the agents' residential decision behaviors. The proposed model was used in Dongguan, the typical manufacturing metropolis in China. As a comparison, the expert-experience-based method-ABM (EEBM-ABM) was also conducted by using the same data set. Through the comparison of the results produced by these two models, it was demonstrated that the model coefficient calibrated by GA could effectively reflect the agents' residential decisions. The calibrated GA-ABM is more capable than EEBM-ABM in simulating spatial population distribution in a manufacturing metropolis.

Its impact on rivers is of interest as it results in serious issues concerning geomorphic instability, ecosystem service reduction, and geo-hydrological risk increase. The present study provides a quantitative and qualitative assessment of landscape changes driven by urbanization, which occurred from the mid-19th century to the present day along the lower reaches of the Bisagno and Polcevera rivers and their tributaries in the Mediterranean coastal city of Genova (NW Italy). The bankfull channel morphological adjustments, the minor hydrographic network disappearance, the land use and land cover changes, and the current physical accessibility of river margins were investigated. This work is based on collection and review of historical data, photograph interpretation, GIS analysis, and field surveys. Urbanization essentially occurred between the mid-19th century and the late 1930s. The bankfull channel of the Bisagno and Polcevera rivers experienced large narrowing associated with widespread establishment of channelization structures. The minor hydrographic network essentially disappeared underground. After the 1930s, further minor anthropogenic interventions were implemented to accommodate urban expansion and consolidate channelization works; however, the overall geomorphological setting remained unchanged. The geomorphological evolution of the Bisagno and Polcevera rivers followed three different phases associated with the urban expansion process. Nowadays, the study area is completely urbanized, the fluvial stems flowing through the valley floor are totally disconnected from their adjacent areas, the main rivers show a relevant geomorphological stability induced by anthropogenic pressures, and the accessibility of river margins for people is rather limited. The outcomes from this study represent an essential knowledge base for technicians and policymakers to plan urban development and inform effective and sustainable management measures.

Row_214,"The urban expansion-induced heat can exacerbate heat stress for urban dwellers, especially during heat waves. With a focus on the intra-urban variability of urban heat islands (UHIs) and thermal comfort, the urban parameterization within the Community Land Model version 5 (CLM5) was modified incorporating the local climate zones (LCZs) framework, named CLM5-LCZs, to simulate the urban climate during a heat wave (HW) event in the summer of 2013. The evaluation of model performance demonstrated that it did a reasonable job of simulating surface energy balance and thermal regimes in cities against observational fluxes from a flux tower measurement site and temperatures from automatic meteorological stations in Nanjing, China. Then we investigated the characteristics and causes of UHIs associated with local background climate, intra-urban inhomogeneity and HW intensity in East China. The results exhibited that daytime and nighttime canopy urban heat island intensity (CUHII) were highest in the Compact Low Rise (LCZ3) and the Compact High Rise (LCZ1) areas, respectively, while surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) peaked in the Large Low Rise (LCZ8) and the Compact High Rise (LCZ1) areas during daytime and nighttime, respectively. Urban dwellers were easier exposed to serious heat environment in LCZ3 and LCZ1 areas over the north subtropical climate zone. Contrasts of CUHII and SUHII among different urban classes could exceed 1.7? and 5.4?. The intra-urban heterogeneity may alter the dominant factors controlling SUHII, which were also modulated by local climate and HW intensity. Unlike other controlling factors, the impact of local climate on the contribution from the urban-rural contrast of convection efficiency was larger than urban features. Overall, CLM5-LCZs displayed potential of implementing detailed simulations for inter- and intra-city UHIs at a larger scale, and enhancing the capabilities in modeling urban climate and exploring the causes and controls of UHIs.","Li, Congyuan","Zhang, Ning","Wang, Yongwei","Chen, Yan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES,urban heat islands,intra-urban variability,thermal comfort,heat wave,attribution,PARAMETERIZATION,IMPACT,ENERGY,SENSITIVITY,CITIES,WATER,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 27 2023,Modeling Urban Heat Islands and Thermal Comfort During a Heat Wave Event in East China With CLM5 Incorporating Local Climate Zones
Row_215,"Risk assessment, city planning, and emergency response are a few examples of potential applications of numerical simulations of scalar dispersion in urban environments. The complex flow fields and scalar dispersion are determined by the building layout and prevailing meteorological conditions that are highly uncertain. While the fidelity of a numerical model is important in providing an accurate prediction of flow and scalar fields, propagating the uncertain input through numerical models is imperative in those applications. However, it is uncommon to quantify input uncertainties due to expensive computational cost of high fidelity simulations such as large eddy simulations (LES) and Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS). In this work, the uncertain meteorological quantities viz., wind speed and its direction from field measurements are taken as inputs to RANS simulations that use realizable k - E turbulence model, to investigate their effects on passive scalar dispersion in central London. The mean wind and scalar quantities from RANS are initially validated with wind-tunnel data and compared to large eddy simulations (LES). For comparison with field measurements, the deduced probability density function (pdf) for wind speed and direction from the field are used as inputs for RANS simulations. For a 3-min averaged concentration at a specific receiver location, LES with unsteady wind inputs showed better performance than LES with mean wind input and RANS whereas for 30-min averaged concentration at various receiver locations, performance measures indicated that RANS is better than LES. The latter certainly suggests the importance of considering such uncertainties. The flow variability in every street is quantified using RANS simulations. This demonstrated that approximations used in a fast, low-order street network model may not be necessarily valid for every street of heterogeneous urban canopies, which in turn affects scalar prediction.","Boppana, Bharathi","Nguyen, Vinh-Tan","Wise, Daniel J.","Leong, Jason Yu Chuan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,ENVIRONMENTAL FLUID MECHANICS,DAPPLE,Dakota,Large eddy simulation,Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes,SIRANE,Wind-tunnel,POLLUTANT DISPERSION,WIND DIRECTION,MODEL SIRANE,FLOW,VALIDATION,SIMULATIONS,ARRAYS,RANS,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2023,Uncertainty quantification of inflow on passive scalar dispersion in an urban environment
Row_216,"Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter in many research fields. As a temperature characteristic, thermal radiation has an obvious directionality. In urban areas, the directional anisotropy (DA) in surface temperatures can reach 10 K during airborne measurements, limiting the applicability of urban surface temperature products. Notably, the intricate 3-D structures and heterogeneous temperature distributions in urban environments significantly influence this anisotropy. In recent decades, numerous models have been developed for urban thermal anisotropy (UTA) analysis; however, most of these models predominantly focus on horizontal surfaces, with little consideration of mountainous architectures. To balance the calculation efficiency and model complexity, this study introduces an analytical thermal anisotropy model applicable to urban areas. This model considers the effects of 3-D structures and slopes and is labeled as the AU3SM. The multiangle data used for the analysis are recorded by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with a multicircle observation scheme in Chongqing, China. Comparisons of the AU3SM simulated data with these measurement data yield root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R-2) values of 0.57 K and 0.89, respectively. Furthermore, similar comparisons with the discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model yield R-2 and RMSE values of 0.98 and 0.12 K, respectively. Simulations reveal that slope influences the UTA, and the hotspot lies on the opposite side of the solar direction; ignoring slope values of 5 degrees, 10 degrees, 15 degrees, and 25 degrees results in UTA maximum biases of approximately 1.2, 3.5, 7, and 7.5 K, respectively, under certain conditions. These findings demonstrate that the proposed model can accomplish rapid UTA assessments in mountainous areas.","Sang, Xinguang","Luo, Xiaobo","Cao, Biao","Bian, Zunjian","Fan, Tengyuan","Mu, Shilin",,,,,,,,,,,,,0,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING,Land surface temperature (LST),thermal infrared (TIR),urban 3-D,urban thermal anisotropy (UTA),Land surface temperature (LST),thermal infrared (TIR),urban 3-D,urban thermal anisotropy (UTA),LAND-SURFACE TEMPERATURE,RADIATIVE-TRANSFER,ANGULAR VARIATIONS,GEOMETRIC MODEL,DIRECTIONALITY,EMISSIVITY,AIRBORNE,PRODUCT,CROP,,,,,,,,,2024,An Analytical Thermal Anisotropy Model for the Urban Canopy Over Sloping Terrain
Row_217,"Land management policies and their spatial planning are crucial factors leading to the rise of future habitat risks. However, the differences in future habitat risks under various spatial policies and their combinations remain unclear, and there is a lack of targeted measures to manage these risks in China's territorial spatial planning. The study developed a feasible framework to tackle this issue. Eight future land use scenarios were simulated based on the combination of land management policies and spatial planning data, and then the habitat risks associated with each scenario were evaluated. Moreover, the study quantified habitat risk variations across diverse scenarios by examining the spatiotemporal changes in risk centers and their associated risk values. Lastly, the study identified critical risk zones based on the assessment results of risk levels and suggested relevant control strategies. The study area chosen was Hainan Island, a region experiencing rapid urbanization and possessing significant ecological resources. The results suggest that while development plans mitigate habitat loss, they accelerate the movement speed of the risk gravity center by up to 5 times. Under the implementation of farmland protection policies, the overall risk levels exhibit a noticeable increase, with the risk level at the center of gravity rising by up to 3.5 times. Implementing ecological protection red lines reduces the transfer rate of habitat risk centers by at least 0.4 times but generally leads to increased habitat risk levels.

Row_218,"Rapid urbanization in China led to widespread land-use conflicts (LUCs), requiring understanding the spatiotemporal patterns and mechanisms to support the high-quality development (HQD). This study evaluated the evolution and association mechanisms of LUCs and HQD in Chinese counties from 2000 to 2020 by developing a theoretical framework comprising of land-use structural conflict (SC), functional conflict (FC), HQD, and their relationship, based on the geographically weighted regression models, a coupling relationship matrix, and change scoring methods. Results show that the average HQD improved (12.85% change rate) and LUCs reduced (-3.63%) simultaneously, mainly contributed by FC reconciliation (-9.33%). SC was correlated with FC (average R2 = 0.13, p < 0.05), which directly and significantly affected HQD (average R2 = -0.16, p < 0.05). Furthermore, comprehensive land-use conflict had significant positive and negative effects on HQD in the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins, respectively (p < 0.1). Additionally, coupling relationships between LUCs and HQD would affect subsequent changes, particularly from 2000 to 2010, counties with low-middle FC and HQD tended to shift to low-high. Finally, four geographic area types (i.e., urban agglomeration, high-intensity agricultural, ecological functional, and ecologically fragile areas) with unique LUCs affecting HQD mechanisms were identified.

Row_219,"Urban morphology severely affects the intra-urban heat flux transport and thus directly regulates urban thermal environment. Despite previous studies suggested that urban morphology may significantly contribute to land surface temperature (LST), few studies simultaneously discuss the effects of urban morphology on LST in different urban units, particularly in the irregular block scale. Here, we explored the relationships between multi-dimensional urban morphology and LST using the eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model and the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method. Especially, we revealed the interaction of the urban morphological metrics on LST at the block (i.e., irregular size delineated by roads) and the grid scale (i.e., a regular grid size with 200 x 200 m). The results show that the contributions of urban metrics on LST follow the rank of 3D building metrics >2D landscape metrics of impervious surface (IS) > 2D landscape metrics of urban green space (UGS). Average building height (AH) and the percentage of landscape of IS (PLAND_IS) are the most important metrics at the block and the grid scale, respectively. Moreover, some metrics have specific thresholds of the warming or cooling effects, e.g., the cooling effect when AH exceeds 19 m and warming effect when PLAND_IS >49%. Finally, we found that the interaction effects of 3D-3D metrics pairs are stronger than that of 2D-3D metrics pairs. These findings provide useful information for understanding the driving mechanism of the 2D and 3D urban morphology on LST and optimizing the urban morphology for mitigating the urban heat islands effect.","Yuan, Bo","Zhou, Liang","Hu, Fengning","Wei, Chunzhu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15,URBAN CLIMATE,Urban heat island,Interaction effects,XGBoost,SHAP method,Sustainable development goals,HEAT-ISLAND,LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE,REGRESSION,PATTERN,COVER,HETEROGENEITY,URBANIZATION,SIMULATION,INDICATORS,VEGETATION,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2024,"Effects of 2D/3D urban morphology on land surface temperature: Contribution, response, and interaction"

This study examines impact of land use and land cover (LULC) changes on nitrate nitrogen, outflow and surface runoff in the agriculture catchment in the Polish Carpathians using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The study covers 25-year (1995-2019) and was divided into three periods relating to different LULC patterns (1995-2004, 2005-2012, 2013-2019). The LULC maps used were based on aerial photos from 1997, 2009, and 2016. The SWAT was calibrated and applied to periods with variable LULC (in simulation 1) and by keeping the LULC constant during the period 1995-2019 (simulation 2; the LULC from 1997) to determine the impact of LULC changes on the analysed variables. The ongoing LULC changes were found to have resulted in a reduction of cultivated land area (by 72 %) and an increase of grassland (by 45 %), forest (by 2 %) and urbanised areas (by 17 %). The SWAT model achieved reasonable accuracy. The model results tend to overestimate the load of nitrate nitrogen and underestimate outflow and surface runoff. The LULC changes resulted in a decrease in outflow between 1995 and 2004 of 24 % in comparison to 2013-2019, and a decrease in surface runoff of 12 %. At the same time, there was a significant decrease in nitrate nitrogen load of 68 % (from 13.0 kg ha � 1 in 1995-2004 to 4.2 kg ha-1 in 2013-2019). If the LULC of 2013-2019 was restored to 1997 conditions (as in simulation 2), the outflow and load of NO3-N would be higher by 16 % (12 % in simulation 1) and 67 % (55 % in simulation 1) in relation to the observed values. The impact of LULC on the analysed parameters was spatially differentiated between subbasins depending on the scale of the land use changes. The research conducted here indicates that planning and managing the effects of LULC changes is of key importance for sustainable development in terms of the quantity and quality of water.","Kijowska-Strugala, Malgorzata","Bochenek, Witold",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,GEOMORPHOLOGY,Land use and land cover changes,Nitrate nitrogen load,Outflow,Surface runoff,SWAT model,Carpathians,LONG-TERM IMPACT,SURFACE RUNOFF,CLIMATE-CHANGE,NITROGEN,COVER,QUALITY,UNCERTAINTY,TRANSITION,PARAMETERS,MANAGEMENT,,,,,,,,,,AUG 15 2023,Land use changes impact on selected chemical denudation element and components of water cycle in small mountain catchment using SWAT model

This study focused on examining the collective impacts of urbanization and this extreme heatwave on Paris's thermal environment. To achieve this, high-resolution simulations were performed using the urbanized version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The inclusion of enhanced urban canopy parameters and improved spatial resolutions significantly improved the near-surface meteorological variables and the spatial-temporal patterns of the urban heat island in Paris. The impervious surface sensitivity study revealed that during the full-day sunlight conditions and low wind scenarios that characterized the extreme heatwave, the urban underlayer contributed to a 0.4 degrees C rise in daytime temperature and 1 degrees C increase during nighttime hours in the downtown area. Among the various representative Local Climate Zones (LCZ) types in Paris, namely compact mid-rise, large low-rise, and sparsely built, the contributions to temperature increase were about 0.3 degrees C (0.7 degrees C), 0.3 degrees C (0.5 degrees C), and 0.3 degrees C (0.6 degrees C) for daytime (nighttime) temperatures, respectively. The surface energy budget analysis further indicated that the augmented heat storage within urban impervious surfaces is one of the main causes of the enhanced urban heat island effect, particularly during the nighttime periods during heatwaves.","Ma, Xiaojiao","Miao, Shiguang","Masson, Valery","Wurtz, Jean","Zhang, Yizhou","Wang, Jie","Huang, Xiang-Yu","Yan, Chao",,,,,,,,,,,5,URBAN CLIMATE,Heatwave,Urban thermal environment,Numerical simulation,Hundred-meter-scale,Surface energy budget,BOUNDARY-LAYER,NUMERICAL-SIMULATION,MODEL,MORTALITY,IMPACTS,WAVE,ISLANDS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2024,The synergistic effects of urbanization and an extreme heatwave event on urban thermal environment in Paris
Row_222,"Land use planning has the potential to diminish carbon storages and exacerbate carbon emissions, and therefore improving its contribution to achieve carbon neutrality should be a priority. In this study, we proposed an integrated framework to reveal the interrelation between land use and carbon neutrality. We employed the Linear Programming Model (LPM), Markov, Future Land Use Simulation (FLUS), emission coefficients and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) to predict land use patterns in Hainan Island, China and assessed the potential for reducing carbon emissions and increasing carbon storages under four scenarios: natural development (ND), spatial planning (SP), low-carbon emission (LE), and high-carbon storage (HS) by 2035. The results demonstrate that the new Territory Spatial Planning in 2035 can effectively reduce carbon emissions and increase carbon sinks. Specifically, compared to the ND scenario, carbon emissions will decrease by 5.37 % and carbon storages increase by 0.11 % in the SP scenario. Furthermore, the optimized land use patterns in the low-carbon scenarios will result in a greater reduction in carbon emissions and a larger increase in carbon sinks than the SP scenario. Specifically, compared to the SP scenario, carbon emissions will decrease by 11.83 % in the LE scenario, and carbon storages increase by 4.81 % in the HS scenario. Through the integration of planning and carbon neutrality via land use optimization, this study broadened the theoretical analysis framework and deepened our comprehension of the relationship between land use and carbon neutrality.

Row_224,"Urban waterlogging poses a severe threat to lives and property globally, making it crucial to identify the distribution of urban value and waterlogging risk. Previous research has overlooked the heterogeneity of value and risk in spatial distribution. To identify the overlay effect of urban land value and risk, this study employs the Entropy Weighting Method (EM) to assess urban value, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to determine waterlogging risk and key areas (RK), local Moran's I (SC) to identify key areas (HK), and finally Bivariate local Moran's I (DC) to comprehensively evaluate urban value and waterlogging risk to delineate key areas (BH). The results indicate that waterlogging risk is primarily influenced by proximity to water systems (PCA coefficient: 0.567), population density (0.550), and rainfall (0.445). There is a positive correlation between urban value and waterlogging risk, with a global Moran's I of 0.536, indicating that areas with higher urban value also face greater waterlogging risk. The DC method improved identification precision, reducing the BH area by 6.42 and 3.51 km2 compared to RK and HK, accounting for 25.50 % and 15.76 % of the RK and HK identified areas, respectively. At present, rescue resources can access less than one-third of the area within 5 min, but with the DC method, during the centennial rainfall scenario, the accessibility rate within 5 min for the BH area reaches 63 %, and all BH key areas can be covered within 15 min.

Row_226,"Anthropogenic activities have dramatically altered land use/land cover (LULC), leading to ecosystem service (ES) degradation and further ecological risks. Ecological risks are particularly serious in ecologically fragile regions because trade-offs between economic development and ecological protection are prominent. Thus, ways in which to assess the response of ecological risks to LULC change under each development scenario in ecologically fragile regions remain challenging. In this study, future LUCC and its impact on ESs under four development scenarios in 2040 in western Jilin Province were predicted using a patch-generating land use simulation model and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model. Ecological risk was assessed based on future LUCC possibilities, and potential ES degradation and potential drivers of ecological risks were explored using a geographic detector. The results showed that the cropland development scenario (CDS) would experience large-scale urbanization and cropland expansion. Carbon storage (CS), habitat quality (HQ), and water purifi- cation (WP) degraded the most under the CDS, and grain yield (GY) and water yield (WY) degraded the most under the ecological protection scenario (EPS). The LUCC probability under the CDS (14.37 %) was the highest, while the LUCC probability under the comprehensive development scenario (CPDS) (8.68 %) was the lowest. The risk of WP degradation was greatest under the CDS, but the risk of soil retention (SR) degradation was greatest under the natural development scenario (NDS), EPS, and CPDS. Ecological risk coverage was the largest (98.04 %), and ecological risks were the highest (0.21) under the CDS, while those under the EPS were the opposite. Distance to roads and population density had a higher impact on ecological risks than other drivers.

Here, we have focused on the city of Duzce, NW of Turkey, which has experienced the M > 7 doublet earthquakes in 1999. In order to conduct land cover change analysis and future projection, we have utilized integrated the multilayer perceptron neural network-based Markov chain model combined with geographical information systems. Our results show that most of the land use in 1990 was 77,601 hectares (65.89% of the region) consist of forest and shrubs. By 2020, agricultural land was the most expanding land class in the region with 48.80%. The 1999 earthquake caused the city to grow horizontally in the long run, and this expansion has ended the occupation in grade-one-agricultural lands that prevailed in the region. This horizontal development also caused the residential areas that covered 2.76% of the study area in 1999 expand to the ratio of 20.37% in 2050. It has been determined that the most effective driver in these changes in the land cover is the distance from urban with a Cramer's value of 0.4299. For this reason, the area that is most exposed to land cover change is the forest and shrub areas occupied by the city, which has spread to the northeast due to the earthquake.

Pilot area of Guyuan sponge city, which is divided into 5 source areas, is adopted to conduct 36 types of rainfall scenario simulations with the combination of different rainfall amounts and durations as well as peak coefficients. Inundation analysis methods is used to obtain the relationship between maximum inundation maps and characteristics of rainstorms, and source tracking analysis method is novelty proposed to excavate the response law of the connectivity among source areas to characteristics of rainstorms. First, Results of inundation analysis reveal that rainfall amount, duration and peak value are the first, second and third critical rainstorm characteristics that determine the severity of disasters, the variation of inundation volume are 140 %, 30 % and 4.2 % when precipitation and duration as well as peak value double. Second, the inundation area that water depth more than 0.5 m increases quickly is the major reason that inundation volume varies with 2 times as the increasing of precipitation; the transferring runoff volume between source areas and land use reaches 0-6 % and 0-10 % of inundation volume. Third, SA 1 and 2 are the critical subareas to manage the runoff, when precipitation equals to 200 mm, SA 1 contributes 19.5-33.7 % of inundation volume in SA 2, and SA 2 contributes 28-30 % of inundation volume in SA 3.

However, urban flow exhibits universal heterogeneity, which is mainly manifested in irregular shapes, uneven distribution, and obvious scale differences. The existing methods are constrained by specific spatial scales and sensitive parameter settings, making it difficult to reveal heterogeneous urban mobility patterns within travel OD data. In this paper, we propose an OD flow analysis method that integrates spatial statistics and density clustering. This method can determine parameter values from datasets without manual intervention and adaptively identify multi-scale mixed OD flow clusters. In the simulation experiment, the proposed method accurately detects all preset OD clusters with less noise.

The findings of this study can assist policymakers in developing effective strategies to reduce the risks associated with pluvial floods. Alongside, it also highlights the importance of geospatial techniques to better understand and address the complex challenges of urbanization and climate change. Flood risk zone-specific strategies are recommended to reduce the risk of pluvial floods.","Ali, Muhammad","Mahmood, Shakeel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,Pluvial flood,Assessment,Urban flood,Built-up land,Rainfall,Drainage system,GIS,Lahore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 2024,"Geo-spatial assessment of pluvial floods in city district Lahore, Pakistan"

Row_232,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of the urban environment of the Paris region on an isolated convective cell that formed downwind of the city on May 7, 2022, using the Meso-NH research atmospheric model at a horizontal scale of 300 m. To account for all sources of forecast uncertainty, the initial and lateral boundary conditions of the simulations are provided by an ensemble prediction system. A multi-layer urban scheme is used to represent the influence of buildings on the airflow accurately. Two sets of ensemble simulations are performed: the first set (URB) uses a fine-scale surface description of the city, while the second set (NOURB) replaces urban surfaces with vegetation. This sensitivity test shows that, despite the high variability of simulated precipitation within the ensemble, the city of Paris plays a statistically significant role in the initiation of convection in this case. Convective cells are initiated over the city for several members of the URB ensemble, while almost no precipitation is simulated for the same members of the NOURB ensemble. The mean 6-h rainfall accumulation of the URB ensemble is increased by 70% over Paris (compared with the NOURB ensemble) and no statistically significant trend is found around the city. The analysis reveals that the capital experiences a higher sensible heat flux due to drier and warmer air, resulting in enhanced vertical velocities and an increase in boundary-layer height in the URB ensemble. Additionally, the total water content and cloud fraction over Paris are intensified, leading to more precipitation. These findings suggest that urbanisation has a notable impact on convection and precipitation processes in this case.An ensemble of hectometric numerical simulations with (URB) and without (NOURB) description of the urban environment have been performed for a specific convective case, in the Paris region. An increase in precipitation is observed over the urban environment when the urban scheme is activated. Analysis of the processes reveals a significant effect of the city on near-surface temperature, sensible heat flux, boundary-layer height, and vertical velocities, which helps trigger convection over the city in this case. The difference between URB and NOURB ensemble mean 6-h precipitation accumulation is shown. image","Forster, Arnaud","Augros, Clotilde","Masson, Valery",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY,ensemble simulations,precipitation,urban meteorology,CITY SIZE,LAND-USE,RAINFALL,MODEL,URBANIZATION,MESOSCALE,CLIMATE,IMPACT,PARAMETERIZATION,THUNDERSTORMS,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2024,Urban influence on convective precipitation in the Paris region: Hectometric ensemble simulations in a case study
Row_233,"Partitioning of evapotranspiration (ET) in urban forest lands plays a vital role in mitigating ambient temperature and evaluating the effects of urbanization on the urban hydrological cycle. While ET partitioning has been extensively studied in diverse natural ecosystems, there remains a significant paucity of research on urban ecosystems. The flux variance similarity (FVS) theory is used to partition urban forest ET into soil evaporation (E) and vegetation transpiration (T). This involves measurements from eddy covariance of water vapor and carbon dioxide fluxes, along with an estimated leaf-level water use efficiency (WUE) algorithm. The study compares five WUE algorithms in partitioning the average transpiration fraction (T/ET) and validates the results using two years of oxygen isotope observations. Although all five FVS-based WUE algorithms effectively capture the dynamic changes in hourly scale T and E across the four seasons, the algorithm that assumes a constant ratio of intercellular CO2 concentration (ci) to ambient CO2 concentration (ca) provides the most accurate simulation results for the ratio of T/ET. The performance metrics for this specific algorithm include the RMSE of 0.06, R2 of 0.88, the bias of 0.02, and MAPE of 8.9 %, respectively. Comparing urban forests to natural forests, the T/ET in urban areas is approximately 2.4-25.3 % higher, possibly due to the elevated air temperature (Ta), greater leaf area index (LAI), and increased soil water availability. Correlation analysis reveals that the T/ET dynamic is primarily controlled by Ta, LAI, net radiation, ca, and soil water content at half-hourly, daily, and monthly scales. This research provides valuable insights into the performance and applicability of various WUE algorithms in urban forests, contributing significantly to understanding the impact of urbanization on energy, water, and carbon cycles within ecosystems.","Li, Han","Chen, Han","Huang, Jinhui Jeanne",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,Urban evapotranspiration partitioning,Eddy covariance,Flux variance similarity,Stable water isotope,USE EFFICIENCY,STABLE-ISOTOPES,CO2 FLUXES,CROP COEFFICIENTS,SOIL EVAPORATION,VARIANCE METHOD,WINTER-WHEAT,SURFACE HEAT,TRANSPIRATION,MODEL,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 20 2024,Partitioning urban forest evapotranspiration based on integrating eddy covariance of water vapor and carbon dioxide fluxes
Row_234,"Investigating the spatial distribution and correlation characteristics of carbon emissions would be conducive to the policy formulation for precise carbon emission spatial reduction. Firstly, a new carbon emission spatial inversion model was developed, incorporating nighttime light data and land use data. After verifying the validity and accuracy of the inversion results, the continuous carbon emission spatial data in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Urban Agglomeration (BTHUA) were acquired from 2000 to 2019. Then, the spatial distribution and correlation characteristics were further analyzed in the BTHUA. Finally, policy recommendations were proposed for carbon emission reduction and urban sustainable development. The results showed that the built model can improve the accuracy of the carbon emission spatial inversion data. The carbon emissions were low in the northwest and high in the southeast of the BTHUA, with a noticeable expansion of the high carbon emission contiguous areas around Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, and other prefecture-level cities, which was consistent with the socioeconomic development pattern. The center of gravity of carbon emissions moved to the southeast, showing a relatively stable distribution. The spatial correlation degree of carbon emissions among cities gradually increased, with Beijing and Tianjin playing a prominent role. As a scientific tool, the spatial inversion model helps to produce more accurate spatial data.

Urban development, building heat emissions, and human activities lead to the urban heat island (UHI) effect in which urban air temperatures are significantly higher than those in the surrounding suburban areas.

Geographic Information System tools were used for grid-based spatial data analysis, and a physiological equivalent temperature index map was calculated and overlaid to identify heat zones. The results revealed that environmental factors have complex, nonlinear effects on temperatures in in urban areas; hence, the analysis was challenging.

Row_237,"Urbanization has great potential to adversely affect the local hydrological cycle, as well as result in severe ecological and environmental problems. Piedmont cities have a special topography and complicated overland flow processes, thus creating challenges for the simulation of urban flooding/waterlogging processes. The TVGMUSWM model, a new distributed urban hydrological model that considers the flow routing in urban drainage systems and complicated overland flow processes, was developed in this study. We applied this model to the Huangtaiqiao drainage basin of Jinan City, China and set up two simulation scenarios. The spatial heterogeneity of the proportion of directly connected impervious area (DCIA) and disconnected impervious area (DIA) in sub catchments was considered in scenario B, but not in scenario A. We conducted sensitivity analysis on model parameters by using the Sobol method. Results showed that: (1) model parameters have a certain degree of uncertainty, and the parameter characterizing the proportion of the DCIA and DIA showed a relatively high sensitivity under rainstorms of different levels and different accuracy assessment standards; (2) The simulation of scenario A was poor (with a mean Nash coefficient of 0.59), which ignored the different flow paths followed by runoff from DCIA and DIA; and (3) Considering the spatial differences in the overland flow process, the prediction accuracy of scenario B significantly increased (with a mean Nash coefficient of 0.82). This indicated the importance of the disconnected impervious area and the lateral water exchange across the impervious-pervious interface on the flood simulation in a piedmont city. Compared to most urban hydrological models, the TVGMUSWM model can represent complex rainfall-runoff mechanisms in urban areas with varied terrain.

However, accurate understanding is limited by the lack of high -resolution PM2.5 simulation in cities with sparse monitoring stations and the simultaneously consideration of different landscape types both in 2D and 3D directions. Using Yinchuan City as a case study, an integrated simulation model combining satellite AOD, NDVI and meteorological data was developed using random forest (RF) algorithm to simulate city -scale PM2.5 variation at 30 m resolution. Then, the most critical 2D/3D urban metrics in altering PM2.5 and their impacts were explored through RF analysis. Finally, optimal urban structure was identified using Bayesian Network and multi -scenario analysis. The results indicated that 1) the established RF model could effectively simulate within -city variation of PM2.5 at 30 m with an R2 of 0.75. Thus, it is feasible to use the abundant temporal information and high -resolution AOD to map city -scale PM2.5 and overcome the limitation of spare monitoring stations. 2) The emission -related metric of distance to polluting enterprise and city center had the largest impacts on PM2.5, followed by NDVI, building height, impervious surface area and shape, and UGS green volume, area, shape and connectivity.

So that pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM) cause respiratory diseases, cough headache, etc. Since the amount of pollutants in the air is related to environmental and urban factors, the aim of the current research is to investigate the relationship between the concentration of CO, PM2.5 and PM10 with urban-environmental factors including land use, wind speed and wind direction, topography, traffic, road network, and population through a Land use regression (LUR) model. The concentrations of CO, PM2.5 and PM10 were measured during four seasons from 26th of March 2022 to 16th of March 2023 at 25 monitoring stations and then the information about pollutant measurement points and Land use data were entered into the ArcGIS software.

The results of the health risk assessment showed that the hazard quotient values for all three investigated pollutants were lower than 1 and therefore, they were not in adverse conditions in terms of health effects.

Row_240,"The rainstorms that initiate over mountains, propagate to, and suddenly intensify in nearby plains pose great challenges for weather forecasters and the public. Being in a mountain-plain transition zone, the city of Beijing is prone to rainfall extremes induced by weakly forced mountain-to-plain storms. Despite efforts to understand their possible mechanisms, it remains unclear whether and how these mountain-to-plain precipitation extremes are affected by urbanization in Beijing. Here we use a high-resolution weather prediction model to hindcast a weakly forced mountain-to-plain extreme rainfall event impacting Beijing on 23 June 2011. We incorporate spatially varying urban canopy parameters into the model to assess their effect on rainfall simulation and find no significant improvement in model performance. By comparing simulations under current and pre-urbanization scenarios, we find that urbanization intensifies the regional average rainfall within Beijing's Sixth Ring Road by similar to 23%, with an increase in peak hourly rainfall rate reaching 27 mm hr-1. The higher surface roughness and enhanced vertical motions in urban areas facilitate the transport of warm and humid air from lower to mid-upper layers, fueling the development and maintenance of convective storms. The dragging effect of urban canopy leads to more moisture accumulation and slower-moving convections, resulting in more rainfall falling in urban areas. Our study underscores the key role of local urbanization in shaping the mountain-to-plain rainstorms in Beijing, which may help improve the forecast capacity for these weather extremes and related urban resilience planning.This study aims to investigate whether and how urbanization affects mountain-to-plain rainstorms in Beijing, which pose considerable challenges for weather forecasters and urban residents. A high-resolution weather forecast model is employed to simulate a typical weakly forced mountain-to-plain extreme precipitation event that hit Beijing on 23 June 2011. Incorporating spatially varying urban parameters into the model has a limited effect on the model's ability to reproduce this rainfall case. The findings reveal that urbanization increases rainfall totals in urban areas by nearly 23%, because of the higher urban land surface roughness and drag forces that enhance vertical motions and lower-level water vapor convergence. Moreover, the urban canopy of buildings and roads acts as a barrier, causing more moisture to accumulate and retard the advancement of rainstorms, resulting in more rainfall in urban areas. This understanding could potentially enhance the capability of weather forecasting and disaster planning for these extreme rainfall events, thereby contributing to the strategy development of urban resilience.Gridded urban canopy parameters have a limited effect on model's skill in simulating a typical mountain-to-plain rainfall event in BeijingUrbanization-induced rainfall increase is linked to urban surface dynamics under a weak urban heat islandThe high urban surface roughness and drag force of urban canopy collectively contribute to the precipitation intensification in urban areas","He, Yuting","Wang, Jun","Feng, Jinming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES,mountain-to-plain storm,extreme precipitation,urbanization,urban canopy parameters,land surface roughness,moisture convergence,WARM-SEASON,URBAN,RAINFALL,MODEL,ATLANTA,PARAMETERIZATION,THUNDERSTORMS,SENSITIVITY,SIMULATION,PATTERNS,,,,,,,,,,NOV 27 2023,A Typical Weakly Forced Mountain-To-Plain Extreme Precipitation Event Exacerbated by Urbanization in Beijing

Row_243,"Remote sensing is one of the effective means to obtain urban land surface temperature (LST), but the observed temperature varies with sensor viewing angle due to urban thermal anisotropy (UTA) and biased sensor viewing angle. The anisotropy of satellite -based LST products (e.g., MODIS LST) varies at different time scales. Previous researches focus on the anisotropy of MODIS LST at the seasonal scale or at other time scales (e.g., hourly) but only for individual cities. The characteristics of anisotropy at different time scales and for cities at different latitudes are still unknown. In this study, we focus on analyzing the characteristics of anisotropy at hourly, daily, seasonal, and annual time scales separately for 80 global cities using the simulation data. The simulation data were generated by coupling a microscale urban surface temperature model and a thermal remote sensing model. In addition, the impact factors (i.e., sensor factor, meteorological factor, and surface factor) at different time scales are discussed and validated using satellite observations. The results show that the daytime instantaneous anisotropy varies from -4.2 K to 1.1 K at the hourly scale. For each city, the smaller anisotropy is captured at the local time 12:00 more easily for both Terra and Aqua overpass during daytime. This is because the magnitude of urban thermal anisotropy is more influenced by the sensor factor (i.e., sensor zenith angle), which varies with the overpass time and the relative position of the city in the track. However, if the seasonally or yearly aggregated MODIS LST is utilized to study mean surface temperature, the intensity of angular effect is much smaller with the value ranging from 0.1 K to 3.3 K at the seasonal scale (from 0.2 K to 2.1 K at the yearly scale) because the variation of sensor zenith angle is smoothed. At seasonal and yearly scales, the strength of the angular effect is greater in the morning during daytime, in summer among all seasons, and in the cities with lower latitudes, which is due to larger solar radiation. Among all meteorological factors, wind speed also has a larger impact on the magnitude of surface thermal anisotropy besides the downward surface shortwave radiation. Our study provides a reference for the correction of the angular effect in the MODIS LST products.","He, Xiaoyu","Wang, Dandan","Gao, Si","Li, Xue","Chang, Gaijing","Jia, Xiaodong","Chen, Qiang",,,,,,,,,,,,2,ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING,Urban remote sensing,Thermal anisotropy,Angular effect,MODIS LST,Multi -time scale,THERMAL INFRARED MEASUREMENTS,LOCAL CLIMATE ZONES,SURFACE-TEMPERATURE,DIRECTIONAL ANISOTROPY,ANGULAR VARIATIONS,ENERGY,GEOMETRY,CANOPY,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 2024,The anisotropy of MODIS LST in urban areas: A perspective from different time scales using model simulations

The results showed that carbon sequestration and food security significantly increased in urban and rural landscapes over the past 20 years, with a greater increase observed in rural landscapes due to a substantial reduction in human pressure. The maximum increase in carbon sequestration occurred at a distance of 16.6 km from human settlements. Population decline significantly strengthened the trade-offs between carbon sequestration and food security in landscapes with high and low agricultural pressure. Conversely, in developed urban landscapes, population decline enhanced the synergistic relationship between carbon sequestration and food security.

Therefore, determining the effect of urbanization on the changes in flood hazard zones presents a valuable data for effective flood risk management and urban development planning. In this context, the aim of this study is to reveal the effect of urbanization on flood hazard zones in Kahramanmaras city. In this study, an index-based approach was used to identify the flood hazard zones.

Row_247,"Against the backdrop of rapid global urbanization, the expansion of urban-rural spaces has led to conflicts among production-living-ecological spaces, resulting in a progressive decline in global ecological well-being. Coordinating spatial conflicts to minimize the reduction in ecological well-being is a critical scientific issue urgently needing resolution in current national spatial planning. In fact, the existing studies concentrates on the mechanisms, conceptual implications, evolutionary processes, and optimization simulations of historical spatial conflicts, yielding significant achievements. However, spatial conflicts are irreversible. Compared to studying historical spatial conflicts, assessing spatial conflicts risk which refer to potential occurrence of future spatial conflicts can provide more direct and robust support for optimizing territorial spatial planning. Unfortunately, there is a lack of research on the theory and methods of spatial conflicts risk assessment to date. To fill this gap, take the Production-Living-Ecological (PLE) spaces as a case study, social-ecological system framework (advance in deconstructing complex systems) and the land use function theory (advance in spatial quantification) have been combined to systematically construct a comprehensive framework and method for assessing PLE spatial conflicts risk. This newly framework analyzes the formation mechanism of conflicts risk from the dimensions of spatial pattern and governance. Furthermore, a quantitative and refined assessment method for PLE space conflicts risk at the raster scale is developed based on this framework, coupling coordination degree model, and multivariate data. The feasibility of this framework and method is validated through a case study of Zhangbei County, Hebei Province in China, a typical county in an ecologically fragile mountainous area. Moreover, we establish adaptive selection strategy to PLE space optimization under different governance scenarios based on the assessment result of PLE space conflicts risk. Findings of this research contribute new theoretical and methodological insights into addressing spatial conflicts issues while we are facing a more complex regional and urban system and fragmented governance.

Land use regression (LUR) model is one of the classical methods to simulate the spatial variation of air pollution. Because the nonlinear relationship between PM2.5 concentration and its influencing factors cannot be fully explained by LUR, the optimization of LUR model by random forest algorithm can make up for the defects. In this study, the LUR model was constructed with meteorological factors, three-dimensional urban morphology, land use, terrain elevation and socioeconomic factors as input variables, and the machine learning algorithm random forest (RF) was used to optimize LUR to predict the spatial distribution characteristics of PM2.5 concentration in Fenwei Plain. The results show that the LURRF model has high simulation accuracy and superior performance with correlation coefficient at 0.98, root mean square error at 5.36 and mean absolute error at 3.46. The areas with high PM2.5 concentration are mainly concentrated in Xi'an, Weinan, Linfen, Yuncheng, Jinzhong and Luoyang. The research results can provide important scientific basis for formulating air pollution control strategies.","Wen, F.","Liu, L.","Zhang, P.","Ma, W.","Li, Z.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,"2023 International Conference on Mechatronics, IoT and Industrial Informatics (ICMIII)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023,Prediction of Spatial Distribution of PM2.5 Pollution Based on Machine Learning Random Forest Optimized LUR Model
Row_249,"The urban heat island (UHI) effect is accelerated with urbanization and climate change, thus threatening human survival. The evaporation from water body (E) takes away energy through heat absorption process, thereby effectively play a role in temperature cooling and UHI effect alleviation. However, the response of UHI effect to urban E is still lacks study in the current UHI research. To address this issue, this work proposes a customized water body evaporation model in urban areas. The newly developed urban E model considers the contribution of anthropogenic heat flux (AHF) to the energy balance in urban areas. Meanwhile, AHF is also used to enhance the simulation of the water heat storage change (G) for urban water body. Validation results in two megacities in China indicate that the developed urban E model which considered AHF in the energy balance equation significantly improves the simulation performance of E in the main urban area (the root mean square error (RMSE) significantly decreased by 26.6 W/m2 compared with the original Penman formula for E in the main urban area (Eu) simulation). The consideration of AHF in the G determination improves the simulation performance of E in the deep water body (the RMSE significantly decreased by 33.3 W/m2 compared to the AHFPenman model that do not considering G for E simulation in deep water body). The developed urban E model is further used to evaluate the response of UHI to the Eu and E in the suburban area (Es). It is found that Eu effectively alleviates UHI, while Es aggravate UHI. Moreover, the cooling effect of E in the main urban areas (& UDelta;Tau) and suburbs (& UDelta;Tas) are increased with urbanization. The increasing rate of & UDelta;Tau is higher than & UDelta;Tas, indicate the contribution of evaporation cooling to the UHI alleviation is increased with urbanization. Further analysis demonstrate the urbanization process can explain approximately 90% of the enhanced ability of E to mitigate the UHI effect. Correlation analysis shows that the mitigation capability of E to UHI effect is mainly controlled by the volume and surface size of water body. Finally, future climate scenario-based urban E forecast confirms that & UDelta;Tau and & UDelta;Tas will continue to rise with climate change. The average increasing rate are 0.018 degrees C/ year and 0.013 degrees C/year for & UDelta;Tau and & UDelta;Tas, respectively, under the three representative concentration pathways. The increasing rate of & UDelta;Tau is larger than & UDelta;Tas, suggesting the mitigation of the UHI effect will benefit more from urban E under the future climate change. Generally, our findings highlight that the mitigation of the UHI effect mainly benefits from E in the main urban area rather than E in the suburban area. This study gains insight into E in urban areas, including its algorithm, interaction with the UHI effect, and responses to urbanization and climate change. The results of this study provide a good scientific basis for urban landscape water planning.","Chen, Han","Huang, Jinhui Jeanne","Li, Han","Wei, Yizhao","Zhu, Xiaotong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,12,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Urban heat island (UHI) effect,Urban water body evaporation,Anthropogenic heat flux (AHF),Water storage heat change (G),Urbanization,Climate change,TIME-SERIES DATA,SURFACE-TEMPERATURE,LAKE EVAPORATION,IMPACT,MODEL,EVAPOTRANSPIRATION,MICROCLIMATE,HYDROLOGY,PATTERNS,CLIMATE,,,,,,,,,,AUG 2023,Revealing the response of urban heat island effect to water body evaporation from main urban and suburb areas
Row_250,"Urban spatial interaction serves as an indicative measure for estimating the intensity and character of interurban linkages and relationships. The previous studies have utilized intercity relational data (e.g., population migration (PM), goods trade, and information exchange) to build up urban connections directly. Besides, the nighttime light (NTL) data have also been adopted to simulate a dynamic urban intercity flow. However, the relevant studies have not clearly defined the urban spatial interaction based on the NTL data. To answer this question, we used trial-and-error testing to define the NTL-based interaction. First, five traditional urban interactions were selected as the potential definitions, including PM, transfer of innovation, information flow (IF), financial flow, and urban composite interaction (CI). Second, as usual, the NTL-based urban interaction, named the NTL interaction (NTLI) index, was simulated based on the NPP-VIIRS-like NTL data and the radiation model. Taking the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomerations (YRDUAs) as an example, we found that the NTL-based urban interaction is more like the PM at the urban agglomeration scale and the provincial scale with R-2 of 0.71 and 0.59, respectively. In addition to this, the NTLI index has a weak correlation with the transfer of patent (TP) index, IF index, economic interaction (EI) index, and CI index. To sum up, the interaction network from NTL data can be an adequate proxy of urban population interaction, rather than the knowledge network or economic network.

Row_251,"Spatiotemporal risk and future evolutionary distribution characteristics of industrial sites are crucial for regional environmental supervision. However, traditional site survey methods have long cycles, high costs, and small coverage and usually only consider the static risk of a single industrial site to a single receptor. Low-cost, large-scale, and long-term multi-source data can compensate for the shortcomings of traditional site surveys. Previous studies have rarely considered the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of industrial sites and assessed their dynamic risks at the regional scale. This study used China's Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration as the study area. We assessed the risk potential of industrial sites from 2000 to 2020 using multi-source and multiperiod data. We also simulated the risk potential for 2030 and 2050 using a patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model under different scenarios. The results indicated that the proportion of medium- and high-risk potential grids from 2000 to 2020 ranged from 2.53 % to 5.61 % in the study area, with the vast majority of areas (94.39 %-97.47 %) having low- or no-risk potential. The PLUS model exhibited remarkable reliability from 2005 to 2020, with the overall accuracy, Kappa coefficient, and Moran's index ranging from 83 % to 89 %, 0.38 to 0.59, and 0.34 to 0.56, respectively. The future prediction results indicated that the number of high-risk potential grids (>5 %) showed an upward trend under natural development scenarios in 2030 and 2050 and a downward trend under the ten-chapter soil pollution action plan or strict control scenarios.

Row_252,"The current research on urban heat island (UHI) effect mostly focuses on the analysis of land use type changes and the surface UHI intensity. Few studies on the urban canopy heat island effect at a block scale of local climate zone (LCZ), although the canopy heat island effect is a key factor affecting human thermal comfort. Therefore, this study will combine the LCZ classification system and the urban weather generator (UWG) model to simulate and quantitatively analyse the urban canopy heat island effect in Beijing at the block scale. First, based on Sentinel-2 Multispectral remote sensing images, the residual neural network (ResNet) method was used to obtain the LCZ of Beijing, and the results of LCZs was validated based on the google earth engine (GEE). Then, according to the classification results of local climate zones, the input parameters of the UWG and their corresponding value ranges are calculated. Finally, the UWG model is used to simulate the canopy temperature in different local climate zones, and the urban canopy temperature is validated using the meteorological station dataset. We quantitatively analyse the temperature differences between different types of LCZs. The results shows that the canopy heat island effect in Beijing gradually weakened outward from the city centre. This is mainly due to the relatively dense distribution of compact local climate zones in the centre of Beijing, while the surrounding areas of Beijing have lower building density and better natural coverage. The canopy urban heat island intensity of built-up LCZs is significantly stronger than that of natural-covered LCZs. The heat island intensity of the compact LCZ is higher than that of the open LCZ with the same building height. However, for LCZs with comparable compactness, the heat island intensity of high-level LCZs is higher than that of low-level LCZs.","Zhang, Wenzhi","Huo, Hongyuan","Geng, Xiaowei","Zhou, Ping","Guo, Li","Li, Zhao-Liang",,,,,,,,,,,,,8,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING,Local climate zone,canopy urban heat island,urban weather generator,Sentinel-2,SENTINEL-2 IMAGES,CLASSIFICATION,INTENSITY,SCHEME,CITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 17 2024,Simulation of canopy urban heat island at a block scale based on local climate zones and urban weather generator: a case study of Beijing
Row_253,"It is necessary to comprehend the impacts of climate change and human activities on hydrological processes to effectively manage water resources. This study focuses on the Huangfuchuan Basin and investigates changes in hydrology and land use within the basin. The Budyko method and the water and energy processes (WEP) hydrological model were employed to assess the effects of climate change and underlying surface changes on runoff. The results showed that: (1) Runoff in the Huangfuchuan Basin exhibited a pronounced decreasing trend between 1960 and 2015, with an annual average runoff of 42.82 m(3)/s. (2) According to the Budyko method, the underlying surface change had the highest contribution rate to runoff at 83.54 %, followed by rainfall at 12.28 %. (3) Based on the simulation of the WEP hydrological model, climate change contributed to 22.08 % of the runoff change. Land use change accounted for 65.95 % of the runoff change. (4) Various future climate change scenarios were examined in this study. The maximum average runoff simulated by the model occurred when rainfall increased by 20 % and temperature decreased by 20 %, resulting in a 13.485 m(3)/s increase compared to the base scenario.

However, the responses of both channel runoff and surface runoff to the urbanization and the underlying mechanisms still deserve more in-depth exploration within urban extents with limited data availability. Accordingly, we conducted a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the urbanization effects on channel and surface runoff from both statistical and model-based perspectives over three major urban agglomerations (i.e., Chengyu (CY), middle region of Yangtze River (MRYR), Yangtze River Delta (YRD)) in the Yangtze River Basin. The long-term highresolution channel and surface runoff under different urbanization scenarios were simulated using both WRFHydro and SCS-CN models by integrating multiple remotely sensed, reanalysis, and in-situ datasets. Results demonstrated that the channel runoff increased by 4.4%, 5%, and 12.08% in CY, MRYR, and YRD urban agglomerations, respectively. Meanwhile, the urbanization also contributed to 30%, 21.4%, and 17.7% of the surface runoff changes in three urban agglomerations. Based on the high-resolution local climate zone (LCZ), our results highlighted that the high-rise and middle-rise buildings and compact-arranged regions were more prone to accumulating surface runoff and trigger flooding events due to the weaker infiltration capacity of land surface with the densely distribution of impervious surface. Further machine learning based investigation and case analysis also explored the potential influencing factors and mechanisms of the impact of urbanization on channel and surface runoff.

The green view index (GVI) can improve the limitations of the existing road greenery index, which is too planarized.This study used road patterns and vegetation structures to explore the intrinsic connection and application possibilities between the GVI and the urban road greenery indicators. The study acquired and then selected 27,038 valid street images to calculate the GVI through semantic segmentation, and used ArcGIS10.6 to calculate the greenery land ratio (GLR) and greenery coverage ratio (GCR) for 593 roads. After strictly controlling of the variables, typical roads were selected for simulation scenario comparison experiments.The results indicates that the GVI will be lower than the greenery volume of two-dimensional indicators, and a threshold within 30% can be set as a preliminary reference of the GVI standard for urban streetscapes. The GVI is irreplaceable and has a more flexible range, which provides a more comprehensive, accurate and rigorous evaluation of the greenery volume. The central greenery belt and the shrub layer are essential to enhance GVI. From all researched viewpoints, the Tree-Shrub and Tree-Shrub-Herb structures have similar GVI values.

Row_256,"Knowledge of land use and land cover (LULC) dynamics helps policymakers set sustainable land management plans. Population growth, migration, and rural exodus have led to spatial expansion in many cities worldwide, especially in coastal urban settings. This research aims at assessing and predicting LULC over the Agoenyive plateau (AP) in Togo, using remote sensing and Markov Chain along with local perceptions on LULC change, thus considering four scenarios (i.e., Business-as Usual, afforestation, wetland policy, and building policy). LULC was classified based on the maximum likelihood algorithm using Landsat images. The future scenarios maps were produced using the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks-Markov chain modelling approach by considering five driver variables considered to affect future development. The historical change analysis was performed for the periods of 1986-2001, 2001-2011, and 2011-2020, while 1986-2020 was used for model validation and change prediction. Image accuracy assessment was performed using the error or confusion matrices, kappa coefficients (Kscores), Relative Operating Characteristics (ROC), and accuracy scores, with an overall accuracy (Kappa coefficient) of 87% (0.81), 88% (0.81), 90% (0.82), and 92% (0.84) for the years 1986, 2001, 2011, and 2020, respectively. The results showed an increase in built-up areas (38.71% land gain), while a decrease was observed in mixed vegetation/savannah (22.69% land loss), croplands/bare surfaces (22.89%), and wetlands (3.36% land loss) over the period of 1986-2020. An increase in built-up areas (7.79% and 19.79% land gain by 2030 and 2050, respectively) and a decrease in mixed vegetation (1.13% and 2.54% land loss by 2030 and 2050, respectively), croplands and bare surfaces (6.58% and 16.98% loss by 2030 and 2050, respectively), and wetlands (0.13% and 0.31% loss by 2030 and 2050, respectively), are expected under the BAU scenario. Contrary to the wetland policy, which induces change only in the wetlands (0.02% and 0.047% land loss by 2030 and 2050, respectively), the afforestation scenario results in a gain in forest/savannah (0.11% and 0.73% land gain by 2030 and 2050 compared to the BAU scenario), but also a decrease in croplands/bare surfaces (0.64% by 2050 compared to the BAU scenario), whereas the building policy scenario results in a long-term increase in croplands/bare surfaces (2.88% by 2050, compared to the BAU), and wetlands (0.027 and 2.88% by 2050) in addition to the mixed vegetation/savannah. LULC dynamics (including future urbanization trends) for the AP under various scenarios is a step ahead of time, highlighting the importance of the implementation of existing laws and policies, but also providing information to deal with the observed inharmonious spatial development of urban centres, and serving as a dataset source for LULC change impact assessments on related resources.

Previous studies mainly focus on the effects of local LULCC on runoff generation processes; however, few on the effects of the climate feedbacks of LULCC. Here we couple the Variable Infiltration Capacity model with climate forcing from the Land Use Model Intercomparison Project, part of the new state-of-the-art Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6, to synthetically detect global LULCCinduced impacts on hydrological extremes in one of the fastest developing areas in China and the world, i.e., the Yangtze River Delta (YRD). Results suggest that global LULCC increased extreme rainfall by 1.41 similar to 3.90 % with spatial heterogeneity over YRD, especially during the rapid urbanization period. Regions with increasing extreme rainfall during the rapid urbanization stage match well with the city belt distribution, indicating the precipitation enhancement effects of the urban land surface. The combined impacts (with both LULCC and its climate feedbacks) lead to a 3.01-7.18 % increase in extreme runoff, much higher than the effects of LULCC only (0.05-0.14 %). The consistent signs of changes in extreme rainfall and runoff indicate the dominant role of LULCC-induced climate feedback in the changes in extreme runoff over the YRD region. In addition, flash droughts increased when considering the climate feedbacks of global LULCC, particularly during the rapid urbanization stage. LULCC tends to increase average flows, high flows, and low flows, particularly in an urbandominated basin. When considering the climate feedback effects from global LULCC, the LULCC would lead to a larger increase in high flows and average flows, thus floods.

Furthermore, we used ENVI-met, a microclimate simulation model, to simulate the Tair in designed scenarios and evaluate the impact of SVF on the Tair of each component. A number of significant observations were noted based on the experimental results: (1) from 10:00 to 17:00, there is a positive correlation between SVF and Tair; from 18:00 to 9:00 the next day, there is a negative correlation between SVF and Tair (2) the relationship between building shadow ratio (BSR) and Tair is not a single negative correlation: at sunrise, BSR is the maximum in a day, but the cooling effect of BSR on Tair is not obvious because of the weak solar radiation. In addition, the arrangement of building directions has a great influence on the rela-tionship between BSR and Tair (3) for the same building scenario, BSR decreases with the increase of SVF (4) the synergistic effect of SVF and BSR on Tair in the daytime can be divided into two periods, the separation time points are 7:00 and 14:00.

The goal is to enable real-time wind-based trajectory planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in an urban environment. Three data reconstruction methods were considered, including the Gappy Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) as a modal approximation technique and two data-driven approaches: the shallow neural network (SNN) and the random forest (RF) model. The data reconstruction was performed using a small number of wind sensor measurements within the urban environment. As no experimental wind data were available, simulated wind sensor data were used from a test case scenario. The urban environment studied covered a district of Berlin (Germany) measuring 1 km2. Prior to the data reconstruction, three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulations were conducted to simulate various wind fields in the area. The wind direction was selected as a parameter, and the inlet wind velocity was set at a constant rate of 5 m/s. The simulated wind fields were used to train the reconstruction models. Different sized training libraries were considered that included various numbers of training examples. The reconstruction accuracy and performance parameters, such as time and memory costs, were assessed. The study concluded that when the number of sensors is limited, the SNN (= 0.169) and the RF model (= 0.168) perform slightly better than the Gappy POD (= 0.184) in terms of wind field reconstruction accuracy. However, the Gappy POD and SNN show faster wind field reconstruction (less than 4 seconds) and require less memory capacity compared to the RF model, making them more suitable for real-time wind-based UAV trajectory planning.","Ebert, C.","Weiss, J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,AIAA AVIATION 2023 Forum,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023,A Comparison between Neural Networks and Gappy POD for Urban Wind Field Estimation

Daily ET was close to zero during winter and reached 3-6 mm day-1 in summer. Daily ET increased with vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and soil water content (SWC). When binning daily data into 10 bins according to percentiles of either SWC or VPD, surface conductance (gs) increased with SWC for all VPD bins, but showed weak responses to VPD for SWC bins. Monthly ET increased linearly with normalized difference vegetation index, showed a strong correlation with gs, and exhibited saturated responses to increasing monthly precipitation (PPT). Annual ET ranged from 326 to 566 mm (with the eleven-year mean of 428.66 +/- 83.83 mm; mean +/- SD), and varied from 55 % to 148 % of annual PPT. Aggregated ET over the eleven years (4715 mm) accounted for 82 % of the aggregated PPT. Soil water replenishment through PPT from mid-summer to late autumn of the previous year was responsible for the generally higher monthly ET in spring relative to PPT, resulting in a weak correlation between annual ET and PPT in the same calendar year (R2= 0.28). The PPT in the early growing season partly promoted annual ET through its effect on summer gs. Our results suggest that biotic factors and PPT seasonality played an essential role in regulating ET at the seasonal and interannual scales, respectively. Soil dryness imposed additional constraints on gs at the finer timescale (i.e., days). Urban land surface models should adequately address the soil moisture carryover effect to improve simulations.","Li, Xinhao","Zha, Tianshan","Black, Andrew","Jia, Xin","Jassal, Rachhpal S.","Liu, Peng","Tian, Yun","Jin, Chuan","Yang, Ruizhi","Zhang, Feng","Yu, Haiqun","Xie, Jing",,,,,,,3,AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY,Evapotranspiration,Precipitation,Soil water content,Urban forests,ENERGY-BALANCE CLOSURE,NET ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE,CONTRASTING PRECIPITATION,INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY,SEMIARID SHRUBLAND,USE EFFICIENCY,CARBON,FLUX,PLANTATION,MOISTURE,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 15 2024,"Stronger control of surface conductance by soil water content than vapor pressure deficit regulates evapotranspiration in an urban forest in Beijing, 2012-2022"
Row_264,"This study sought to demonstrate that small renewal projects could contribute to improved ventilation for the mitigation of urban heat island effects by designing building forms through urban design guidelines. Such a task is particularly important in an older built environment in many early developed cities, where large-scale urban renewal has been difficult to implement. Consequently, wind corridors are unlikely to be created to transfer heat away from cities, as suggested by previous studies. This study used computer simulations to assess the extent to which changes in building forms could drive wind flow through small-scale renewal sites. The removal of small, fragmented buildings during the renewal process was found to be of great significance for improving local ventilation, which can be regulated through urban design strategies with a low building coverage ratio. Moreover, adjusting the floor area ratio could help create open spaces that benefit on-site and off-site wind environments. This study highlighted small-scale urban renewal projects and their contribution to improving ventilation and mitigating urban heat island effects. These projects can be applied in urban renewal and regeneration through urban design guidelines for the regulation of the spatial distribution of buildings. Of note, wind factors must be integrated into site planning and architectural design processes. In conclusion, the incorporation of wind factors into planning and design processes will help combat urban heat island effects in cities.","Hsieh, Chun-Ming","Yu, Cheng-Yu","Shao, Lu-Yun",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT,Urban design,Urban heat island,Ventilation corridor,Urban renewal,Least cost path (LCP),Computational fluid dynamics (CFD),COMPUTATIONAL FLUID-DYNAMICS,THERMAL COMFORT,LAND-USE,GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE,VENTILATION,IMPACT,CITY,PARK,URBANIZATION,MICROCLIMATE,,,,,,,,,,JUN 1 2023,Improving the Local Wind Environment through Urban Design Strategies in an Urban Renewal Process to Mitigate Urban Heat Island Effects

Based on the land use data from 1985 to 2020, and the InVEST modeling and relevant spatial data sources, the paper analyzed the spatial and temporal changes in land use cover and habitat quality in the coastal China over the past 30 years. The results show that: 1) land use cover in the coastal China has changed significantly during the study period, with the area of cultivated land continuing to decrease and construction land expanding; 2) the trend of habitat quality degradation in was obvious, with the area of low-value habitat quality continuing to increase. Spatially, they were mainly located in the three major urban agglomerations undergoing rapid industrialization and urbanization; 3) The average degradation of habitats increased significantly between 1990 and 2000 and 2010-2020. The rate of change in areas with different degradation levels from 1990 to 2000 was higher than in other periods. The low-value areas of habitat degradation are mainly located in hilly and mountainous regions. 4) The transfer of habitat grades was generally characterized by a shift from high grade to low grade. This trend of conversion was due to the largescale occupation of cultivated land by construction land and the long-term encroachment of ecological land by cultivated land. For future development, it is recommended to improve the land use regulation system based on the principles of sustainable development, with a particular focus on habitat protection. Additionally, efforts should be made to strengthen the development of ecological agriculture, carry out ecological protection and restoration, and improve the mechanisms for coordinating land and sea management.","Qin, Xianhong","Yang, Qingke","Wang, Lei",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,Land-use change,Habitat quality,Spatial response,InVEST model,Coastal China,BIODIVERSITY,ECOSYSTEM,PATTERNS,AREA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 20 2024,"The evolution of habitat quality and its response to land use change in the coastal China, 1985-2020"

The evident paradox of the sluggish diffusion of cost-effective green housing has garnered growing attention. This study introduces a Use-Purchase-Supply (U-P-S) model to unveil the ""black box"" of this paradox and develops a simulation model to quantify the diffusion dynamics of green housing based on the classic ""epidemic model"". Using China as a case for simulation, the model identifies key drivers, with a specific focus on the impact of density bonuses. The results reveal that lower-rated green housing can proliferate independently, whereas higher-rated green housing development hinges on policy instruments for market traction. Density bonuses demonstrate to be as potent as the reduction of green incremental costs, which is the paramount driver of green housing diffusion. Furthermore, this study extends its insights globally by contrasting core parameters across countries.

Precise prediction of LUCC and accurate quantification of the impact of such changes on ESs are essential for effective ecological conservation and management. We assessed the Poyang Lake Basin ESs for 2000, 2010, and 2020. Additionally, we projected land-use maps for 2030 under unrestricted development (UD), ecological protection (EP), and urbanization expansion (UE) scenarios using a logistic CA-Markov improved model. Based on this, future ecosystem changes under different scenarios were revealed, and the response of ESs to different LUCCs were quantified. The findings indicated that the most significant change in the watershed over the past two decades was a 92.50% expansion of built-up land. Although ESs exhibited stability in space and time, local heterogeneity emerged under different scenarios. EP positively influenced carbon storage, habitat quality, and soil retention, while UD and UE negatively affected watershed ES index values. Farmland and woodland significantly influenced ES, contributing more than 86.06%. Conversions from farmland, woodland, and grassland to other land types negatively affected ES, while transformations from built-up and unutilized land to woodland and grassland had positive effects. The critical contributing indices in the watershed were primarily concentrated between farmland and woodland.

The means of accurately assessing and improving the level of urban resilience (UR) to cope with disturbances and shocks, enhance regional resilience, and improve sustainable urban development has become a hot topic. In this study, we constructed an UR assessment framework using ""social-economic-institutional-ecological-engineering"" to explore the dynamic evolution of spatial and temporal patterns in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) of China, to reveal the main factors influencing the evolution of this spatial pattern and the strength and interaction mechanisms among such influencing factors and to dynamically simulate the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics in the next 16 years. The results show that from 2000 to 2019, the difference in UR level in the GBA is obvious. Hong Kong and Macao are obviously ahead of other cities, and the comprehensive resilience level of Guangzhou and Shenzhen cities in the mainland is developing rapidly. The difference in per capita consumption capacity, industrial structure optimization, foreign trade vitality, infrastructure support and other factors are the main causes of the spatial differentiation of UR in the GBA. In the future, the UR level of the GBA urban agglomeration will show an overall upwards trend.

The results of the study show that there is a stable secondary relationship between carbon emissions and urban population scale, which means that the growth rate of urban carbon emissions is significantly lagging behind the growth of urban systems. The analysis of urban carbon emission efficiency based on SAMI values shows significant spatial heterogeneity: the carbon emission efficiency of cities in North China, East China, and Northeast China is lower than that of other regions. In terms of temporal changes, there was a phenomenon of SAMI high-value cities moving north and low-value cities moving south between 2006 and 2017, and Delta SAMIs showed a pattern of hot in the west and cold in the east.

Previous research was mainly focused on outward urban expansion, while the impact of urban densification on urban thermal environments has been infrequently investigated. This study first analyzed the 3D urban landscape patterns across central Wuhan in 2008 and 2018, and explored urban densification modes using multivariate clustering analysis based on the differences in the landscape metrics between 2008 and 2018. Second, the landscape metrics and other urban canopy parameters were incorporated into a mesoscale model coupled with an urban canopy model to quantify the impact of urban densification on urban mesoscale thermal environments in central Wuhan. Results showed that urban densification mainly took place between the 2nd- and 3rd-ring roads. The high-rise, middensity urban densification, the most intensive urban densification mode in central Wuhan, led to warming of 1.3 degrees C, drying of 0.5 g/kg, a decrease in wind speed by 1.7 m/s, and an increase in heat stress by 1.7 degrees C to a maximum extent through the day. The mid-rise, mid-density urban densification had weaker impacts on air temperature, relative humidity, and human thermal comfort, but a stronger impact on wind speed than the lowrise, high-density urban densification.

However, in the current research on simulating optimization processes, the ecological constraints often set are dispersed, isolated, and fixed.

This study, taking the main urban area of Hangzhou, China as a case study and employing small mammals as indicator species, utilizes the PLUS model to predict the potential threats to landscape connectivity of biological habitats posed by artificial surface expansion from 2020 to 2035. It constructs a coupled mechanism that integrates multi-level ecological security patterns (ESPs) and multi-scenario simulation for landscape connectivity, successfully demonstrating the effectiveness of this mechanism in future landscape connectivity preservation. The results indicate that under the scenarios of business-as-usual (BAU), priority given to urban development (PUD), and priority given to ecological protection (PEP), the overall level of landscape connectivity in the main urban area of Hangzhou is projected to decrease by 18.42%, 7.02%, and 4.39% respectively from 2020 to 2035.

With the development of high-resolution remote sensing satellite technology, there is a growing focus on achieving precise LULC classification. However, the accuracy of fine-grained LULC classification is challenged by the high intra-class diversity and low inter-class separability inherent in high-resolution remote sensing images. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel multi-path feature fusion semantic segmentation model, called MPFFNet, which combines the segmentation results of convolutional neural networks with traditional filtering processes to achieve finer LULC classification. MPFFNet consists of three modules: the Improved Encoder Module (IEM) extracts contextual and spatial detail information through the backbone network, DASPP, and MFEAM; the Improved Decoder Module (IDM) utilizes the Cascade Feature Fusion (CFF) module to effectively merge shallow and deep information; and the Feature Fusion Module (FAM) enables dual-path feature fusion using a convolutional neural network and Gabor Filter. Experimental results on the large-scale classification set and the fine land-cover classification set of the Gaofen Image Dataset (GID) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving mIoU scores of 81.02% and 77.83%, respectively.

Up to now, no comprehensive study has been presented on land subsidence in the Tehran metropolis. This study addresses this shortcoming through a comprehensive investigation of surface and sub-surface factors that affect the subsidence and investigates the mechanism of subsidence development in Tehran. Land surface studies involve assessing the subsidence rate by utilizing InSAR technology, tracking the urban development of the city through time, and investigating geomorphological features like the alluvial fans landforms and surface drainage. Sub-surface studies include groundwater and geotechnical assessments. The evaluations indicate that the combinations of soils with a high percentage of fine grains and the drop in the underground water level are the major drivers of subsidence in the south of Tehran. The results of the study showed that the highest rate of land subsidence is 217 mm/year and has happened in the southwest of Tehran city. Districts 10, 11, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20, which comprise about 26% of Tehran's population (about 2.3 million people in 2016), are affected by subsidence. According to the results obtained from the geomorphological studies, these areas are located at the end of the alluvial fan of Kan and Chitgar (south and southwest of Tehran). The paper also focuses on the sharp northward growth of the subsidence zone in the northeast corner of Tehran's subsidence zone. From investigations, it is concluded that changes in four river courses (which lead to a drop in the underground water level) in conjunction with fine grain soil of this area are (probably) the major factors that have played a role in the northward growth of the subsidence zone at the northeastern corner.

To formulate locally adapted mitigation strategies, a comprehensive understanding of the influencing mechanisms of UHI at high resolution is imperative. Based on surface energy balance, we attributed surface UHI (SUHI) into five biophysical terms (surface radiation, anthropogenic heat, convection, evapotranspiration and heat storage term) using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images in Beijing. The simulated SUHI intensity, derived by combining all five contribution terms, exhibited a good consistency but a higher spatial resolution, than SUHI intensity extracted from Landsat-8 land surface temperature product. SUHI intensity tended to decrease from the old city to outsides, attributed to the decrease of evapotranspiration, solar radiation and anthropogenic heat term. The convection and heat storage term play a positive role in reducing SUHI. Among urban morphological blocks, low-rise and high-density blocks had the strongest SUHI, with the evapotranspiration term contributing the most.

This ambitious project is demonstrating that urban ecosystem restoration can be successfully implemented at a large city-level scale. The hydro corridor's transition from turf grass to deep-rooted native meadow plants is hypothesized to enhance the regulating (e.g., erosion and flood control) and supporting (e.g., soil quality regulation and nutrient cycling) services. This study aims to evaluate this hypothesis. In-situ infiltration, penetrometer tests, and soil sampling were conducted on two pre-restored turf lands and two restored meadows in 2020. Soil samples were analyzed for bulk density, porosity, total carbon, total nitrogen, and available phosphorus. Water balance analysis was conducted by simulating artificial rainfall events with different return periods upon undisturbed vegetated soil samples with accompanying saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements using a mini-disk infiltrometer. The restored meadows had a similar in-situ saturated hydraulic conductivity with turf lands, but had a lower cone index, and a higher bulk density and lower porosity than the turf lands. The soil nutrient content showed large variation among different sites. However, a notable trend in soil available phosphorus was measured where it was consistently higher in surrounding pre-restored turf lands than in restored meadows. The rainfall simulation tests showed that the turf lands generated much more surface runoff than the restored meadows during rainfall events with return periods from 2 to 100 years, while the saturated hydraulic conductivities of soil samples from the restored meadows and the turf lands were not considerably different. This indicated that the saturated hydraulic conductivity measurement is not a good indicator to quantify the hydrological regulating functions of green infrastructure like The Meadoway.","Qin, K.","Isaac, M.","Drake, J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,Proceedings of the Canadian Society of Civil Engineering Annual Conference 2022.

The model is trained and validated using data from 2000 to 2010, and its effectiveness is tested using data from 2010 to 2020.

Additionally, we adopt a data splitting strategy that takes into account the different transitions between classes, improving the accuracy of the model predictions of minority class. The obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model in capturing complex spatio-temporal dynamics and reducing the impact of imbalanced datasets surpassing existing methods.

Developed urbanized areas are featured in fewer spaces for greening. In this study, we set three scenarios for coordinating the provision and demand of urban green spaces at a block scale. Taking the main city of Wuhan as an example, we apply the location-allocation model in order to identify potential sites for new green spaces. Then, the simulations of the three scenarios are used to depict various development strategies by evaluating the improvement of green equity. Our results show that the levels of green space accessibility are lower on the west side of the city center, while relatively higher on the east side, due to abundant natural resources. The Gini coefficient is 0.715, indicating unequal access for citizens to green space. Increasing green areas could enhance green equity, and the most effective way to allocate new increments is based on the accessibility. For developed cities, blocks with lower accessibility should be given priority when increasing green areas; doing so could offset the shortage of large green areas and reduce green inequity within daily walking distances. Optimal green space planning of small and functional parks near communities has the potential to meet higher recreational demands in densely populated areas.","Chen, Yuanyuan","Men, Hongling","Ke, Xinli",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21,URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING,Green space accessibility,Location-allocation,Lorenz curve,Spatial equity,Simulation,PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY,ACCESSIBILITY,HEALTH,PARKS,CITY,GIS,URBANIZATION,INEQUALITIES,ENVIRONMENT,PROVISION,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2023,Optimizing urban green space patterns to improve spatial equity using location-allocation model: A case study in Wuhan
Row_282,"Urban green space is widely acknowledged to promote public health through multiple pathways. However, there is limited understanding of how the spatial patterns of green space might play different roles in such a process. This study examined potential pathways through which spatial patterns of green space improved people's life satisfaction (LS) by reducing air pollution. A partial least squares structural equation model was adopted to explore these pathways in sampled urban areas (township) of China (n = 60). Green space spatial patterns were measured using landscape metrics of size, aggregation, fragmentation, and diversity. The results did not show that green space spatial pattern promoted LS by reducing air pollution. However, green space size and fragmentation were negatively associated with air pollution (mainly PM 2.5, PM 10, and NO 2). The pattern of highly densely distributed small green spaces was related to higher LS, as was high diversity of green space type. Simply adopting a fragmented green space pattern to reduce air pollution might be simultaneously associated with reduced LS. This alerts decision-makers and planners to the potential ""double-edged sword"" effect of optimizing green space structures to improve air quality, which may not yield strongly favorable results due to the impacts that hinder LS.","Wu, Longfeng","Chen, Chongxian",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,19,URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING,Urban green space,Landscape metrics,Air pollution,Life Satisfaction,Mediation effects,Partial least squares structural equation,modeling (PLS-SEM),ENVIRONMENTAL-QUALITY,PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY,LAND-USE,HEALTH,MORTALITY,VALUATION,HAPPINESS,EXPOSURE,BENEFITS,ASSOCIATIONS,,,,,,,,,APR 2023,Does pattern matter?

Row_283,"The present study examines the effectiveness of six LID-BMPs in urban runoff reduction in Neyshabour city, Iran. The validated Storm Water Management Model (SWMM5.1) was employed to assess the effectiveness of LID-BMPs in mitigating runoff volume. The hydrological model was calibrated and validated with nine in-site measured flood hydrographs. 11 LID-BMP scenarios were planned to determine the most effective combination of LID-BMPs. The results showed that according to the site conditions, Infiltration Trench (IT) and Rain Barrel (RB) practices with 22.2% and 0.4% reduction rates had the highest and lowest efficiency in reducing urban runoff. By assessing various combinations of LID-BMPs, it was found that the combination of IT, Bio-Retention (BR), Stormwater Dry Ponds (SDP), Porous Pavement (PP), and Rain Garden (RG) provides the most effective strategy for runoff management.

However, there have not been holistic assessments of the importance of tree canopy on vacant land as a component of greenspace networks within cities, and the potential impact of developing vacant land on connectivity within these networks at the city scale. In this study, we use Hartford, CT, USA as a case study to evaluate the contribution of existing tree canopy on vacant lots to landscape connectivity and to assess how future vacant land development scenarios alter landscape connectivity at the city scale. This study leveraged morphological spatial pattern analysis and network analysis and found that vacant lots supported approximately 8% of core canopy area, 13% of corridors, and 12% of landscape connectivity value in the entire city landscape. In addition, we found that the factors including lot size, average distance to all cores, perimeter-area ratio, zoning, and percentage of tree canopy were the best predictors of the landscape connectivity values of individual vacant parcels through Random Forest. Furthermore, potential vacant land management scenarios with varying degrees of development, preservation, and greening were compared. An ""Extreme Greening"" scenario increased existing landscape connectivity by 16%, and an ""Optimized Conservation and Development"" scenario increased landscape connectivity by 3%, which could enhance the landscape network while still fulfilling the needs of redevelopment. This study illustrates the importance of considering landscape connectivity values of vacant land during the reuse process, and similar analysis could be applied in other cities to help incorporate existing ecological values during vacant land transformation decision-making.","Zhang, Pan","Fahey, Robert T.","Park, Sohyun",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING,Biodiversity,Ecological network,Forest management,Habitat,Post-industrial cities,LAND,FRAGMENTATION,NETWORKS,SYSTEM,SITES,FORM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,APR 2024,The importance of current and potential tree canopy on urban vacant lots for landscape connectivity
Row_285,"Climate change and urban growth have been shown to alter hydrological processes, particularly surface runoff. While there is widespread evidence of the combined effects of climate change and urban expansion on surface runoff at the watershed scale, little is known about their combined effects at different scales in large-scale urban agglomerations. Using integrated spatial models, we simulated the combined effects of climate change and urban growth on surface runoff in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, China, in 2030. We found that the surface runoff increased under both climate change and urban growth scenarios but the relative contributions of these two factors to surface runoff change varied from the regional to the sub-city scale. At regional and city scales, climate change was the main control on surface runoff change, while urban growth had the most effect on surface runoff change in the main urban areas of some cities, i.e., the sub-city scale. The results indicate that one single factor does not give reliable information for managing surface runoff in megacities, as the effects of other factors are ignored. These findings highlight that integrated solutions must be tailored to the appropriate spatial scale to effectively regulate surface runoff change across large-scale urban agglomerations.","Ju, Xinhui","Li, Weifeng","Li, Junran","He, Liang","Mao, Jingqiao","Han, Lijian",,,,,,,,,,,,,12,SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY,Climate change,Urban growth,Surface runoff,Scale effects,Urban agglomeration,LAND-USE CHANGE,HYDROLOGIC IMPACTS,ECOSYSTEM SERVICES,SPATIAL DYNAMICS,CLUE-S,URBANIZATION,MODEL,PRECIPITATION,SIMULATIONS,CYCLES,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2023,Future climate change and urban growth together affect surface runoff in a large-scale urban agglomeration

However, the impacts of promoting vegetation on microclimate and building heating load (BHL) are still inexplicit. This study validated the feasibility of a new-developed coupled model that linked ENVI-met and EnergyPlus, for predicting the microclimate and BHL in winter. The impacts of vegetation configuration changes on the performances of three typical urban blocks in Xi'an, a high-density city in the cold region of China, were then evaluated. When the leaf area index of green lands increased from 0.79 to 4.77 m2/m2, a decrease of 3.27 degrees C on mean radiant temperature, a decrease of 0.48 m/s on wind speed, and an increase of 0.47 degrees C on air temperature at the block scale could be observed. To the three blocks, the BHL of thermal zones in the height range of tree canopy increased by 7.16 %, 1.52 % and 3.57 % during a sunny day, and decreased by 2.80 %, 0.55 %, and 0.06 % during a cloudy day maximally. Overall, the evergreen vegetation produced negative impacts on the building energy efficiency of cold region cities.

Row_287,"Located in Southeast Brazil, the Paraiba do Sul River Basin is considered one of the most strategic in the country since it is the main source of fresh water for more than 14.3 million people. The population growth in recent decades, in combination with increased demand for water for industrial and agricultural activities, has generated concerns about how the combined effect of land uses and global climate change might affect water availability in the future. Once irrigation is one of the main water consumers, especially for paddy rice cultivation, in this study we used a crop simulation model to determine the water requirements of paddy rice under current and future climate conditions based on three different regionalized climate scenarios and for different land use and land cover change projections. In addition, we estimated water footprints for different irrigation and soil fertility strategies. Finally, we explored adaptation actions that can lead to more sustainable production. Projections indicate an increase in the productivity and efficiency of irrigated rice. Intermittent flooding proved to be an efficient alternative, rather than the traditional practice of continuous ponding. Most scenarios projected a gradual decrease in water footprint for rice cultivated using irrigation and soil fertility management. On the other hand, the water footprint under rainfed and non-optimum soil fertility resulted in higher water footprints. Due to changes in land use and land cover, mainly urban sprawl, the rice areas are expected to decrease in the future reducing the production in the region, which is expected to decrease by almost 10% in the period 2016-2035 and up to 38% in the period 2036-2055. This trend can be compensated by adopting sustainable practices in rice cultivation, such as rational soil fertility and water management, which can boost the current level of produc-tivity by 50% and reduce water use by up to 15%.","Martins, Minella A.","Tomasella, Javier","Bassanelli, Helio R.","Paiva, Ana Carolina E.","Vieira, Rita Marcia S.

Row_288,": Citizen science (CS) and remote sensing (RS) approaches have become more reliable, thus providing higher resolution and generating a large amount of environmental data. When considering urban environments, where fragment-ed and highly diverse landscapes are predominant, the combination of citizen science data and remote sensing techniques with species distribution models (SDM) can play a vital role in comprehensively investigating and evaluating urban biodi-versity. However, citizen science derived species distribution models for multiple avian species in dense and fragmented urban areas are rarely used. The study aims (I) to elaborate, whether CS driven SDMs can be effectively used in spatially complex urban environments; (II) to identify biodiversity hotspots and prioritize areas for nature conservation and (III) to examine, if existing protective areas correspond to species' hotspots. Therefore, Citizen science-based datasets of 26 breeding bird species over three years were obtained for this analysis in Germany's Ruhr Metropolis. Quality assurance, data thinning, and pseudo-absence simulations were performed. Spatial data from the ecosystem LiDAR project GEDI(Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation), climate data from the German Weather Service, and land use informa-tion from Copernicus were used as environmental predictors. Eleven different species distri-bution models (SDMs) were trained on species subselection by using Biomod2 for preliminary analysis. Overall model performance was evaluated via several metrics, including TSS (true skill statistics) and ROC (receiver operating characteristic). Finally, four species distribu-tion models were used for ensemble modelling. Subsequently, a species richness analysis was performed with the aim of identifying spots with high avian biodiversity. Overall, the CS-derived SDMs performed well, with high predictive power for all of the investigated species. Within the Ruhr Metropolis, approximately 6% (250 km(2)) of the terrain was identified as being highly suitable for avian diversity, inhabiting at least 17 out of 26 species. Predominantly within the core urban areas, high species richness was predicted on preserved brownfields and revitalized mine sites, as well as in the remnants of formerly demarcated regional greenbelts. Additionally, regions outside of the core area, which are part of the overarch-ing biotope network framework, proved to have high species richness capabilities for avian biodiversity. These findings aid in optimizing urban development concepts and (sub)urban green space management with respect to urban biodiversity conservation. Following the implications of the recently established Regional Biodiversity Strategy in the Ruhr Metropolis, this analysis demonstrates the importance of networked green spaces, their preservation and the need to close existing network gaps within the Ruhr Metropolis.","Buehrs, Malte","Zepp, Harald","Schmitt, Thomas",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,ERDKUNDE,Avian biodiversity,species distribution models,citizen science,urban ecology,Ruhr Area,animal geography,SPATIAL-PATTERN,BIRDS,RICHNESS,CONSERVATION,POPULATION,DIVERSITY,CITIES,SPACE,PERFORMANCE,PREVALENCE,,,,,,,,,,JUL-SEP 2024,EVALUATING URBAN BIODIVERSITY: EFFECTIVENESS OF CITIZEN SCIENCE DRIVEN SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS IN URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
Row_289,"Current studies on shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) and road congestion pricing (RCP) mainly focus on their independent effect on mobility, and rarely consider the joint impact of the two policies on accessibility. In light of this incentive, this paper establishes a bi-level programming model with multi-objective functions and multidecision variables to solve the joint optimal pricing problem of SAVs and RCP considering accessibility. Because of the complex relationship between the decision variables and the objective functions, the proposed bilevel programming model belongs to a black-box problem. A machine learning algorithm based on multiobjective Bayesian optimization was developed to solve the proposed model, by taking Jiangyin City as an empirical case study. The results show that the combined implementation of SAVs and RCP plays an essential role in enhancing the performance of land-use and transportation systems. However, this advantageous outcome relies on an appropriately appropriate pricing strategy. Failing to account for the influence of the pricing strategy on implementation efficacy, SAVs and RCP could result in a 22.2 % and 5.0 % degradation in regional accessibility and total flow time, respectively. In contrast, the joint optimal pricing strategy of SAVs and RCP can not only mitigate traffic congestion and improve transportation network efficiency but also optimize urban spatial distribution and promote compact urban development, ultimately achieving a 14.0 % improvement in regional accessibility and 18.5 % reduction in total flow time. Sensitivity analysis reveals that with the increase in SAV market penetration rate, regional accessibility sees a steady rise. Conversely, the total flow time initially escalates before experiencing a decline. The method proposed in this paper serves not only in determining the joint optimal pricing strategy of SAVs and RCP to enhance accessibility, but also in analyzing and optimizing the accessibility impact of other land-use and transportation policies.","Liu, Ao","Zhong, Shaopeng","Sun Jian, Daniel","Gong, Yunhai","Fan, Meihan","Song, Yan",,,,,,,,,,,,,2,CITIES,Shared autonomous vehicles,Road congestion pricing,Joint pricing,Accessibility,Integrated land use and transportation model,Multi -objective Bayesian optimization,Machine learning,LAND-USE,AUTOMATED VEHICLES,TRAFFIC CONGESTION,TRANSPORT POLICY,OPTIMIZATION,FUTURE,SIMULATION,MOBILITY,AUSTIN,MODEL,,,,,,,,,MAR 2024,Joint optimal pricing strategy of shared autonomous vehicles and road congestion pricing: A regional accessibility perspective
Row_290,"Implementation of nature into urban areas provides resting, breeding, watering, feeding and movement opportunities for urban wildlife, whose knowledge of spatial ecology is still incomplete. This article focuses on space use by urban wild boar Sus scrofa in the central part of the Bordeaux Metropolis (France). We used species distribution modelling to assess urban ecological niche of wild boars and to identify landscape features that they select or avoid. We created a database based on field surveys carried out on a sample of grid cells where evidence of boar presence was recorded. We used logistic regression models to predict wild boar presence in the study area. Our results showed that the probability of boar presence was driven by access to resources and modulated by avoidance of densely built-up areas. In contrast, urban boars appeared to be indifferent to habitat fragmentation and secondary roads. Finally, a large part of the urbanistic urban green frame of Bordeaux was likely to support wild boar. These results provide a first picture of the situation, but must be considered as a first stage of investigations on the spatial ecology of urban boars. They also need to be placed in a broader socio-ecological context. From a life science perspective, urban wild boars provide an excellent example of urban wildlife adaptation. However, human-wildlife coexistence also raises planning, management, socio-cultural and ethical issues. We argue that objectifying wildlife use of urban space is a prerequisite to implement meaningful management measures. With this in mind, we proposed and discussed a simple protocol that could be adapted to other species whose urban ranges are poorly known.","Marin, Carole","Couderchet, Laurent","Le Campion, Gregoire","Werno, Jerome",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,URBAN ECOSYSTEMS,Urban wildlife,Wild boar,Spatial ecology,Species distribution modelling,Socio-ecosystem,Human-wildlife coexistence,SUS-SCROFA L.,SPECIES DISTRIBUTION,CROP DAMAGE,HABITAT USE,SPACE,POPULATIONS,PATTERNS,BEHAVIOR,CITIES,DEER,,,,,,,,,,AUG 2024,"Wildlife and the city.

The Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) of China is a typical case to make up for the fact that the role of policy clusters in built-up land intensity (BLI) is not yet fully recognized. First, the intensive use policy clusters (IUPC) of the YREB have undergone evolutionary characteristics of growth, maturity and renewal since their formal birth in 2008. Second, quantitative evidence from time-series observations and policy simulations demonstrates an effective contribution of IUPC to BLI (an average 43.1% enhancement). Worryingly, however, despite the ""lifting benefit"", the BLI is expected to show a ""decreasing trend"". Finally, the combined results are fed back to the IUPC, showing that both the abundance and heterogeneity of the policy clusters affect the impact.

Row_292,"Green infrastructure (GI) has developed as a sustainable approach to the mitigation of urban floods. While machine learning (ML) models have exhibited advantages in urban flood simulation, their direct application to support the quantitative planning of GI at the city scale remains a challenge. To address this, an interpretable ML model based on support vector machine (SVM) and the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) approach is integrated with the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) in this study. The model is applied to the case of central Beijing, China, and demonstrates a robust performance with a high area under curve (AUC) value of 0.94. The results of the urban flood susceptibility assessment identify the urban-rural transition zone in the study area as being under a greater flood threat. Via model interpretation with SHAP, the dominant roles of GI and grey infrastructure (GrI) in preventing flood are revealed and the non-linear complementarity between the two is demonstrated to be more significant in study units with a GI proportion of less than 0.45. Supported by the NSGA-II-based optimization framework, optimal GI plans under different total implementations of GI are achieved, among which a solution with a 3.21% increase in the total GI area is selected as that with the best investment efficiency. The pattern of GI implementation is suggested to be dispersed and small-scale by model. This study provides a tool with broad application prospects, effectively integrating GI implementation with urban planning.

This study proposed a new approach to estimating CS in urban human settlements, building on an existing forestry biomass expansion factor (BEF)-based CS estimation approach, and tested it over Suwon, a city in South Korea. First, a tree canopy cover map was created using high resolution land cover data. The urban tree area ratio was then calculated to estimate the BEF-based CS (Step 1 CS), considering parameters from the national forest inventories. Since urban trees have different growing environments and characteristics than forests, the CS for human settlements (Step 2 CS) was estimated using Step 1 CS as well as structural and spectral information of trees from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and Sentinel -2 data via machine learning (ML) techniques. The dependent variable of the ML models was the difference between the Step 1 CS and the reference CS, which was calculated using field -measured data and existing allometric equations for urban areas. Using both LiDAR and Sentinel -2 information, the random forest model outperformed the other ML models tested, with an R2 of 0.884, a root mean squared error of 0.432 tC/900 m2, and a lower sampling strategy sensitivity. Feature analysis revealed that incorporating structural and spectral information resulted in a more reliable CS estimation by considering different tree environmental characteristics for each grid cell in the model. This data -driven model utilizes remote sensing and ML and can generate spatially explicit CS maps of large urban areas.

Taking Isfahan City in Iran as a typical case, this study developed a combined GIS-artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict the spatio-temporal contribution of low-width parks to poise pollution mitigation. The 30-min equivalent sound level was measured at 100 stations in six urban parks (with a total area of 55.84 ha) under stable and controlled winter and summer conditions.

These predictors were introduced to a multi-layer perceptron ANN model to identify and compare the most important noise alleviation variables among the selected predictors. The mean noise levels ranged from 67.23 to 70.57 dB. The number of vehicles showed an insignificant temporal difference, indicating that the noise source was relatively constant between the seasons. The ANN model performed satisfactorily in both seasons with SSE values of < 0.03. The Mann-Whitney U test showed a significant difference in the predicted noise levels between summer and winter.

In this paper, we present a novel 2.5D risk-aware path planning strategy with the aim of computing safe routes for UAS in urban areas. The proposed approach uses 2.5D risk maps to assess the risk to the population on the ground caused by UAS operations. Specifically, the 2.5D risk map consists of a multilayer structure discretizing the flight altitude and providing a simplified representation of the three-dimensional space. Thus, a 2.5D risk-aware path planning searches for the minimum risk path in the 2.5D risk map. The adopted risk-aware path planning is based on the well-known RRT* algorithm with the minimization of the overall risk in the risk map and the flight time. Furthermore, an energy-aware factor is also included in the cost function to obtain a more energy-efficient solution, avoiding excessive changes in altitude. The simulation results obtained considering a real-world scenario corroborate the proposed strategy.

However, the control effect of Best Management Practices (BMPs) for NPS pollution is not yet clear under future scenarios. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was coupled with the entropy-weighted method, global climate patterns and land-use data to explore the dynamic variations in total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) loads in the Jing River Basin during the baseline (2000-2020) and future periods (2021-2065), evaluate the pollution reduction effectiveness of individual and combined BMPs, and propose practical BMP configurations. Results indicate that a future trend of urban land expansion, particularly in the economic scenario (LU_SSP585), leads to weakened environmental ecosystems, while the sustainable scenario (LU_SSP126) exhibits more balanced land development. The MIROC-ES2L model demonstrates higher Taylor skill scores, forecasted significant increases in precipitation, maximum, and minimum temperatures under the SSP585 scenario. Spatial heterogeneity in TN and TP loads is notable, showing an upward trajectory in the future. The interaction between land-use and climate change has complex effects on TN and TP loads, with land-use-induced TN changes being relatively small (4.6 %) and TP changes substantial (24.3 %). The spatial distribution, under overlying effects, leans towards the influence of climate change, emphasizing its dominant role in TN and TP load variations. Distinct differences exist in the reduction of NPS pollution loads among different BMPs, with combined BMPs demonstrating superior effectiveness. The environmental-cost effectiveness trends of BMPs remain consistent across various future scenarios. RG (Return agricultural land to grass), RG + TT (Terracing), and RG + FR10 (Fertilizer reduction: 10 %) + GW (Grassed waterway) + FS (Filter strip) + TT emerge as the most effective single, double, and multiple BMP combinations, respectively.

We proposed a comprehensive model to assess the green quality of urban spatial development (GQUSD), focusing on the synergy of multi-dimensional objectives and the balance of multi-regional interests. The metropolitan city of Hangzhou was taken as an example. We included land consumption, vegetation loss and infrastructure cost as the inputs and the density of production and living activities as the outputs of spatial development. We developed a categorical Data Envelope Analysis (DEA) using geospatial big data and stratified optimization to evaluate the synergy of inputs-outputs at the finer level of spatial grids. Results: show a ""sandwich"" structure of the GQUSD in Hangzhou when considering green space and vegetation loss, and characterize four spatial typologies of agglomerated development, limited development, blinded development and low-potential development through the Bivariate Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) analysis.

Row_299,"Land use/land cover (LULC) change is an important driver of changes in hydrologic processes in watersheds. Many studies have focused on the disruptive effects of human activity-induced urban sprawl and increased impervious surfaces on river runoff and environmental flow (e-flow), and little has been reported on whether LULC changes can improve e-flow security. Therefore, we proposed a hypothesis on whether LULC optimization can improve the e-flow guarantee using the Shayinghe River watershed as an example. To test the hypothesis, we evaluated the runoff response and e-flow security status of seven LULC scenarios (four historical scenarios and three possible optimization scenarios) by constructing the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to establish the statistical relationship between a single LULC type and the e-flow guarantee rate (EGR) and e-flow deviation rate (EDR) and screened the best land optimization scenario for the Shayinghe River watershed. The results showed that: (1) forest land and grassland have positive effects on EGR, and LULC optimization can counteract the risk of dry season e-flow security caused by urban expansion and increased construction land to a certain extent; (2) construction land was the most active LULC type and inhibited the dry season flow and EGR of rivers, leading to moderate changes in the hydrological process of Shayinghe River; (3) the Grain for Green Project was the best LULC optimization scenario for the Shayinghe River basin, which converts 1342 km2 of cultivated land in the western part of the basin to forest land, resulting in the highest dry season EGR increases of 3.23 % and 2.26 % in Zhoukou and Fuyang, respectively. Our study proposes a relatively simple and easily replicable approach in other watersheds, providing a new reference for rational LULC planning and environmental flow protection in highly regulated watersheds.","Guan, Ronghao","Huang, Wei","Li, Yi","Zhu, Dayu","Liu, Xiaobo","Wang, Zhuowei","Song, Jiquan",,,,,,,,,,,,5,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Environmental flow,LULC changes,SWAT model,IHA-RVA method,Shayinghe River basin,RIVER-BASIN,RUNOFF,WATER,URBANIZATION,MODEL,MANAGEMENT,IMPACTS,CLIMATE,RISK,NONSTATIONARITY,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2023,Can land use/land cover optimization improve the environmental flow guarantee in regulated basins?
Row_300,"The Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon commonly occurs in cities worldwide and may affect the health of millions of people, especially during heatwaves. To design and propose mitigation strategies, accurate urban microclimate simulation tools are needed but retrieving information for creating reliable models is often challenging. Sensitivity (SA) and uncertainty (UA) analysis can help to achieve valuable information and to produce informed decisions even in an uncertain scenario. However, to date, that are few studies that perform SA and UA on microclimate models. In the present study, the Urban Weather Generator (UWG) software has been used to apply SA and UA to the city of Athens, Greece. The urban model is established by considering the variation of input parameters that may occur within three of the most diffused Local Climate Zones (LCZ) in city centers. Results showed that the highest average Urban Heat Island Intensity (UHII) is obtained in LCZ2 followed by LCZ3 and LCZ5 (2.92, 2.78 and 2.60 degrees C, respectively). However, due to the overlapping of UHII output values among different LCZs, it is not possible to state with absolute certainty that a ""lower"" LCZ corresponds to a higher UHII in a specific city. The SA confirmed that LCZ parameters such as building surface fraction, aspect ratio and mean height of buildings are the most influential ones in this case study. The percentage of buildings with an operating Air Conditioning system is also a key parameter in LCZ2, which however is also among the most uncertain ones. Thus, this value is required to be well established in future research.","Maracchini, Gianluca","Bavarsad, Fatemeh Salehipour","Di Giuseppe, Elisa","D'Orazio, Marco",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,SUSTAINABILITY IN ENERGY AND BUILDINGS 2022,Sensitivity analysis center dot Uncertainty analysis center dot Urban heat island center dot,Local climate zone center dot Urban weather generator,BUILDINGS,IMPACT,WAVES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023,Sensitivity and Uncertainty Analysis on Urban Heat Island Intensity Using the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) Schema: The Case Study of Athens
Row_301,"Systematic assessment of arable land use is a fundamental prerequisite to explore its sustainable development path. Agricultural infrastructure integrated with the tillage conditions and soil properties was used to evaluate the state of regional arable land use and its potential for sustainable productivity. We propose a combined weighting method integrating Delphi and entropy weights to consider both decision objectives and indicator attributes. The proposed approach takes into account both expertise and data feature, making the evaluating results more rational and applicable. The impacts of large-scale land use change and regional urban distribution on soil properties and agricultural infrastructure were also explored to develop more rational and differentiated conservation strategies. Our evaluation showed that 44% and 48% of the soil properties of arable land in Heilongjiang Province, China, are in the excellent or good grades, respectively, meaning that no or only minor remediation measures are needed to achieve optimum conditions. Agricultural infrastructure deserves more attention from the management than soil properties, as only 16% and 24% of area have the same excellent and good grades. The results of the evaluation with a combination of subjective and objective weights are closer to a normal distribution curve than if only expert weights are used, which confirms our hypothesis that the new weighting method is more reasonable. The newly proposed weighted design method and index provide a better understanding of the sustainable productivity of agricultural areas and have a promising application in large-scale black soil areas worldwide. The future rough growth strategy for resources will result in degradation and posed risks to regional ecological conservation. At the provincial level (up to 130 km), agricultural infrastructure declines and then rises as fields move away from cities, with the inflection point at 55 km. State-owned farms are mainly responsible for this inflection point, which shift the agents of arable land from small farmers to large capital, with remote arable land receiving more investment. The impact mechanisms of urbanization should be deeper explored to address the challenges for arable land conservation.","Ren, Shuyi","Song, Changqing","Ye, Sijing","Cheng, Feng","Akhmadov, Vakhit","Kuzyakov, Yakov",,,,,,,,,,,,,6,LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT,agricultural infrastructure evaluation,conservation practices,farmland development,land use systems,urbanization consequences,QUALITY INDICATORS,DEGRADATION,EXPANSION,SELECTION,SYSTEM,IMPACT,AREAS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2023,Land use evaluation considering soil properties and agricultural infrastructure in black soil region

However, the effects of landscape stability on NCP, in the context of active human modification, remain unclear. To address this issue, we chose the Wujiang River Basin in the Yangtze River Economic Belt of China as a study area and quantified landscape stability in 2000, 2010, and 2020 under different scenarios. Environmental protection and comprehensive development scenarios were simulated for 2030 using the patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model. For current and future scenarios, NCP were assessed in terms of indicators, which included habitat creation and maintenance (NCP1), regulation of freshwater (NCP6), and protection of soils (NCP8). Under the current status quo, urban expansion was 491.547 km2, and landscape stability showed a decreasing trend, with the mean value decreasing from 0.049 in 2000 to 0.015 in 2020. In future scenarios, landscape stability was highest under the comprehensive development scenario. In addition, in terms of changes in NCP, the high-value contributions declined by 16%-48% from 2000 to 2020. Our results clarified how NCP respond to landscape stability.

However, how to scientifically assess and zoning management of CLC in dryland oases remains an open question. In this study, a comprehensive analytical framework was established to assess the characteristics of land-use transformation and the potential for CLC using remotely sensed and geospatial data and spatial analysis methods, a multi-objective territorial differentiation model, and collaborative path for CLC in oasis villages was proposed. The following key results were obtained. (1) From 2009 to 2018, urban and rural settlements in the hinterland of the Weiku Oasis expanded by 40 km(2), and shrub forests and grasslands in the oasis-desert transition zone shrank substantially by 21.13 km(2). The newly cultivated farmland in the oasis-desert transition zone only offset 62.9% of the occupied farmland in the hinterland of the oasis. (2) The pattern of comprehensive rural land consolidation potential in the Weiku Oasis was consistent with territorial differentiation, with a gradient decrease from the hinterland of the oasis to the desert. The average potential for Comprehensive land consolidation (PCLC) index was 0.31.

Row_304,"Integrating landscape models into urban planning can promote the use of green infrastructure tools in cities, which are essential for meeting future sustainability requirements. The city of Curitiba, the capital of Parana & PRIME; State, Brazil, provides an opportunity to research methodologies related to habitat connectivity in urban areas. Our study aims to propose a network of greenways that connect the most ecologically relevant green areas. Our methodology integrates avian movement and environmental indicators to enhance urban ecology by leveraging the spatial characteristics of the landscape. In designing the path network, we adapted the parameters to fit the minimum cumulative resistance model, which was based on studies of birds in the urban environment and their dispersion behavior. Our findings indicated that impervious surfaces were the predominant land cover class in the city landscape, while larger forest fragments were primarily situated in the south and northwestern regions. By utilizing least-cost paths, we identified twenty-six priority areas that could be connected to form an ecological network spanning the landscape. Our analysis revealed that the path network was more densely distributed in peripheral areas, where the largest habitats were located, primarily within the city's green belt. Regarding land cover classes along the paths, we found that 39% consisted of forest, 25% of impervious surface, 19% of grass, 16% of bare soil, and 1% of water. Despite being highly urbanized, Curitiba possesses significant potential for restoring avian-related functional connectivity through the urban forest. To aid in the recovery and conservation of ecological corridors along the greenways, we developed a set of guidelines. The information gathered from this study may prove useful for future interventions in the city, and the proposed methodology could serve as a model for greenway planning in other urban areas.","Lopes, Iran J.

It is often presumed that surface runoff is the dominant mode of chloride transport from impervious surfaces to surface waters despite empirical evidence for soil and groundwater transport. Our project aimed to (1) estimate the hydrologic pathways for chloride transport in a small, urbanized catchment in the Northeastern United States; and (2) provide a critical evaluation of simulation routines commonly used to guide the management of deicing salts. We investigated possible variations in urban chloride pathways by monitoring stormwater discharge and chloride across a winter season with deicing salt spreading and snow accumulation and melt. We analyzed these time series with US EPA SWMM, which presumes chloride transport occurs exclusively via surface runoff into stormwater systems. We develop two parallel models: one using the base empirical temperature-index snow routines, and a second substituting a process-based snowmelt model. Each model was calibrated via the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation algorithm to both stormwater volumes and chloride mass. Both models adequately simulated water volumes but failed to reproduce observed chloride dynamics, suggesting substantial deicing salt movement through soils and groundwater as a major urban hydrologic pathway. The results of this study will inform the development of urban hydrologic fate and transport models and chloride best management practices.","Snarski, Joshua W.","Dietz, Michael","Helton, Ashley M.","Knighton, James",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING,Deicing salts,Stormwater management model (SWMM),Multi-objective calibration,Model development,Urban hydrology,ROAD SALT,SURFACE-WATER,URBAN,GROUNDWATER,CONTAMINATION,FRESH,INFILTRATION,TEMPERATURE,RETENTION,NITROGEN,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 1 2023,Potential Hydrologic Pathways of Deicing Salt Chloride Transport Evaluated with SWMM
Row_306,"Increasing the effective urban water storage capacity is one of a range of solutions to mitigate heat issues and flooding in urban areas and vegetation plays an important role in it. In this study, the regional-scale water storage capacity of four city clusters in China during the period 2009-2018 was estimated based on a four-source evapotranspiration (ET) model incorporated with urban water storage capacity (S) estimated on the basis of daily ET recession. Our results showed that simulated ET was consistent with four flux towers (R2 = 0.57, RMSE = 1.45 mm/d). The spatial distribution of S was similar to that of ET, and ranged from 2 to 28 mm. The influence of environmental drivers on the spatial pattern of S was explored using a machine learning technique, and the relative contribution of LAI (leaf area index) to the spatial pattern of S ranged from 11.59% to 27.56%. The effect of vegetation change on S in urban and non-urban areas showed an opposite relationship to the LAI change. However, the effect on S in urban and non-urban areas was reversed when vegetation was expanded to 1.25 times the existing mean, owing to the increase in vegetation dominating the change in urban Eb (soil evaporation) to a greater degree than for non-urban Eb. Urban areas in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and Chengdu-Chongqing would need to increase existing vegetation by 10%, 32%, 32%, and 28%, respectively, to store additional precipitation (above the mean annual precipitation) in high-precipitation years.

Row_307,"Increased demands for timber products remove carbon from forests, however previous literature has suggested that higher resulting prices could spur forestland expansion, ameliorating the forest carbon impacts. We examine the impacts on forest carbon from harvest increases with an empirical forest sector model, coupled with an econometric model of endogenous land use change that differentiates the impacts of population, income, and pine plantation rents among forest management types and non-forest land uses. We explore the sensitivity of forest area and carbon to a suite of scenarios by varying timber product demands combined with a sensitivity analysis on pine plantation responses to pine plantation rents. The econometric results show that pine plantation rents lead to increases in pine plantation area and that all non-urban land uses are negatively related to both per capita income and population. Scenario projections show that (1) higher pulpwood demands driven by wood pellets lead to lower forest carbon outcomes; (2) higher sawtimber demands exacerbate the known cycles in sawtimber prices and result in corresponding cycles in forest area and carbon. All scenarios show increases in forest carbon over time, though some scenarios increase faster than others. Within the study period, the highest forest carbon level is achieved by the high sawtimber demand and low pulpwood demand scenario. Long term growth cycles over the course of the projection period, however, lead to alternating forest carbon outcomes, indicating that conclusions about forest carbon depend on the projection length.","Henderson, Jesse D.","Abt, Robert C.","Abt, Karen L.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,Forest carbon,Wood pellets,Land-use change,Forest sector model,SOIL CARBON,DETERMINANTS,INVENTORY,IMPACTS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,Forest carbon under increasing product demand and land use change in the US Southeast

The resolutions were 12 km with the whole of China included and 3 km nested over the JJJ region. The observed daily precipitation data comprised the CN05.1 data set from China Meteorological Administration. First, RegCM4 with a hydrostatic dynamic core forced by the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM1.2-HR) that participated in CMIP6 was used to simulate the east Asia area at a resolution of 12 km. Next, the RegCM4 results with 12 km resolution forced RegCM4 with a non-hydrostatic dynamic core (RegCM4-NH) to run over the JJJ region with a 3 km convection-permitting scale through one-way nesting. The results showed that RegCM4 with a hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic core could obtain more detailed seasonal and annual precipitation in China and the JJJ region relative to MPI-ESM1.2-HR although their performance varied over different regions. RegCM4 with the community land surface model 4.5 (CLM4.5) generally performed better at simulating the mean and extreme precipitation over the four subregions of China than that with the Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme because of more detailed descriptions of land surface processes of CLM4.5. RegCM4-NH with convection-permitting resolution improved the simulations of heavy precipitation extremes over JJJ compared with RegCM4 with a hydrostatic core and resolution of 12 km. In addition, RegCM4-NH with CLM4.5 performed better at simulating heavy precipitation extremes over JJJ compared with all other simulations, with higher correlation coefficients and larger relative root mean squared errors.","Qin, Peihua","Xie, Zhenghui","Jia, Binghao","Di, Zhenhua","Wang, Longhuan","Li, Ruichao",,,,,,,,,,,,,1,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY,CMIP6,convection permitting,precipitation extreme,regional climate model,COUPLED MODEL,RAINFALL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 15 2023,Performance of regional climate model RegCM4 with a hydrostatic or non-hydrostatic dynamic core at simulating precipitation extremes in China
Row_309,"Over the past few decades, environmental contamination from plastics has received considerable attention from scientists, policymakers, and the public. Although some models successfully simulated the transport and fate of plastic debris in freshwater systems, a complete model of the dynamics of plastics in rivers on a global scale has yet to be elucidated. Recently, two process-based eco-hydrology models, NICE and NICE-BGC, were applied to evaluate biogeochemical cycling in a range of river basins on scales ranging from local/regional to continental/ global. This effort provided insights into the quantification of the role of inland waters on global biogeochemical cycles, but was limited in its treatment of plastic dynamics. Here, we linked NICE-BGC to a plastic debris model that accounts for both the transport and fate of plastic debris (advection, dispersion, diffusion, settling, dissolution and biochemical degradation by light and temperature). We evaluated spatio-temporal variations of plastic debris in the world's major rivers (325 rivers) by simulating the amount of plastic that flows from land into rivers and finally into the ocean. Our NICE-BGC simulations show how diffuse sources of mismanaged plastic waste (MPW) and point sources of tyres, personal care products (PCPs), dust, and laundry in these 325 rivers are transported from land to rivers, and finally to the ocean. We compare continental-scale simulated plastic transport from agricultural and urban land uses to previous studies. Our model results confirm previous assessments that flood events have a great impact on the mobilisation of plastic and lead to high interannual variability in fluxes. The use of ""untreated wastewater"" and the simulation of a two-dimensional diffusion model for macro-plastic transport helped to decrease the uncertainty of the model beyond previous studies that included only sewerage connectivity, removal efficiency, and transport probability. Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses using Monte Carlo model simulations also clarified that most plastic fluxes originate in 20 global rivers, largely in Asia, and are greatly influenced by the effects of the summer monsoon. The new model presented here may be valuable for to detecting and predicting the dynamics of plastic in large rivers and to the development of efficient measures to reduce plastic input to the ocean on a global scale.","Nakayama, Tadanobu","Osako, Masahiro",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,17,GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE,Plastic debris,Eco-hydrology model,Global river basins,Untreated wastewater,CARBON-CYCLE,MISSING ROLE,WATER,RESERVOIRS,TRANSPORT,MICROPLASTICS,ENVIRONMENTS,FRAMEWORK,DATABASE,EXPORT,,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 2023,The flux and fate of plastic in the world's major rivers: Modelling spatial and temporal variability
Row_310,"Most land use/cover change (LUCC) models use socioeconomic predictors which spatially approximate human influence on the landscape. According to our meta-analysis, the simplest spatial approximations - the minimal Euclidean distance and indicators based on administrative areas - are used most often. We argue that these approximators are theoretically unjustified for a significant portion of LUCC research designs, mainly because the Euclidean distance ignore other factors influencing transportation costs and the administrative areas often have insufficient spatial resolution or unrepresentative shape. We introduce improvements which overcome these theoretical challenges: improved slope-based cost distance and exposure to human influence as a variant of potential accessibility. The exposure is modified to be measured in activity-per-area units (e.g., population/km2), which are easier to interpret and compare with other socioeconomic indicators (e.g., population density) than standard potential accessibility units. Logistic regression was used to quantify the predictive power of these alternative approximators within different LUCCs in Slovakia, across three time periods. Their performance (AUC) was compared with standard predictors in polynomial models, and their contribution when combined with biophysical predictors was evaluated using hierarchical partitioning. In line with the study's theoretical assumptions, cost distance and exposure significantly surpassed the standard approximators of human influence in most comparisons. They achieved a relatively good performance even for some LUCCs (pastures, permanent cultures, forests, agricultural extensification and intensification, afforestation) where standard socioeconomic indicators were weak. These indicators thus showed potential to improve the precision of LUCC models, particularly in mountainous regions.","Druga, Michal","Minar, Jozef",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,LAND USE POLICY,Land use cover change,Socioeconomic determinants,Population density,Exposure to human influence,Comparable units,Slovakia,LAND-USE CHANGE,SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES,URBAN-GROWTH,CELLULAR-AUTOMATA,DRIVING FORCES,COVER CHANGE,TRANSFORMATION MODEL,HABITAT QUALITY,USE PATTERNS,SIMULATION,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2023,Cost distance and potential accessibility as alternative spatial approximators of human influence in LUCC modelling
Row_311,"This paper investigates the interactions between sidewalk delivery robots and pedestrians in urban settings to evaluate pedestrian safety and robot efficiency in shared spaces. We developed a 3D digital twin environment model that allows realistic simulation of robot-human and robot-cityscape interactions, adopting the Pedestrian Aware Model (PAM) to ensure effective and safe navigation. Using an agent-based modeling approach, we analyze various scenarios involving pedestrians, wheelchair users, and robots sharing sidewalk spaces. Our findings reveal that robots do not inherently contribute to sidewalk congestion and can be programmed to maintain a buffer zone that allows for both safety and efficiency, suggesting their potential for smooth coexistence with pedestrians. We observed that robots caused most collisions, while pedestrians were primarily responsible for proximity violations of minimum distance thresholds, emphasizing the need for further research and strategies to reduce further the risks associated with these incidents. The results suggest that with careful design-oriented planning and continued research, robots can safely and comfortably share sidewalks with pedestrians, contributing to a more harmonious and efficient urban landscape. Our proposed simulation model can assist urban planners, policymakers, and researchers in evaluating the influence of various design interventions and policies on human-robot coexistence in cities, marking a crucial step toward accommodating both humans and robots in urban spaces.","Hassan, Ali","Usman, Muhammad","Kremer, Melissa","Yang, Seungho","Luubert, Michael","Faloutsos, Petros","Hall, G.

Previous studies of urban precipitation have largely considered single precipitation events, with few long-term statistical studies based on multiple samples. Therefore, based on WRF model simulations, this study extracted the latent heat flux, sensible heat flux, net radiation, friction velocity, albedo, and precipitation of 156 urban units in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (Jing-Jin-Ji) urban agglomeration for the summers of 2001-2019, and identified the main factors driving long-term urban precipitation changes based on multiple samples. There were three key results. 1) The factors that had the greatest impact on urban precipitation changes in Jing-Jin-Ji were the sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, and friction velocity. The latent heat flux was the leading factor driving precipitation changes during the urbanization of Jing-Jin-Ji. 2) In the different stages of urbanization, there were different factors affecting urban precipitation changes. In highly urbanized cities, the sensible heat flux had the greatest impact on precipitation changes, followed by the friction velocity. For medium-sized cities, the friction velocity was the most important variable. For small cities, the latent heat flux was the most important factor. 3) The friction velocity was the leading factor in precipitation change at the 0.95 quantile in Jing-Jin-Ji, and was therefore the most important factor driving changes in urban extreme precipitation. The results provide a theoretical basis for the formulation of climate policies, and disaster prevention and mitigation in Jing-Jin-Ji.

Row_313,"Built environment attributes (BEAs) play a significant role in influencing urban heat resilience (UHR). Previous research has examined the correlations and nonlinear relationships between BEAs and both land surface temperature (LST) and urban heat island (UHI) effects. Nevertheless, the investigation into the nonlinear effects of BEAs on UHR remains underexplored. Furthermore, the advantages of explainable machine learning in elucidating the mechanisms through which BEAs affect the urban thermal environment have been extensively validated. Consequently, taking Beijing, a highly urbanized city, as a case, we conducted an empirical study to investigate the nonlinear effects of BEAs on UHR. We first operationalized UHR as the differential in LST between extreme heat waves and normal heat days. Secondly, we constructed a set of influencing factors covering BEAs and control variables. Subsequently, by integrating the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), the nonlinear relationships between BEAs and UHR are uncovered. The results demonstrate that: 1) Nonlinear relationships between BEAs and UHR are prevalent, as well as threshold effects. 2) Greening is the key BEA affecting UHR, accounting for 22.39% in contribution, with which increase, UHR increases at an accelerating rate. 3) From the city center outward, the growth of UHR exhibits a leapfrog effect, with the growth rate in the outer ring being 2.7 times that of the inner one. 4) Interactions between BEAs impact UHR. Our findings unveil the complex nonlinear effects of BEAs on UHR, clarifying the priority and optimal quantity thresholds of BEAs.

Row_314,"The enhancement of the living conditions in big cities since the end of the last century is closely related to changes in the thermal environment and besides in urban microclimate, particularly for metropolitan areas. In this context, a knowledge of the spatial and temporal variability of urban heat island (UHI) became an increasing matter of concern, which can be measured from land surface temperature (LST). Actually, LST can be derived from thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing observations to ensure the necessary spatial and time frequency coverage. But a full exploitation of satellite TIR data cannot be achieved without accounting for the strong anisotropy of urban landscape. Hitherto, a poor investigation was focused on the modeling and the analysis of the directional anisotropies of LSTs considering the complexity of urban building surfaces (e.g., heterogeneity of building morphology and temperature distribution) whereas it is fundamental to establish reliable critical indicators derived from energy balance. Herein, we propose an analytical model to simulate the angular signatures of urban temperatures, in which the geometric optical theory is considered to model the direct radiances of the main components (i.e., sunlit and shaded street, roof and wall). The built model assumes a random distribution of low/middle-rise and high-rise buildings, which depicts realistically the heterogeneity of urban architectural distribution. We evaluated the proposed model using both measured datasets from airborne and satellite sensors and a simulated dataset from a 3D ray-tracing model so-called discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART). Results indicate that 1) the proposed model is effective for simulating directional anisotropies of LSTs, with a root mean square error (RMSE) lower than 0.90 C and R-2 > 0.49 for comparison with measured datasets; and 2) the directional anisotropies of LSTs are significantly affected by variations in building height, with values possibly exceeding 1.5 degree celsius. The proposed model can be perceived as a useful tool to analyze the contribution of each component and to assess the impact of urban structure. Furthermore, it can serve to improve urban radiation budget estimations in mixed pixels.","Bian, Zunjian","Fan, Tengyuan","Roujean, J. -L","Wang, Dandan","Irvine, Mark","Wu, Shengbiao","Cao, Biao","Li, Hua","Du, Yongming","Xiao, Qing","Liu, Qinhuo",,,,,,,,2,REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT,Urban temperature,Radiative transfer,Directional anisotropies,Energy budget,Analytical model,THERMAL INFRARED MEASUREMENTS,LAND-SURFACE TEMPERATURE,DIRECTIONAL ANISOTROPY,LONG-TERM,RADIATIVE-TRANSFER,LEAF TEMPERATURE,VEGETATION,MODIS,EMISSIVITY,CANOPY,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 1 2024,An analytical urban temperature model with building heterogeneity using geometric optical theory

This integration enables the simulation of spatiotemporal distributions and inter-media transfer fluxes of PAHs among six different media from the 2010s to the 2100s under two distinct Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP) scenarios in the megacity of Shanghai, China. The MUM model, featuring diverse gridded parameters, effectively captures PAH concentrations and movement across environmental compartments. Results indicate a decreasing trend in PAHs concentrations in the 2100s compared to the 2010s, with PAH concentrations in water, sediment, vegetation, and organic film covering impermeable surfaces under the SSP3-7.0 scenario higher than those of the SSP1-2.6 scenario. Low molecular weight PAHs dominate in the sediment, water, and air, whereas high molecular weight PAHs prevail in the organic film, vegetation, and soil. Sediment and soil serve as the predominant sinks for PAHs. The primary transport processes for PAH movement include air-film, air-soil, film-water, soil-air, and water-air. Almost all transfer fluxes exhibit a declining trend in future periods except for the air-film transport pathway. The principal input and removal routes for PAHs in Shanghai involve the advection of air and water. The study provides essential insights into the environmental behavior of PAHs and informs targeted pollution control in Shanghai. Additionally, it serves as a technical reference for similar pollution prediction research.","Li, Ting","Nie, Ning","Miao, Yiyi","Zhao, Dengzhong","Liu, Min",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,The Science of the total environment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-Oct-01,"Spatiotemporal distribution and inter-media transfer of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Shanghai, China: Historical patterns and future trends."
Row_316,"To fill the lack of overall planning and unreasonable distribution of urban vertical greening, a method for extracting vertical distribution characteristics of high-density urban greening systems was proposed in this study. A remote sensing image acquisition platform was built with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect greening system images. A convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was established to remove initial image noise through residual learning. The tasseled hat transformation algorithm was used to rotate the image structure axis to enhance the image and highlight the image details. According to the similarity and discontinuity of the spectrum, a data-driven algorithm was used to establish a homogeneity standard, and the image was divided into different areas to ensure that the same target was in the same area. The vertical distribution characteristics of the greening system were extracted from three aspects: spectrum, shape, and texture. The experimental results showed that in the target area, the vertical distribution characteristics of the commercial area and the residential area were similar, but the green area of the residential area was larger, and the plant species in the commercial area were more abundant. According to the extracted features, the greening system can be a reference for further study.","He, Y.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2023 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Social Sciences and Intelligence Management (SSIM),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023,Vertical Distribution Feature Extraction of Virtual Simulation Greening System by UAV-A Case Study of High-Density Cities
Row_317,"Rapid urbanization has reduced the capacity of cities to mitigate and withstand disasters. Strengthening urban ecological resilience (ER) is important for improving urban self-organization. Geographical characteristics and developmental status of different cities lead to a more complex relationship between urbanization and ER. Using the three major urban agglomerations in China, we constructed a new framework for assessing the ER from a landscape and ecological processes perspective, and analyzed the driving heterogeneity of urbanization on ER. The results indicated that the ER of Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Pearl River Delta (PRD) decreased continuously from 2000 to 2018, while the ER of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) decreased from 2000 to 2010, and then increased from 2010 to 2018. The resilience level of PRD was significantly lower than those of BTH and YRD. The urbanization process had a negative impact on ER, and the contribution of urbanization factors to ER varied significantly across cities, and population factors have the most direct influence. Curve fitting analysis further deepened our understanding of heterogeneity, investigating from the perspective of landscape and driving factors, and suggesting improvement measures. This study can deepen the understanding of the impact of urbanization on resilience and provide scientific guidance for achieving regional sustainability.","Zhang, Teng","Sun, Yixuan","Zhang, Xiaobo","Yin, Le","Zhang, Baolei",,,,,,,,,,,,,,28,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,Morphology -density -coordination,Ecological resilience,Urbanization,Urban agglomerations,Driving factors analysis,POPULATION,CHINA,EXPANSION,REGION,DELTA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 15 2023,Potential heterogeneity of urban ecological resilience and urbanization in multiple urban agglomerations from a landscape perspective
Row_318,"Quantifying urban tree cover is important to ensure sustainable urban ecosystem. This study calculates urban percent tree cover (PTC) for Bursa city, Turkey from Sentinel-2 data and evaluates the driving factors of PTC using an Artificial Neural Network-Multi Layer Perception (ANN-MLP) approach. For the PTC calculation, a Regression Tree (RT) analysis was performed using several vegetation indices (NDVI, LAI, fCOVER, MSAVI2, and MCARI) to improve accuracy. Socio-economic, topographic, and biophysical variables were incorporated into the ANN-MLP approach to evaluate the factors that drive urban PTC. A PTC prediction map was generated with an accuracy of 0.95 and a coefficient of determination of 0.87. The ANN-MLP training process yielded a correlation coefficient value of 0.71 and an R-square of 0.82 was achieved between the predicted ANN-MLP and observed tree cover maps. A priority tree cover map was generated considering statistical relationships between the factors and the ANN-MLP prediction map in addition to visual interpretations at the urban scale. Results demonstrate that, unlike other urban forms, PTC has a statistically negative relationship with the gross dwelling density (R2 =0.31). Topographic variables including slope and DEM were positively correlated with PTC with the R2 value of 0.80 and 0.72 respectively.

Row_319,"Afforestation projects in urban areas have generally prospered in China. Although urban forests play an important role in sequestering carbon (C) at local to regional scales, understanding the current role of C-sink strength in urban forests is generally absent. We used continuous eddy-covariance and hydrometeorological data from 2012 to 2020 acquired from an urban forest reserve in Beijing to assess the interannual variability (IAV) in C-fluxes, as well as their key controlling factors. Over the study period, the urban forest was mostly a C-sink, maintaining a mean net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of-195 +/- 98 g C m- 2 yr-1. Interannual variability in NEE was largely due to variation in ecosystem respiration (Re). Interannual variation in annual gross ecosystem pro-duction (GEP) and Re were controlled to a large extent by summer soil water content (SWC). Since the effects of SWC on GEP and Re partially offset their individual responses, IAV in annual NEE was seen as being less influenced by summer SWC. Annual NEE was constrained by changes in summer air temperature (Ta). Residuals based on a Re-to-SWC regression exhibited significant decreases with increasing summer Ta, appreciably more than the residuals based on GEP-to-SWC regressions. This underscored the importance of summer Ta in impacting annual NEE through the suppression of Re, rather than through GEP. Our analysis also revealed that Re was more affected by drought than GEP. Long-lasting drought, greater than one month, was seen to impact GEP and Re more than short-term drought. Our study might imply that irrigation by elevating SWC was not be an effective strategy improving NEE of urban forest. Under anticipated climate change, drought and attendant high tem-peratures would impact C-fluxes more in the future.

Row_320,"LiDAR is a developed technology that has been widely used to measure the Earth's surface by acquiring accurate three-dimensional (3D) information. DART (Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer) model developed a new LiDAR modeling method based on the Monte Carlo bidirectional path tracing mode named DART-Lux. Using the DART-RC (Ray Carlo) mode as a reference, DART-Lux shows consistency and efficiency for LiDAR signal modeling. This paper presents a further validation of DART-Lux LiDAR model for simulating actual LiDAR waveform and photon-counting measurements by considering two in-orbit spaceborne LiDAR systems: GEDI (Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation) and ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2). The validation experiments are conducted on accurate 3D descriptions of an urban landscape in Toulouse, France, and a natural forest landscape in Saihanba, China. The pulse-by-pulse comparisons of GEDI and simulated waveforms yield mean R2 = 0.893, mean RMSE = 0.077. The simulated ICESat-2 photon counting shows accuracies of signal photon frequency (R2 = 0.950, RMSE = 0.465 pts./pulse) and noise photon frequency (R2 = 0.820, RMSE = 0.247 pts./pulse). Results in GEDI and ICESat-2 overlapping footprints illustrate the usefulness of DART-Lux for studying their height retrieval inconsistency. Furthermore, sensitivity studies conducted with DART-Lux reveal performance and limitation of GEDI and ICESat-2 in height measurement.

Row_321,"Understanding the multiscale impacts and drivers of urban agglomeration landscape patterns for ecosystem services (ESs), especially water-related ecosystem services (WESs), is essential for the development of regional ecological management. However, the multiscale impacts and driving mechanisms of urban agglomeration landscape patterns for ESs have not been adequately explained. In this study, multivariate data were employed, and the InVEST model, trend test method, coupled GeoDetector and geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) method were utilized to comprehensively explore the spatial and temporal changes in landscape patterns and WESs in the Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration (PRDUA) at various grid and administrative scales from 1990 to 2020 and to determine the driving mechanisms affecting WESs. The results indicated that the variation characteristics of landscape patterns and WESs in the PRDUA were consistent, forming a binary spatial structure of core and peripheral areas in an inverted ""U"" shape around the estuary of the Pearl River. The relationship between landscape patterns and WESs weakened with the increase of scale, and the correlation coefficient decreased by approximately 0.10 from 5 km to 10 km grid scale. Additionally, precipitation (PRE) was the main factor controlling WESs changes in the PRDUA, explaining more than 50% of the changes in WESs, and the regression coefficients ranged from 0.0825 to 0.1584. Changes in WESs were the result of the combined effects of natural factors, including PRE, landscape pattern, elevation, slope, and socioeconomic factors, such as population and gross domestic product (GDP). Overall, these findings could contribute to optimizing regional landscape patterns and fostering sustainable development of the ecological environment in urban agglomerations.The paper focuses on addressing the impacts of landscape heterogeneity at different spatial scales on regional water-related ecosystem services (WESs) in a rapidly urbanizing, integrated urban agglomeration region and the mechanisms driving. image","Huang, Lie","Chen, Xiaohong","Ye, Changxin","Yuan, Ze","He, Kunlong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,influence mechanisms,landscape heterogeneity,spatial scales,urban agglomerations,water-related ecosystem services,PEARL RIVER DELTA,LAND-USE,PATTERN,CHINA,SCALE,SIMULATION,DYNAMICS,IMPACTS,CLIMATE,REGION,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 2024,Multiscale effects and drivers of landscape heterogeneity for water-related ecosystem services in urban agglomerations
Row_322,"Land use land cover plays an essential role in altering regional micro and macro climate, diminishing biodiversity, and significantly influences Land Surface Temperature (LST). However, no research has been conducted in the Shigar district to investigate LULC changes, particularly the correlation between LST and vegetation/snow cover at higher elevated regions. Therefore, this study was carried out in the Shigar district of Gilgit Baltistan Region, Pakistan, due to its extreme climatic variability. In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal variability of LULC and its impacts on LST in the Shigar district, utilizing Landsat data from 1993 to 2020. To study the variable LST, thermal bands of Landsat imagery were used. LULC was determined by classifying the images using the supervised maximum likelihood classification method. The vegetation and snow cover were also extracted by using the indices of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI), respectively. The results showed that the Shigar district had experienced severe land cover variations in the years of 1993, 2003, 2010, and 2020. Specifically, the agricultural area gradually increased from 1993 to 2020. The forest/vegetation cover also increased in the study area. In contrast, snow cover and water bodies were drastically reduced during this period. The overall vegetation increased within the region and the LST values were found to be decreased in 2003 and 2010, whereas the LST rose in 2020. In addition, the correlation between NDVI and LST was found to be significant negative in areas with high vegetation cover. Conversely, it was weakly positive in other areas with minor vegetations. These findings suggest that green cover plays a crucial role in regulating temperature. Additionally, a negative correlation between LST and NDSI was observed with rising elevation. This study will be helpful in landscape and urban planning, watershed management, and policymaking for climate change variability.","Khan, Moazzam Ali","Yang, Mengmeng","Khan, Mariam","Khan, Tariq Masood Ali","Khan, Faisal Ahmed","Sulman, Nasir","Tian, Hongzhen","Liu, Dong","Fang, Hua",,,,,,,,,,0,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,Land use land cover (LULC),Land surface temperature (LST),Normal difference vegetation index (NDVI),Normal difference snow index (NDSI),Elevation,Landsat,Shigar,SIMULATION,ACCURACY,DYNAMICS,REGION,GIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2024,"Assessment of spatiotemporal land use land cover changes and its impacts on land surface temperature in the Shigar district of Gilgit Baltistan, Pakistan"

In this paper, we integrate the System Dynamics Model (SD), the Future Land Use Simulation (FLUS) model, the Integrated Valuation and Trade-offs of ESs (InVEST) model, and the Structural Equation Model (SEM). We select three scenarios, SSP1-1.9, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5, from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) to forecast future changes under these scenarios in the Yellow River Basin (YRB) by 2030. We predict future changes in water yield (WY), carbon storage (CS), soil retention (SR), and habitat quality (HQ) in the YRB. The results show that: (1) Under the SSP1-1.9 scenario, ecological land types such as forests, grasslands, and water bodies are protected and restored to a certain extent; under the SSP2-4.5 scenario, the degree of land spatial development occupies an intermediate state among the three scenarios; and under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, there is an obvious increase in the artificialization of the watershed's land use. (2) Under scenario SSP1-1.9, there is a comprehensive approach to sustainable development that significantly improves all ESs in the watershed, while the SSP5-8.5 and SSP2-4.5 scenarios demonstrate an increase in trade-offs between WY, HQ, and CS, especially in the downstream area.

Row_324,"Enhancing urban resilience represented a viable strategy to mitigate flooding induced by intense human activities and climate change. However, existing studies often concentrated on system attributes or isolated resilience characteristics, failing to offer a holistic evaluation of urban flood resilience performance. Thus, it was imperative to develop a comprehensive flood resilience framework that incorporated the resilience evolution process including resistance, economic and function recovery. Consequently, this study endeavored to devise a synthesized framework for evaluating urban flood resilience, subsequently employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for simulation. The findings indicated that: (1) Guangzhou's maximum resistance capacity diminished from 0.52 to 0.50 as rainfall return periods altered, while Dongguan exhibited the lowest resistance, decreasing from 0.42 to 0.40. Regarding functional recovery capacity, Guangzhou ranked highest (0.35) and Foshan lowest (0.19); (2) according to Triangular Fuzzy Number-based AHP (TFN-AHP) analysis, the area classified as highest in resilience decreased from 15.6% to 12.1% of the total, whereas the low resilience area increased from 7.6% to 8.7%; (3) Zhuhai and Zhaoqing were primarily clustered along the resistance axis, in contrast, Dongguan was distinguished by its advancement along the axis of functional recovery.(4) CNN simulations yielded precise outcomes, with the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) and predictive accuracy (ACC) values exceeding 0.8,respectively.

Row_325,"Heavy metal (HM) contamination severely restricts the safe utilization of selenium (Se)-rich soil. Based on 10 HMs in 3933 topsoil samples from Se-rich soils in Hainan Province, we used the enrichment factor (EF) to evaluate the pollution level of soil HMs; moreover, the positive matrix factorization (PMF), multivariate sta-tistical analysis, and geostatistics were utilized to quantify the sources of soil HMs; and potential ecological risk index (RI) and human health risk (HHR) of different sources from five land use types were quantifiably deter-mined via combined HM sources with RI and HHR assessment models. The evaluation results of EF showed that the Se-rich soils were moderate enrichment of Hg and Sb, but they were still characterized by lower content compared to other regions of the world. And four sources were quantitatively identified as natural sources (40.8 %), industrial sources (22.3 %), agricultural sources (23.6 %), and atmospheric sources (13.3 %). For RI, the atmospheric source was the main anthropogenic contributor to plowland, urban land, woodland, and unused land with 24 %, 30 %, 25 %, and 26 %, respectively, and Hg was the most dangerous element. But the contri-bution of industrial sources (25 %) to RI in the garden-land was higher than that of atmospheric sources (23 %). In terms of HHR, industrial sources were the primary anthropogenic contributors. Children were exposed to slight health risks, with Cr, As and Pb being the major contributors, and the cumulative probability of non-cancer and cancer risks for children was 14.93 % and 25.29 %, respectively. The cancer risk for children in garden-land (1.2E-04) and plowland (1.3E-04) exceeded the threshold (1.0E-04), which requires attention. Both non-cancer and cancer risks for adults were all at acceptable levels, with only a 15.89 % cumulative probability of cancer risk. Overall, the health risks of children were clearly higher than those of adults, and plowland and garden-land were at higher HMs risk than other land use types. The HMs risks in the study area were profoundly affected by the basalt, while the input of HMs from anthropogenic activities should be prioritized for the control of industrial activities.","Fu, Zhongbiao","He, Ningjie","Ma, Ming","Bao, Zhengyu","Xie, Shuyun","Gu, Yansheng",,,,,,,,,,,,,7,JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION,Heavy metals,Selenium-rich soil,Risk assessment,Source apportionment,Monte Carlo simulation,HUMAN HEALTH-RISKS,ATMOSPHERIC EMISSIONS,SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION,TOXIC ELEMENTS,GUANGDONG PROVINCE,TRACE-METALS,SEDIMENTS,CONTAMINATION,VALUES,COUNTY,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 2023,"Source apportionment and probabilistic risk assessment of heavy metals in selenium-rich soils in Hainan Province, China"

Identification of NO3- sources and biogeochemical processes is a crucial step in managing and controlling NO3- pollution. In this study, land use, hydrochemical data, dual stable isotopic ratios and Bayesian Stable Isotope Mixing Models (BSIMM) were integrated to identify NO3- sources and estimate their proportional contributions to the contamination of the Karaj Urban Aquifer (Iran). Elevated NO3- concentrations indicated a severe NO3- pollution, with 39 and 52% of groundwater (GW) samples displaying the concentrations of NO3- in exceedance of the World Health Organization (WHO) standard of 50 mg NO3- L-1 in the rainy and dry seasons, respectively. Dual stable isotopes inferred that urban sewage is the main NO3- source in the Karaj Plain. The diagram of NO3-/Cl- versus Cl- confirmed that municipal sewage is the major source of NO3-. Results also showed that biogeochemical nitrogen dynamics are mainly influenced by nitrification, while denitrification is minimal. The BSIMM model suggested that NO3- originated predominantly from urban sewage (78.2%), followed by soil organic nitrogen (12.2%), and chemical fertilizer (9.5%) in the dry season. In the wet season, the relative contributions of urban sewage, soil nitrogen and chemical fertilizer were 87.5, 6.7, and 5.5%, respectively. The sensitivity analysis for the BSIMM modeling indicates that the isotopic signatures of sewage had the major impact on the overall GW NO3- source apportionment. The findings provide important insights for local authorities to support effective and sustainable GW resources management in the Karaj Urban Aquifer. It also demonstrates that employing Bayesian models combined with multi-parameters can improve the accuracy of NO3- source identification.","Zaryab, Abdulhalim","Alijani, Farshad","Knoeller, Kay","Minet, Eddy","Musavi, Seyedeh Fatemeh","Ostadhashemi, Zohreh",,,,,,,,,,,,,1,ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH,Groundwater,Nitrate,Stable isotopes,Karaj urban aquifer,Sensitivity analysis,DUAL-ISOTOPE APPROACH,STABLE-ISOTOPES,LAND-USE,UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS,CONTAMINANT SOURCES,POLLUTION SOURCES,DRINKING-WATER,MIXING MODEL,DELTA-O-18,DELTA-N-15,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 2024,"Identification of groundwater nitrate sources in an urban aquifer (Alborz Province, Iran) using a multi-parameter approach"

By employing small variations in the longwave emissivity of buildings within the UCM, 11 convective-permitting experiments are conducted. The maximal 18-hr and hourly rainfall accumulation vary from a 2-year return period to as high as a 20 or 40-year return period with notable spatial differences. Comparisons between the more accurate group (GOOD) and less accurate group (POOR) simulations highlight that some minor differences in the near-surface air thermodynamic conditions in urban area could lead to substantial differences in local convection and its impacts on subsequent convective systems. With persistent transportation of warm, moist airflows from the northern South China Sea, formation of a slow-moving mesoscale outflow boundary to the north of the urban agglomeration leads to the development of a quasi-stationary, compactly structured meso-gamma-scale rainstorm in the GOOD simulations. The stronger low-level to near-surface convergence and mid-level cyclonic shear within this system substantially enhance low-level updrafts, leading to increased microphysical production and stronger horizontal advection of rainwater within the system. These findings offer some process-based understanding about the uncertainties in simulating urban extreme rainfall and underscore the need to develop ensemble forecasting methods for convection-permitting numerical models that incorporate increasingly complicated representations of anthropogenic influences.Precise forecasting of extreme precipitation in cities is an urgent need for hazards mitigation, but very challenging. It is unclear how well the state-of-the-art numerical models with the most advanced representations of natural and anthropogenic physical processes can simulate urban extreme precipitation. Therefore, we conduct 11 experiments with small variations in a physical parameter of buildings to simulate an extreme rainfall influencing Guangzhou city using a state-of-the-art coupled model with very high resolutions to resolve the initiation and propagation of extreme rainfall-producing convection. We find the small changes in the setting led to substantial differences in the location and intensity of rainfall, for example, the simulated rainfall accumulations vary from once every 2 to 40 years. By comparing those experiments with good and poor results, we illustrate why the simulated rainfall differ so much in the new perspective of convection evolution. The small differences in near-surface air conditions over cities can lead to huge bifurcation in convection development. Whether the continuous lifting of warm onshore airflows can be reproduced dictates whether a well-organized rainstorm can subsequently form. The dynamical structure of the rainstorm can substantially modulate the microphysical production and transportation of rainwater and thus the maximal hourly rain rates.The simulated rainfall shows high uncertainties in 11 experiments with only minor changes in an urban canopy parameter Small differences in the urban near-surface air conditions lead to huge variations in local convection and subsequent rainstorms The uncertainties in simulating mesoscale and convective-scale processes lead to the uncertainties in predicting extreme rainfall","Li, Zhenghui","Luo, Yali","Chen, Feng",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES,extreme rainfall,simulation uncertainty,convective processes,anthropogenic influences,multiply layer urban canopy model,RECORD-BREAKING RAINFALL,URBAN CANOPY MODEL,HEAVY RAINFALL,LAND-USE,HOURLY PRECIPITATION,EMISSION INVENTORIES,MOIST CONVECTION,SOUTH CHINA,LARGE-EDDY,SENSITIVITY,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 16 2024,Analysis of Uncertainties and Associated Convective Processes in Simulations of Extreme Precipitation Over Cities With a Regional Earth System Model: A Case Study

Using 28 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6)-based monthly surface wind predictions, the multi-model ensemble (MME) approach in this study generates these predictions using random forest (RF) and multiple linear regression (MLR) methods over seven geographical regions in Turkiye with varying topographic complexity between 1980 and 2014, along with an offshore region. Benchmark datasets, station observations, and individual GCM predictions are used to compare the performances of MME predictions. The analysis showed that individual and the simple mean of GCM simulations are highly biased in spatial and temporal wind means. On the other hand, the MMEs formed by using groups of GCMs have significant skill for representing temporal variability in wind speed as well as for producing annual climatology and anomaly range for topographically complex regions.

To combat ecological degradation and promote ecosystem sustainability, China has made substantial investments in ecological restoration in recent decades. Nevertheless, a comprehensive analysis of the effec-tiveness and driving mechanisms of these efforts are still lacking. Therefore, this study aims to bridge this gap by employing national land-use survey data to evaluate the effectiveness and driving mechanisms of China's ecological restoration efforts during 2009-2019, with a specific focus on ecological land preservation, land use structure, and their contribution to ecosystem services. Additionally, the Geodetector model was used to detect potential influencing factors and driving mechanisms of these efforts. The results of this study revealed that: (1) Between 2009 and 2019, a total of 585,492.61 km2 of non-ecological land was successfully transformed into ecological land through various ecological restoration efforts. Most of these areas were previously unused or cultivated land. (2) Forest and grass plantations were the major ecological restoration efforts in China, ac-counting for 47.35% and 41.91% of the total restored ecological land, respectively. Grassland restoration clus-tered northwest of the Hu Line, while forest restoration concentrated mainly to the southeast. Water and wetlands restoration were mainly distributed around China's major rivers, such as the Yangtze River and Yellow River.

Row_331,"The visual landscape plays a pivotal role in urban planning and healthy cities. Recent studies of visual evaluation focus on either objective or subjective approach, while describing the visual character holistically and monitor its evolution remains challenging. This study introduces an embedding-driven clustering approach that integrates both physical and perceptual attributes to infer the spatial structure of the visual environment, and investigates its spatio-temporal evolution. Singapore, a highly urbanised yet green city, is selected as a case study. Firstly, a visual feature matrix is derived from street view imagery (SVI). Then, a graph neural network is constructed based on road connections to encode visual features and spatial dependency leading to a clustering algorithm that is used to discover the underlying characteristics of the visual environment. The implementation characterises streetscapes of the city-state into six types of clusters. Finally, taking advantage of historical SVI, a longitudinal analysis reveals how visual clusters have evolved in the past decade. Among them, one of the clusters represents high-density visual experience, affirming the work as such streetscape dominates the central business district and it is evolving elsewhere, mirroring the expansion of new towns. In turn, another identified cluster, indicating sparse landscapes, decreased, while areas that are considered to be in the most visually pleasant cluster, increased. For the first time, this study demonstrates a novel method to understand the urban visual structure and analyse its spatio-temporal evolution, which could support future planning decision-making and urban landscape betterment.","Liang, Xiucheng","Zhao, Tianhong","Biljecki, Filip",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,40,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,Computer vision,Urban perception,Street-level,Urban pattern,Change detection,GraphSAGE,LANDSCAPE,PERCEPTION,DENSITY,DESIGN,PREFERENCES,AESTHETICS,QUALITIES,PATTERNS,CANYONS,SPACES,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2023,Revealing spatio-temporal evolution of urban visual environments with street view imagery
Row_332,"Snow accumulations, especially if of great intensity, as is the case in northern countries, for example, can be very damaging, especially if they occur in urban environments. The damage provoked by snow is not only related to the weight of the accumulations, causing damage to structures but also to the pollution retained by the structure of the snowflakes. However, snow weight monitoring is a complex task, both because of the placement of the sensors and the specific operating ranges they must have in terms of operating temperature. These complications can be overcome by the design and use of a soft sensor, that is, a sensor capable of making indirect measurements from other parameters related to the measurement under consideration. This paper presents the design and metrological validation of a soft sensor for indirect weight measurement of snow accumulations. The designed soft sensor has been based on Artificial Neural Network and achieved, as a result, a Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) of 114g and a maximum extended uncertainty, evaluated by Monte Carlo simulation, of 300g in a measurement range from 150g to 5200g.","Carratu, M.","Gallo, V.","Liguori, C.","Shallari, I.","Lundgren, J.","O'nils, M.",,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2024 IEEE International Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference (I2MTC),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024,Design and Evaluation of a Soft Sensor for Snow Weight Measurement
Row_333,"The urban RPA (Receiving Pervious Area) -DIA (Disconnected Impervious Area) system is the sub-catchment with a typical land distribution pattern where the connectivity between impervious area and drainage is disconnected by pervious area in the context of Low Impact Development (LID). The rainfall-runoff response of the RPA-DIA system is complex and plays an important role in LID management, which is not yet fully understood. In this study, to systematically learn the rainfall-runoff response of the RPA-DIA system, an indoor rainfall simulation experiment was applied to a laboratory RPA-DIA system, and an integrated surface-subsurface flow model was used to simulate the hydrological processes of actual-scale RPA-DIA systems with consideration of numerous rainfall and underlying surface conditions. Both the laboratory experiment and the numerical simulations show a segmented linear runoff-imperviousness relationship for the RPA-DIA system. A threshold of impervious area exists in the runoff-imperviousness relationship, and when the impervious area is less than the threshold, the surface runoff coefficient is zero, otherwise the surface runoff coefficient increases with impervious area in a generally linear trend. We define the slope of the linear trend as the R -I sensitivity (sensitivity of runoff to imperviousness), which is the key metric to determine the runoff-imperviousness relationship. We further explored how the R -I sensitivity changes between different rainfall and RPA conditions (e.g., different LID facilities and initial soil moistures) and found that both the laboratory experiment and the numerical simulations suggest a very simple equation to express the R -I sensitivity (RISE, Runoff-Imperviosness Sensitivity Equation) in terms of rainfall depth and intensity, including three parameters indicating the specific RPA conditions. Based on the segmented linear relationship and RISE, we have established a framework that vividly presents the rainfall control behavior of a specific RPA under different rainfall events, which can be a simple tool to provide costeffective guidelines for LID facilities adapting to current or future rainfall characters.","Wang, Yao","Zhang, Xiang","Gong, Li","Wang, Weiguang","She, Dunxian","Liu, Jie",,,,,,,,,,,,,0,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Low impact development,Sponge city,Disconnected impervious area,Integrated surface-subsurface flow model,Sensitivity of runoff to imperviousness,LID adaptation,LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT,ENTRAPPED AIR,MODEL,INFILTRATION,CLIMATE,SOILS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 2024,On the relationship between surface runoff and impervious area in the urban RPA (Receiving Pervious Area)-DIA (Disconnected Impervious Area) system: A simple equation expressing the sensitivity of runoff to changes in imperviousness
Row_334,"City scene generation has gained significant attention in autonomous driving, smart city development, and traffic simulation. It helps enhance infrastructure planning and monitoring solutions. Existing methods have employed a two-stage process involving city layout generation, typically using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), or Transformers, followed by neural rendering. These techniques often exhibit limited diversity and noticeable artifacts in the rendered city scenes. The rendered scenes lack variety, resembling the training images, resulting in monotonous styles. Additionally, these methods lack planning capabilities, leading to less realistic generated scenes. In this paper, we introduce CityCraft, an innovative framework designed to enhance both the diversity and quality of urban scene generation. Our approach integrates three key stages: initially, a diffusion transformer (DiT) model is deployed to generate diverse and controllable 2D city layouts. Subsequently, a Large Language Model(LLM) is utilized to strategically make land-use plans within these layouts based on user prompts and language guidelines. Based on the generated layout and city plan, we utilize the asset retrieval module and Blender for precise asset placement and scene construction. Furthermore, we contribute two new datasets to the field: 1)CityCraft-OSM dataset including 2D semantic layouts of urban areas, corresponding satellite images, and detailed annotations. 2) CityCraft-Buildings dataset, featuring thousands of diverse, high-quality 3D building assets.

Row_335,"Environmental vulnerability is an important tool to understand the natural and anthropogenic impacts associated with the susceptibility to environmental damage. This study aims to assess the environmental vulnerability of the Doce River basin in Brazil through Multicriteria Decision Analysis based on Geographic Information Systems (GIS-MCDA). Natural factors (slope, elevation, relief dissection, rainfall, pedology, and geology) and anthropogenic factors (distance from urban centers, roads, mining dams, and land use) were used to determine the environmental vulnerability index (EVI). The EVI was classified into five classes, identifying associated land uses. Vulnerability was verified in water resource management units (UGRHs) and municipalities using hot spot analysis. The study employed the water quality index (WQI) to assess the EVI and global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to evaluate the model input parameters that most influence the basin's environmental vulnerability. The results showed that the regions near the middle Doce River were considered environmentally more vulnerable, especially the UGRHs Guandu, Manhuacu, and Caratinga; and 35.9% of the basin has high and very high vulnerabilities. Hot spot analysis identified regions with low EVI values (cold spot) in the north and northwest, while areas with high values (hot spot) were concentrated mainly in the middle Doce region. Water monitoring stations with the worst WQI values were found in the most environmentally vulnerable areas. The GSA determined that land use and slope were the primary factors influencing the model's response.

Navigating UAVs in complex 3D environments is a challenging task that requires robust and efficient decision-making algorithms. This paper presents a novel approach to UAV navigation in 3D environments using a Curriculum-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach. The proposed method utilizes a deep neural network to model the UAV's decision-making process and to learn a mapping from the state space to the action space. The learning process is guided by a reinforcement signal that reflects the performance of the UAV in terms of reaching its target while avoiding obstacles and with energy efficiency. Simulation results show that the proposed method has a positive trade off when compared to the baseline algorithm. The proposed method was able to perform well in environments with a state space size of 22 millions, allowing the usage in big environments or in maps with high resolution. The results demonstrate the potential of DRL for enabling UAVs to operate effectively in complex environments.","de Carvalho, Kevin Braathen","de Oliveira, Iure Rosa L.","Brandao, Alexandre S.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"2023 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS, ICUAS",Deep Reinforcement Learning,Curriculum Learning,Urban Environments,3D Navigation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023,UAV Navigation in 3D Urban Environments with Curriculum-based Deep Reinforcement Learning
Row_337,"Transportation has become one of the fastest-growing fields for greenhouse gas emissions. It is important to promote the coordinated development of cities and transportation. To deeply understand the emission distribution for urban travel, this study first applies a map matching algorithm to correct the vehicle Global Positioning System (GPS) trajectories on the road network and calculates the travel emissions by the COmputer Programme to calculate Emissions from Road Transport (COPERT) model. Most studies on the impact of built environment on travel emissions only consider the spatially heterogeneity of variables. Although the traditional GTWR can consider the spatio-temporally heterogeneous effects, the spatio-temporal bandwidth is selected at the same scale in the operation process, which limits the relationship analysis among diverse variables. Therefore, this study adopts a unilateral geographically and temporally weighted regression model (UGTWR) and its multiscale extended model (MUGTWR) to estimate the spatio-temporally heterogeneous effects of the built environment on urban travel emissions. In addition, considering the scale effect and zoning effect of the spatial geographical unit selection on the results, we conducted experiments separately on three spatial units: subdistrict scale, Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZs) and grid scale to compare and obtain the most appropriate partitioning schemes. The results show that, the fitting effects of UGTWR and MUGTWR are better than that of GTWR, indicating that considering flexible bandwidth selection can effectively improve the accuracy of simulation. Moreover, the temporal and spatial bandwidth values of each independent variable calculated by MUGTWR reflect the heterogeneous characteristics in space and time of different built environment factors, which can provide scientific suggestions for formulating urban planning. The research results can provide planning strategies for optimizing the allocation of local transportation resources and guiding low-carbon travel behaviors.","Zhao, Chuyun","Tang, Jinjun","Zeng, Yu","Li, Zhitao","Gao, Fan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,9,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Map-matching algorithm,COPERT,Multiscale GTWR,Built environment,Urban travel emissions,AREAL UNIT PROBLEM,CO2 EMISSIONS,TRANSPORT EMISSIONS,WEIGHTED REGRESSION,ENERGY-CONSUMPTION,TRAFFIC EMISSIONS,CARBON EMISSIONS,FUEL CONSUMPTION,LAND-USE,VEHICLE,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2023,Understanding the spatio-temporally heterogeneous effects of built environment on urban travel emissions
Row_338,"Past land-use reconstructions are a key tool for studying long-term human ecodynamics and addressing pressing questions about the origins and evolutionary dynamics of the Anthropocene. In particular, agricultural landcover reconstructions are vital for understanding long-term human-environment dynamics. Most past agricultural land-use models, however, rely heavily on modelling assumptions, make limited use of known archaeological site locations to constrain or inform their estimates and tend to be limited to general estimates of percentages of plant types within catchments around pollen trapping lakes. The lack of information outside catchment areas and low spatial resolution even within catchments constrain the utility of these models. To address this problem, we propose a new approach that combines archaeological predictive modelling with pollen-based agricultural landcover reconstructions to produce more accurate, spatially explicit past landcover estimates. Here, we present the results of a case study deploying the new approach to produce improved past landcover maps for a region in the Western Taurus Mountains, southwestern Turkey. The study area surrounds Sagalassos, an antique urban centre with a regional settlement history encompassing nine millennia. We produced five archaeological predictive models for the study region using the 'Locally Adaptive Models of Archaeological Potential' (LAMAP) method spanning the Hellenistic through Late Ottoman period. We then combined those predictive surfaces with 'Regional Estimates of VEgetation Abundance from Large Sites' (REVEALS) pollen landcover reconstructions for the same periods based on pollen from sediment cores extracted from three catchments within the study area. Lastly, we compared the resulting hybrid landcover models to the archaeological record using data not used to make the predictions. We found that the hybrid landcover model aligned very well with the known extents of agricultural land-use from the study area. These results indicate that the proposed approach is a viable way to combine pollen-based landcover models with archaeological data and produce more accurate, empirically-based landcover reconstructions reflecting real human activity in the past.","Willett, Patrick T.","Carleton, W.

Based on MODIS land cover data (MCD12Q1), statistical parameters such as land cover dynamic degree, transition probability, and transition matrix were employed to analyse the spatiotemporal characteristics of global land cover changes from 2001 to 2020. The results indicated that land cover exhibits a latitudinal distribution in mid-latitude regions and a longitudinal distribution in high and low-latitude regions. During the study period, the areas of evergreen needleleaf forests, deciduous needleleaf forests, deciduous broadleaf forests, closed shrublands, and permanent wetlands exhibited fluctuating changes. Evergreen broadleaf forests and barren lands have decreased annually, whereas mixed forests, woody savannas, grasslands, urban and built-up areas, and cropland/natural vegetation mosaics have increased annually. In terms of the dynamic degree, the most significant changes occurred in deciduous broadleaf forests, closed shrublands, permanent wetlands, and cropland/natural vegetation mosaics. Additionally, there were significant variations in the types and regions of land cover changes and transitions. Evergreen needleleaf forests transitioned into grassland types, and the conversion between grassland types was the main transition from mid- to high- latitude regions. In tropical areas, evergreen broadleaf forests, open shrublands, and croplands have shifted towards grassland types as primary transitions. These findings provide significant implications for the in-depth exploration of land-atmosphere interactions, climate change, and numerical models.","Jing, Qiaoqiao","He, Jianjun","Li, Yarong","Yang, Xianyu","Peng, Yue","Wang, Hong","Yu, Fei","Wu, Jie","Gong, Sunling","Che, Huizheng","Zhang, Xiaoye",,,,,,,,10,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,Land cover changes,Spatial-temporal distributions,Regional variations,MODIS,CLIMATE-CHANGE,PROJECTIONS,CHINA,MODIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 15 2024,Analysis of the spatiotemporal changes in global land cover from 2001 to 2020

In this study, we proposed a new landuse/landcover (LULC) scheme for these models by combining the local climate zones (LCZs) from World Urban Database Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) and building category (BC) map. Apart from evaluating against the conventional LULC of Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) and WUDAPT, the impact of urban canopy parameters and BC on the simulated meteorological conditions and AC load during the 2016 heatwave in Hong Kong was examined by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model.

It captured the heterogeneous, intra-urban T2 and turbulence kinetic energy (TKE). Further sub-classifying the BC in LCZs led to WUDAPT/BC which performed even better and significantly improved WRF output.

Row_341,"The rapid urbanization has accelerated the destruction of regional ecosystems, triggering ecological risks and threatening sustainable development. Landscape ecological risk (LER) evaluation is an effective tool to mitigate such negative impacts. However, the existing evaluation systems exhibit certain subjectivity. Therefore, an improved LER evaluation method was proposed, which incorporates ecosystem services (ESs) to characterize landscape vulnerability. The method was validated using the Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration (PRDUA) as the study area. The results showed that the optimal grain size and extent for landscape pattern analysis in the PRDUA were determined to be 150 m and 6km x 6 km, respectively. The comparison results with the traditional LER evaluation method demonstrated the improved method's superior rationality and reliability. The hotspot analysis based on the Getis-Ord Gi* method revealed that the hotspots of LER were mainly concentrated in the densely populated areas of the south-central region of the PRDUA. The coupling coordination degree (CCD) between LERs and ESs showed four different levels of development in both temporal and spatial dimensions, generally dominated by moderately balanced development and lagging ESs, reflecting the unbalanced ecological environment and socio-economic development of the PRDUA. It is recommended that the ecosystems in the PRDUA be managed and protected separately according to the delineated Ecological Protection Area (EPA), Urban Built-up Area (UBA), and Urban Ecological Boundary Area (UEBA).

Row_342,"Mapping land cover in highly heterogeneous landscapes is challenging, and classifications have inherent limitations where the spatial resolution of remotely sensed data exceeds the size of small objects. For example, classifications based on 30-m Landsat data do not capture urban or other heterogeneous environments well. This limitation may be overcome by quantifying the subpixel fractions of different land cover types. However, the selection process and transferability of models designed for subpixel land cover mapping across biomes is yet challenging. We asked to what extent (a) locally trained models can be used for sub-pixel land cover fraction estimates in other biomes, and (b) training data from different regions can be combined into spatially generalized models to quantify fractions across global biomes. We applied machine learning regression-based fraction mapping to quantify land cover fractions of 18 regions in five biomes using Landsat data from 2022. We used spectral -temporal metrics to incorporate intra-annual temporal information and compared the performance of local, spatially transferred, and spatially generalized models. Local models performed best when applied to their respective sites (average mean absolute error, MAE, 9-18%), and also well when transferred to other sites within the same biome, but not consistently so for out -of -biome sites. However, spatially generalized models that combined input data from many sites worked very well when analyzing sites in many different biomes, and their MAE values were only slightly higher than those of the respective local models. A weighted training data selection approach, preferring training data with a lower spectral distance to the image data to be predicted, further enhanced the performance of generalized models. Our results suggest that spatially generalized regression-based fraction models can support multi-class sub-pixel fraction estimates based on mediumresolution satellite images globally. Such products would have great value for environmental monitoring in heterogeneous environments and where land cover varies along spatial or temporal gradients.","Schug, Franz","Pfoch, Kira A.","Pham, Vu -Dong","van der Linden, Sebastian","Okujeni, Akpona","Frantz, David","Radeloff, Volker C.",,,,,,,,,,,,0,REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT,Model transfer,Synthetic training data,Weighted training data,Neural network regression,MIXTURE ANALYSIS,URBAN-DEVELOPMENT,SOIL MODEL,VEGETATION,TIME,ENVIRONMENTS,COMPOSITES,FRAMEWORK,ABUNDANCE,DYNAMICS,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 1 2024,"Land cover fraction mapping across global biomes with Landsat data, spatially generalized regression models and spectral-temporal metrics"
Row_343,"Assessing the impacts of climate change and land-use change is of critical importance, particularly for urbanized catch-ments. In this study, a novel framework was used to examine and quantify these impacts on the runoff in six catch-ments in Southeast Queensland, Australia. For each catchment, temporal variations in impervious areas were derived from six satellite images using a sub-pixel classification technique and incorporated into the SIMHYD hydro-logical model. This model was satisfactorily calibrated and validated with daily runoff observations (0.63 <= Nash- Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient <= 0.94, percent bias <= +/- 18 %) and was used to produce baseline runoff for 1986-2005 in these six catchments. The projected population increase was used to predict future imperviousness based on the linear relationship between the two. The projected rainfall and evapotranspiration were derived from the ensemble means of the eight general circulation models. Catchment runoff was projected under two climate change scenarios (RCP4.5 and 8.5), three urbanization scenarios (low, medium, and high), and six combined scenarios for two future periods (2026-2045 and 2046-2065). Comparing with the baseline, it was found that (1) climate change alone would lead to a -3.8 % to -17.6 % reduction in runoff among the six catchments, for all scenarios and both future periods; (2) a 11.8 % to 78 % increase in runoff was projected under the three urbanization scenarios, and (3) a de-crease in runoff due to climate change would moderate the increase in runoff caused by urbanization. For example, the combined effect would be a 54 % increase in runoff, with a -17.2 % decrease due to climate change and 78 % increase due to urbanization. Overall, runoff in the six catchments may be significantly affected by urban expansion. From this study, decision makers could gain a better understanding of the relative importance of the effects of climate and land-use change, which can be applied when developing future long-term water management plans at the catch-ment scale.","Ramezani, Mohammad Reza","Helfer, Fernanda","Yu, Bofu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,Runoff,Urbanization,Climate change,LandSat images,Land-useclassification,LAND-USE CHANGES,IMPERVIOUS SURFACE,FUTURE CLIMATE,RIVER-BASIN,URBAN-GROWTH,SIMULATION,STREAMFLOW,MODEL,WATER,PROJECTIONS,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 25 2023,"Individual and combined impacts of urbanization and climate change on catchment runoff in Southeast Queensland, Australia"

LULC transformation may have negative consequences on soil erosion, disrupting the sustainability of water resources, and maintaining hydrological balance. Therefore, this study evaluates the potential impact of LULC changes in past and future scenarios on the hydrological components of the Chalus basin, Northern Iran. In this case, the LULC maps of 1987, 2001, and 2021 were classified by the random forest algorithm, and 2049's LULC was predicted using the CA-Markov model. The accuracy assessment of all the years was investigated utilizing confusion matrices, the kappa coefficients, and overall accuracies. Then, different LULC scenarios were applied to the calibrated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to analyze the monthly and annual rates of evapotranspiration, surface runoff, lateral flow, and water yield. The result revealed that each land use scenario significantly impacts hydrological components. We found that with the reduction of forest and rangeland by expanding built-up and cultivated land, the average annual surface runoff, and water yield will increase by approximately +7.6%, and +3.3%, respectively, until 2049. The result was proved by a high negative correlation between built-up, cultivated land, forest, and rangeland. However, the average annual rate of lateral flow and evapotranspiration will decrease by roughly -3.2% and -1.09% up to 2049 in the middle and downstream of the study area. The declining trend of evapotranspiration rates through the wet and dry seasons in the past and future LULC indicates that forest land produces more evapotranspiration than agricultural land in this area. This agreement was confirmed by the maximum correlation coefficient of 1.00. This research finding could assist urban planners and decision-makers in re-examining and organizing new strategies for sustainable development and water resource management.","Gholami, Farinaz","Sedighifar, Zahra","Ghaforpur, Parastoo","Li, Yue","Zhang, Junlong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 30 2023,"Spatial-temporal analysis of various land use classifications and their long-term alteration's impact on hydrological components: using remote sensing, SAGA-GIS, and ARCSWAT model"

These dynamics are affected by a variety of variables, spanning economic, structural, political and environmental. With respect to this latter aspect, much research has explored the relationship between the development of urban green areas, the increase of price and the formation of gentrification. Within this context, the present work explores housing mobility and gentrification dynamics proposing a mixed-method approach that combines a spatially explicit agent-based model (ABM), a Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and a Hedonic Price (HP). The case study of the transformation project of Victoria Park in Brisbane (Australia) is used to verify the applicability of this integrated approach. In the methodological framework proposed, the ABM simulates the housing mobility of the residents through an individual decision-making process, where the likelihood of mobility is based on various empirical endogenous factors (i.e., household socio-economic characteristics) and exogenous ones (i.e., market variation). The MCDA supports the identification of the relative importance of these factors using a panel of local experts and stakeholders. The Spatial HP explores the impact of urban parks on real estate prices. The current study found the abilities of MCDA and HP to reduce the assumptions of ABM by generating quali-quantitative information of citizens' behaviors and estimating price increase. Moreover, the model highlights the importance of considering both supply and demand sides when analyzing gentrification.

The whole network was then transferred to WMS 11.0 where the outlets were denoted and the sub-catchments were delineated and a 1D schematic map was created. Afterward, the map was transferred to EPA SWMM 5.1, and data like invert elevation, % slope, % impervious, and many more were inserted into the model. After the model simulation, runoff coefficients of every sub-catchments were obtained. In around 42 sub-catchments, the peak runoff was greater than or equal to 0.1 m3/s. Runoff coefficients for every sub-catchments were simulated from the model. These values are calibrated to match the estimated values from the land use map of the study area (generated from satellite images). The RMSE value for this comparison was 0.0048. The total runoff volume from the model simulation is used to design the minimum cross-section of every conduit which is the prime objective of this study. These conduit areas ranged between 0.00125m2 to 6.8725m2. Apart from these, flood hazard maps, flood risk maps, and % slope maps were also created using ArcGIS for supporting different causes.

Row_348,"As one of China's national urban agglomerations, the middle reaches of the Yangtze River urban agglomeration (MRYRA) has suffered from serious PM2.5 pollution for a considerable period. Using deep learning methods to fit the quantitative relationship between aerosol optical depth (AOD) and PM2.5 (AOD-PM2.5) has received extensive attention. In this study, based on the correlation between AOD and PM2.5 data, a new network model BiCNN is proposed by using the satellite-ground synergy method, aiming to obtain the spatial distribution of PM2.5 concentration in the MRYRA. Data from MRYRA 2019 is used for model training and testing. The results show that BiCNN exhibits the best estimation on the annual scale, with a fit coefficient R2 of 0.836 and the smallest error, RMSE of 6.746 and MAPE of 12.497 compared to the benchmark model. The model effectively improves the relationship between AOD-PM2.5. The spatial distribution of PM2.5 in the MRYRA from 2019 to 2022 by applying the BiCNN model inversion shows that the PM2.5 concentration is higher in 2020, but the overall air quality improves year by year. Seasonal evaluation results show that BiCNN has a significant advantage in PM2.5 estimation in autumn, with R2 reaching 0.883. The spatial distribution of PM2.5 shows a spatial pattern of higher in spring and winter, lower in summer and autumn, and transition in autumn. The BiCNN model integrates the advantages of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (BiLSTM), makes full use of historical and future data, and can effectively capture the temporal and spatial characteristics between cofactors and PM2.5 data. It has achieved ideal results in the PM2.5 estimation of the MRYRA and provides an effective scientific method for air pollution control in urban agglomerations.","Wu, Shuaiwen","Li, Hengkai","Zhou, Yanbing","He, Yonglan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY,MRYRA,PM2.5,AOD,Satellite,BiCNN,AEROSOL OPTICAL DEPTH,AIR-POLLUTION,NEURAL-NETWORK,LAND-COVER,MACHINE,HEALTH,GROWTH,PM10,,,,,,,,,,,,,APR 2024,PM2.5 estimation and analysis of BiCNN model considering spatiotemporal characteristics: a case study of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River urban agglomeration

However, the ecosystems carbon stock dynamic, carbon sequestration potential and main driving factors in the economically developed regions of China, Jiangsu Province in recent 40 years are still unclear. Existential quantification scale and interactive human-land coupling relationship pose a great challenge to identify the carbon dynamics pattern in economically developed regions in China. In this study, we used scenarios simulation and main control factor analysis method to identify the spatiotemporal pattern of carbon dynamics in the developed Jiangsu region from 1979 to 2018, and defined and evaluated the sensitivity of different ecosystems to different environmental factors. Furthermore, we separated and quantified the individual and interactive response characteristics of carbon stocks to different environmental factors, and the results showed that Jiangsu has experienced rapid climate change (warming rate +0.5 degrees C/10a), and warming is a key climate factor leading to a decrease in soil organic carbon (SOC), and decreased by -30.7 g C/m(2) during the study period is greater than the promotion effect of precipitation (18.7 g C/m(2)).Vegetation carbon (VEGC) has no significant response to temperature and precipitation. The pattern of carbon dynamic shows significant spatial heterogeneity. On the whole, there is a trend of increasing carbon storage in coastal areas and decreasing carbon storage in urban agglomeration in southern Jiangsu. The factor analysis results indicate that the CO2 enrichment effect promotes the increase of carbon storage in different carbon reservoirs; The impact of climate change on different carbon pools mainly manifests as negative effects; The interactive effect is manifested as a positive effect, and the sensitivity of carbon stocks to the positive CO2 fertilization effect is greater than that to climate change.

The vertical structure comprising ""tree + shrub + soil"" is a common feature in urban green spaces. The Penman-Monteith and Shuttleworth-Wallace models estimate the evapotranspiration (ET) from trees and soil only, but they do not account for the contribution of shrubs, thereby leading to underestimation of the ecosystem ET. We developed a three-layer model of the vertical structure comprising ""tree + shrub + soil"" in urban green spaces and its impacts on ecosystem ET. The three-layer model was validated based on data measurements, showing that the root mean square errors of latent heat flux for tree, shrub, and soil were 31.0 W & sdot;m-2, 21.3 W & sdot;m-2, and 19.1 W & sdot;m-2, respectively. The uncertainty of parameters can significantly affect the model's performance when estimating ET and its components. Sensitivity analysis showed that meteorological parameters, bulk stomatal resistance, and soil surface resistance played important roles in ET estimation using the threelayer model, and these sensitivity coefficients were also influenced by the meteorological conditions and vegetation canopy structure. The three-layer model enhances our understanding of ET in urban green spaces, aiding in their management and planning.","Li, Qiong","Li, Qi","Mi, Jiayi","Wu, Haotian",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING,Bosch,Evapotranspiration model,Evapotranspiration partition,Sensitivity analysis,Urban green spaces,SURFACE-ENERGY FLUXES,SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS,2-SOURCE MODEL,WATER-BALANCE,HEAT EXTREMES,HOT WEATHER,TRANSPIRATION,EVAPORATION,CANOPY,PARAMETERIZATION,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 2024,A three-layer evapotranspiration model considering the vertical structure of urban green spaces

However, in low-altitude SAR 3-D imaging of urban scenes, multipath effect is significant. In past studies, multipath signals have been mostly considered as a hindrance in interpretation, but they provide important clues for imaging hidden targets in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) regions. Based on this idea, this article studies the multipath exploitation in low-altitude UAV-borne array-InSAR 3-D imaging and realizes accurate imaging of NLOS targets. An improved 3-D imaging model suitable for low-altitude cases is introduced to achieve preliminary 3-D imaging. Subsequently, key planes are extracted from the original results and the 3-D multipath reachable area is analyzed. After obtaining the multipath mechanism of the NLOS targets, they can eventually be accurately relocated and imaged. Both the simulation and real-data experiments show that the proposed method can effectively 3-D imaging and relocate NLOS targets in urban canyons, with errors typically below 0.5 m. The imageable range in the direction of the ground range can be expanded by 41.62%, and the imageable 3-D area can be expanded by 76.57%, which realizes the NLOS information acquisition.","Lin, Yuqing","Qiu, Xiaolan","Luo, Yitong","Ding, Chibiao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING,Imaging,Three-dimensional displays,Radar imaging,Solid modeling,Synthetic aperture radar,Buildings,Urban areas,Array interferometric SAR (array-InSAR) 3-D imaging,multipath exploitation,non-line-of-sight (NLOS),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024,Multipath Exploitation: Non-Line-of-Sight Target Relocation in Array-InSAR 3-D Imaging
Row_353,"land use change had a considerable impact on the regional water cycle throughout the past century, leading to an influence on water security. Bluewater (BW) and Greenwater (GW) concepts have found broad application in evaluating the water accessibility of both socioeconomic and ecological systems. However, regarding the interactions between BW and GW systems and their coupled risk under land use change, there has been limited research in this area. This study aims to address this gap by developing an integrated Hydrology and Water Security Modeling Framework (HWSMF) that combines a hydrological model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool), a copula-coupled risk model, and a water security assessment model to assess the impact of land use change on regional water security. As an example, the methodology was utilized in the East River basin (ERB) located in China's Pearl River Delta. Results showed that the sensitivity of GW to forest land change was significant. In general, land use change had a notable impact on the GW coefficient at a rate of more than 4% of change and in certain areas, it was over 8%. Due to land use change the freshwater availability per individual in each city of this basin decreased. When the probability of coupled risk is defined, the BW required is greater than the GW required in this basin. Land use change can lead to fluctuations in the coupled risk of the regional BluewaterGreenwater nexus system (BGN), which implies that appropriate land use management could be promising for regional water system risk mitigation. The results of this study will be valuable for policymakers and managers of watersheds in their endeavors to manage water resources sustainably amidst evolving land use patterns.","Li, Yutong","Cai, Yanpeng","Chen, Xiaohong","Xu, Zhihao","Fu, Qiang",,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Land use,Water security,Water footprints,Copula,Hydrological model,WATER-RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,RIVER-BASINS,SECURITY,UNCERTAINTY,CLIMATE,SCARCITY,IMPACTS,FLOW,CALIBRATION,HYDROLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2023,An integrated modeling approach for coupled risk management of regional Blue- and Greenwater under changing land-use patterns
Row_354,"Urbanization is inevitably accompanied by drastic changes in regional land use and therefore presents an evident influence on ecosystems. Habitat quality (HQ) reflects the ability of a habitat to provide suitable conditions for the survival of an individual or population, and clarifying the interrelationships between urbanization level (UL) and HQ provides insights into sustainable urbanzation and ecosystems conservation. Much attention has focused on how urbanization related to HQ at multi-scales, but few studies have analyzed the interactive coercive relationships between UL and HQ on the global county level. To address this gap, we adopted the bivariate spatial autocorrelation and coupling coordination degree (CCD) model to determine their interactive coercive relationships at the county level globally. Results showed that the global average UL was 0.0807, 0.0838, and 0.0857 in 2000, 2010, and 2020, respectively, with a continuously increasing trend. The global average HQ was 0.6186, 0.6133, and 0.6111 for 2000, 2010, and 2020, reflecting opposite declining trends. The Moran's I of population urbanization and HQ in 2000, 2010, and 2020 globally remained negative but showed an increasing trend, with values of -0.189, -0.228, and -0.254, respectively, while those of economic urbanization and HQ and land urbanization and HQ also remained negative and exhibited a similar increasing trend. The spatial autocorrelations for UL and HQ in different dimensions indicated that deserts and plateaus functioned as catchment areas with low UL and HQ. The CCD between UL and HQ in each county globally ranged from 0 to 0.70, while CCD between land urbanization and HQ was the most optimal at 0-0.90. The CCD between population urbanization and HQ was similar to that of economic urbanization in terms of spatial distribution. Nevertheless, the CCD of land urbanization in HQ exhibited the greatest degree of coordination among the three urbanization dimensions during the study period. These findings provided important support for sustainable urbanization and ecosystem protection globally.","Li, Weisong","Wu, Jiahui","Yuan, Yanghaoyue","Duan, Binqiao","Pan, Sipei","Chen, Wanxu","Chen, Yan",,,,,,,,,,,,0,LAND,urbanization,habitat quality,bivariate spatial autocorrelation,coupling coordination model,global scale,URBAN EXPANSION,DRIVING FORCES,AREA EXPANSION,COMPACT CITY,LAND-USE,BIODIVERSITY,AGGLOMERATION,SIMULATION,PATTERNS,DENSITY,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2024,Global Urbanization and Habitat Quality: Interactive Coercive Relationships

This study aims to assess the soil susceptibility of GLs for past, present, and future scenarios, considering the projected anthropogenic effect from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Version 6 (CMIP6). Therefore, the soil loss estimations were made for all the GLs in the southern region of Santa Catarina state in Brazil using the Revised Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). Our results showed average soil loss decreasing from 1985 to 2020. There was an increase in GLs in the null class (soil loss = 0 t/ha/year), mainly caused by urban growth. A decrease occurred in the low (0 t/ha/year < soil loss =10 t/ha/year), very severe (soil loss >200 t/ha/year), severe (50 t/ha/year < soil loss =200 t/ha/year), and moderate classes (10 t/ha/year < soil loss =50 t/ha/year). In addition, most future scenarios projected an increase in soil loss susceptibility, which also increased the GLs' susceptibility to soil loss from 2020 to 2100, albeit with lower values than the historical series. The soil loss remained stable in ssp126, slightly increased in ssp245 and ssp370, and increased in ssp585. The future scenarios only take into account changes in rainfall. Thus, the land cover change forecast would also be necessary for better analysis for future studies. Therefore, climate simulations can be used to understand the effects of climate change on soil erosion to support decision-making regarding GLs maintenance and the construction of new ones.","da Silveira, Leonard Niero","Nascimento, Victor Fernandez","Casagrande, Fernanda","de Souza, Sergio Florencio","Ometto, Jean Pierre Henry Balbaud",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES,Soil erodibility,Rainfall erosivity,Land use classes,Rainfall,CMIP,Climate scenarios,EROSION,PREDICTION,RUSLE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2023,Assessment of soil loss susceptibility in geodetic landmarks for the past and future climate change scenarios

To solve this problem, this paper introduces a new method for recognition and classification based on deep learning networks.

On this basis, the multiple label conditional random field (MLCRF) algorithm can be applied for global optimization, effectively solving the misclassification problem caused by similar features of vegetation. This method not only improves classification accuracy but also is suitable for large-scale image classification tasks in complex scenes.

In this study, we propose an innovative approach by integrating artificial neural networks (ANN) and cellular automata Markov chain (CA-MA) models to predict future land use and assess the associated forest fragmentation using landscape ecology metrics in the Jamari River Basin. The analysis reveals a significant increase in fragmentation between 1985 and 2018, as evidenced by a rise in the number of fragments from 7162 to 28,170.

Further, accurate quantification of evapotranspiration-shading cooling remains challenging due to heterogeneity of urban landscapes, which limits understanding of its high-resolution spatiotemporal patterns. Here, we integrate high-precision remote sensing data and the Soil-Canopy-Observations of Photosynthesis and Energy Fluxes (SCOPE) model to propose an optimized quantitative approach. The approach was used to investigate changes in evapotranspiration-shade cooling during extreme heat.Taking Shanghai metropolitan as case, the results show: (1) The cooling capacity of urban vegetation in nighttime (18:00-6:00) is enhanced during extreme heat, which is attributed to accumulated effect of shading and enhanced evapotranspiration due to elevated vapor-pressure deficit. (2) In densely built-up areas with limited vegetation, there is a significant lack of thermal regulation, especially in the early morning (7:00) and late evening (17:00), thus exacerbating thermal stress. (3) At midday (11:00-13:00) there was a slight decrease in evaporative cooling, probably caused by the behaviour of the stomatal closure at high temperatures. Concurrently, high radiation causes the shading effect of vegetation to become more prominent, amplifying the cooling contrast between areas with dense and sparse vegetation cover. Moreover, the study also highlights that grassland with >50% cover can provide cooling effects similar to that of forest land. Overall, our study not only enhances the understanding of urban vegetation's cooling effects but also underscores the importance of strategic urban vegetation planning in mitigating urban heat, particularly under the escalating frequency and intensity of heat waves.","Yu, Zhaowu","Chen, Jiaqi","Chen, Jike","Zhan, Wenfeng","Wang, Chenghao","Ma, Wenjuan","Yao, Xihan","Zhou, Siqi","Zhu, Kai","Sun, Ranhao",,,,,,,,,29,REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT,Urban vegetation,Evapotranspiration effect,Shading cooling,SCOPE model,Extreme heat,TEMPERATURE,TRANSPIRATION,MITIGATION,TREES,TECHNOLOGIES,ISLANDS,CLIMATE,CITIES,WAVES,SIZE,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 1 2024,Enhanced observations from an optimized soil-canopy-photosynthesis and energy flux model revealed evapotranspiration-shading cooling dynamics of urban vegetation during extreme heat

Validated by measured data, this framework is adopted to simulate the dynamic meteorology during the heatwave in the Xiongan New Area in Hebei Province, China. Results reveal that the high-density built-up area(HDA) exhibits spatial patterns of higher temperatures, poorer ventilation, more arid, and more severe heat stress than near-river and low-density areas. Moreover, HDA tends to convert more radiation energy into ground heat storage(QS) Q S ) and sensible heat flux(QH) Q H ) during daytime, and QS S is subsequently released into QH H at night, thus deteriorating the nighttime thermal environment. Whereas, the river converts more radiation energy into Q S , with a portion transformed into latent heat flux, which benefits summer cooling.

Row_364,"Extracting mask information of buildings and water areas from high resolution remote sensing images is beneficial to monitoring and management of urban development. However, due to different times, different geographical locations and different remote sensing acquisition angles, water areas and buildings will feed back different spectral information. Existing semantic segmentation methods do not pay enough attention to channel information, and the feature information extracted by downsampling is relatively abstract, which is easy to cause the loss of some details in high-resolution images under complex scenes, leading to the misjudgement of buildings and waters. To solve the existing problems, feature enhancement network (FENet) for high-resolution remote sensing image segmentation of buildings and water areas is proposed. By paying more attention to the characteristic information of the passage, the probability of misjudgement of buildings and waters can be reduced and their edge contour information can be enhanced. The self-attention feature module proposed in this paper encodes the context information and transmits it to the local features, and establishes the relationship between channels through the channel feature enhancement module to reduce the loss of channel feature information. The feature fusion module fuses feature information of different scales in space and outputs more detailed prediction images. Comparative experiments show that this model is superior to the existing classical semantic segmentation model. Compared with the existing models, the proposed method can achieve 2% improvement than PSPNet on the indicator MIoU, and the final MIoU reaches 82.85% for land cover dataset.

Our objective is to present a methodology to develop buildup and washoff parameters for densely populated urban areas, such as the coastal metropolitan area of Los Angeles, California. An assessment is also made to test how these model parameters perform when applied to another urbanized watershed with similar rainfall and climate patterns (i.e., the San Diego River Watershed in California). Using extensive litter collection data from small drainages (approximately 572 locations, each draining 0.05-8.5 ha), we estimate buildup and washoff model parameters. These parameters are used to simulate the buildup of litter and subsequent washoff (load) of litter in our selected watersheds. Simulated results are validated against observed data from different years in all three watersheds. To date, no study has used litter washoff data to develop these parameters for stormwater models and applied them on a regional scale. We compared linear and nonlinear power functions of litter buildup during interstorm periods. Although there were limited data to develop washoff parameters, an exponential washoff function was used and calibrated to the observed washoff. Generally, storm events with the greatest antecedent dry days had the largest litter loading. Buildup rates varied among land uses, and key calibration parameters included the maximum buildup, buildup rate constant, washoff exponent, and washoff coefficient. A parameter sensitivity analysis was conducted to reveal the washoff exponent as the most sensitive parameter. Annual litter loading estimates were 4.60 kg/ha for the Ballona Creek and 11.50 kg/ha for the Los Angeles River. Litter loading estimates for Ballona Creek were validated and calibrated to align with observed data from the Ballona Creek Trash Interceptor, resulting in an annual washoff load of 2.1 kg/ha. The estimated annual litter loading for the Lower San Diego River was 2.15 kg/ha falling between the mean (0.77 kg/ha) and the maximum (3.56 kg/ha) observed values. When applying model parameters from one watershed to another, models require extensive calibration and validation data, as extrapolating data between watersheds can introduce errors.This research can inform stormwater modelers about the process for developing parameters to estimate water quality in numerical modeling software. We demonstrate how data from field sampling can be directly used to develop model parameters. Results show that with proper validation data, stormwater models can accurately simulate annual litter loads in modeled watersheds. Future studies can test model parameters in other urbanized watersheds to validate the potential for standardized buildup values. Field studies can be done in conjunction with the results from this survey to investigate and further validate litter loads mobilized by stormwater. This study highlights the need for long-term monitoring to improve and update models in the future. Although there is a risk of inaccurate results when extrapolating model parameters from one watershed to another, this research indicates the potential for developing buildup and washoff parameters that can be used as a starting point for parameter selection across urban watersheds.","Bagheri, Kian","Davani, Hassan","Biggs, Trent","McMillan, Hilary",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 1 2024,Hydrodynamic Simulations for Trash Loading in Southern California's Dense Urbanized Watersheds
Row_366,"Building urban ecological corridors (UECs) and enhancing their functional connectivity are of great significance for biodiversity conservation and the enhancement of ecosystem services in urbanised areas. However, the key spatial structural indicators that affect the functional connectivity of UECs are unclear, resulting in ineffective ecological corridor optimisation measures. Therefore, this study attempted to reveal the quantitative relationship between the spatial structure and functional connectivity of UECs, using Minhang District, Shanghai, as a representative area. It analysed the type, morphological structure, area, habitat quality, and spatial location of the ecological space, and applied the results to the selection of ecological source patches and construction of resistance surfaces. Considering the species types, this study identified the spatial boundaries of UECs with different cost-weighted distance widths based on least-cost paths to optimise the UEC identification method. It used effective conductance to measure the functional connectivity of UECs and regression modelling to identify the spatial structural factors that contributed to their variation. The results showed that three spatial indicators affected the functional connectivity of UECs: the cost-weighted distance of the least-cost path (LCD), average spatial width (SW), and shape index; of which the LCD was the most critical and negatively-correlated indicator. The functional connectivity of UECs could be enhanced by increasing the SW within a certain width range, but the enhancement rate was inconsistent, and most corridors had transition points. This study screened nine key component types that affected the functional connectivity of UECs, of which the percentage of woodland area was the most critical and positively-correlated indicator. This study provides insights for adjusting the spatial structure and setting appropriate SWs of UECs to effectively improve their functional connectivity, which will help identify specific and actionable optimisation strategies for UECs.","Zhang, Rui","Zhang, Qingping","Zhang, Lang","Zhong, Qicheng",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING,Biodiversity,Circuit theory,Efficient construction,Functional connectivity,Spatial structure,Urban ecological corridors,LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY,HABITAT AVAILABILITY,ECOSYSTEM SERVICES,CIRCUIT-THEORY,CLIMATE-CHANGE,MODEL,INDEXES,REGION,GRAPH,IDENTIFICATION,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2023,Impact of spatial structure on the functional connectivity of urban ecological corridors based on quantitative analysis
Row_367,"Urban green spaces (UGS) significantly influence the distribution of surface heat and play a crucial role in regulating surface temperature. However, the quantitative relationship between UGS and surface temperature remains unclear, necessitating further research. This study aims to predict surface temperature based on green space information from GaoFen-2 satellite data. To achieve this, GaoFen-2 data were utilized to obtain spatial distribution and vegetation growth status in Urumqi, Xinjiang. Three machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT) were constructed to predict surface temperature. Results indicated that UGS information extracted from GaoFen-2 data using the UNet semantic segmentation model successfully predicted surface temperature. Among the three machine learning models, GBRT exhibited the highest predictive accuracy with an R2adj of 0.81, RMSE of 0.44, and RPD of 2.29, followed by RF (R2adj of 0.80, RMSE of 0.45, and RPD of 2.22), and SVM (R2adjof 0.79, RMSE of 0.47, and RPD of 2.15), In addition, a variable importance assessment reduced the original 44 variables to 28, maintaining predictive accuracy with the GBRT model achieving an R2adj of 0.81, RMSE of 0.43, and RPD of 2.3.

Row_368,"Agricultural land plays a crucial role in a country's economy, serving as the foundation for food production and contributing significantly to various aspects of the country's development. This study employs remote sensing techniques and geographic information systems to observe and analyze land use and land cover (LULC) changes, especially in agricultural land in Ben Tre province within the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, spanning from 1997 to 2021. The supervised classification of multispectral Landsat satellite images for the years 1997, 2009, and 2021 was conducted using the maximum likelihood classification algorithm in ArcGIS 10.8 software. The kappa coefficient was also utilized to assess classification accuracy, yielding values of 0.905, 0.896, and 0.916 for the years 1997, 2009, and 2021, respectively. In the period 1997-2009, the agricultural land area decreased by 125.71 km2 primarily due to the urbanization process aimed at meeting the housing demands of the population. During this period, climate change, including droughts, floods, and saltwater intrusion, also affected the water sources serving agriculture. Meanwhile, in the period 2009-2021, the agricultural land area has increased by 212.87 km2. This was influenced by adjustments in policies, initiatives, and advancements in agricultural technology, as well as an increasing awareness of the importance of agriculture in meeting national food security needs. Moreover, the study utilized the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Normalized Difference Built-Up Index (NDBI), and the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) to assess LULC changes, revealing trends that aligned with the results obtained from supervised classification. The findings from this study offer valuable insights for future land planning and management initiatives in the region.","Thien, Bui Bao","Phuong, Vu Thi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,Agricultural influence,Urbanization,Spatio-temporal variation,Sustainable development,Climate change,Mekong Delta,MEKONG DELTA,COVER,TRANSFORMATION,DISTRICT,GIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2024,"Modeling and assessing spatial and temporal changes in recent agricultural land-use in Ben Tre province, Vietnam"
Row_369,"Climate change and increasing urbanization are two primary factors responsible for the increased risk of serious flooding around the world. The prediction and monitoring of the effects of land use/land cover (LULC) and climate change on flood risk are critical steps in the development of appropriate strategies to reduce potential damage. This study aimed to develop a new approach by combining machine learning (namely the XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, and ExtraTree models) and hydraulic modeling to predict the effects of climate change and LULC change on land that is at risk of flooding. For the years 2005, 2020, 2035, and 2050, machine learning was used to model and predict flood susceptibility under different scenarios of LULC, while hydraulic modeling was used to model and predict flood depth and flood velocity, based on the RCP 8.5 climate change scenario. The two elements were used to build a flood risk assessment, integrating socioeconomic data such as LULC, population density, poverty rate, number of women, number of schools, and cultivated area. Flood risk was then computed, using the analytical hierarchy process, by combining flood hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. The results showed that the area at high and very high flood risk increased rapidly, as did the areas of high/very high exposure, and high/very high vulnerability. They also showed how flood risk had increased rapidly from 2005 to 2020 and would continue to do so in 2035 and 2050, due to the dynamics of climate change and LULC change, population growth, the number of women, and the number of schools - particularly in the flood zone. The results highlight the relationships between flood risk and environmental and socio-economic changes and suggest that flood risk management strategies should also be integrated in future analyses. The map built in this study shows past and future flood risk, providing insights into the spatial distribution of urban area in flood zones and can be used to facilitate the development of priority measures, flood mitigation being most important.","Nguyen, Huu Duy","Nguyen, Quoc-Huy","Dang, Dinh Kha","Van, Chien Pham","Truong, Quang Hai","Pham, Si Dung","Bui, Quang-Thanh","Petrisor, Alexandru-Ionut",,,,,,,,,,,11,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,Flood hazard,Flood risk,Flood exposure,Flood vulnerability,Machine learning,MIKE flood model,Vietnam,HIERARCHY PROCESS AHP,WEST-BENGAL,VULNERABILITY,MODELS,STRATEGIES,CATCHMENT,DISTRICT,INCREASE,HAZARD,DELTA,,,,,,,,,APR 15 2024,A novel flood risk management approach based on future climate and land use change scenarios
Row_370,"To date, the characteristics of the low-level jets (LLJs) that appear below 300 m, referred to in this study as tower-level LLJs (T-LLJs), have remained unidentified. The results in this study show that approximately 22% of LLJs in Tianjin appear below 300 m, indicating that greater attention should be given to T-LLJs. Thus, the characteristics of T-LLJs in Tianjin are investigated using data obtained from a wind-profile radar and a 255-m high meteorological tower. The results show that T-LLJs frequently occur during the transition from the warm season to the cold season and prefer to appear at night. Compared to the LLJs that appear between 300 and 1000 m, T-LLJs exhibit distinct monthly and diurnal variations, likely attributable to specific underlying causes. The case study suggests that the generation of T-LLJs can be partly attributed to inertial oscillation. Moreover, sensitivity tests indicate that the land-sea thermal contrast is one of the main causes of T-LLJs, and that urban heat islands (UHIs) exert nonnegligible influence on T-LLJs in Tianjin. In addition, since UHIs are mainly nocturnal phenomena, the impacts of nocturnal LLJs on UHIs are investigated. The results show that nocturnal LLJs contribute to enhance turbulent mixing and heat transport, which can weaken atmospheric stability near the surface. Consequently, a nocturnal UHI is always weaker when it occurs concurrently with a LLJ, as opposed to occurring without a LLJ.","Ju, Tingting","Wu, Bingui","Li, Zongfei","Liu, Jingle","Zhang, Hongsheng",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES,Low-level jet,Nocturnal boundary layer,Turbulent mixing,Urban heat island,NOCTURNAL BOUNDARY-LAYER,INTERMITTENT TURBULENCE,PART II,CHINA,CITY,CLIMATOLOGY,SIMULATIONS,TRANSPORT,PHOENIX,WIND,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 2023,Characteristics of Tower-Level Low-Level Jets and Their Impacts on the Urban Heat Island in Tianjin

These are situations in which the human body does not experience cold or heat stress and the hypothalamus in the human brain is not stimulated. Uncomfortable conditions cause many social and physical problems. In the study, bioclimatic comfort conditions were determined according to the PET (Physiological Equivalent Temperature) index using the RayMan model. The study developed a new modeling approach for producing bioclimatic comfort maps. The model was making using the measurement of the reference station. Base maps were used for the spatial distribution of PET values. Base maps include the following: elevation, solar radiations, land cover, mean radiant temperature (MRT), and wind velocity. These base maps were used because they vary in short distances and affect PET values. The distribution of bioclimatic comfort conditions and base maps was prepared with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software. The model output has been tested in three different climatic regions. In the tests performed, R2 (correlation coefficient) occurred between 0.996 and 0.999. RMSE (root mean square error) values occurred between 0.53 and 0.57 degrees C. The IA (index of agreement) results were determined as 0.999 in the entire study area. It was see that the result was close to perfect.

Agent-based model (ABM) is a traditional method to simulate activities in a complex system, which has been widely applied in urban studies. However, due to its rigid initial settings, ABM has been criticized for its lack of intelligence, especially in dealing with modern urban issues. With the success of artificial intelligence (AI) and complexity science, it is generally agreed that ABM can be enhanced with AI agents, a promising technology that can bridge the gaps. For that, this article provides a systematic review, in which 10 subsections correspond to 10 different ways that AI can work with ABM in the methodological framework. The sections include that (1) ABM is Al; (2) ABM provides training data for Al; (3) Al provides data for ABM; (4) ABM is a submodule in the ensemble Al; (5) Al leads an optimization framework with ABM participation; (6) Al tunes ABM initialization parameters; (7) Al provides the environment for ABM; (8) Al aids in choosing the agent's attributes; (9) Al provides behaviors for agents in ABM; (10) Al helps to evaluate the performance of ABM.

Row_373,"Urban flooding is a serious challenge in cities owing to global warming and rapid urbanization; thus, urban flood forecasting is required to reduce losses. Nevertheless, owing to the randomness and uncertainty of rainfall and ponding processes, providing accurate and stable ponding predictions using the existing prediction methods is difficult. To address these issues, this study proposes a time-varying criterion to improve the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method and uses the time-varying BMA (TV-BMA) approach to develop an integrated model for predicting urban floods and providing early warning by dynamically coupling the results of the BMA and three machine-learning models. This integrated model was based on numerous measured data on rainfall and ponding processes, aiming to accurately predict real-time changes in ponding depth. The results show that the prediction accuracy of the TV-BMA model was 11.4-50.4 % higher than that of the BMA and individual models, and within the 95 % confidence interval. Moreover, the bandwidth of the TV-BMA model (0.038 m) was 19.1-53.1 % lower than that of the BMA (0.047 m) and individual models (0.063-0.081 m). This demonstrates that the TV-BMA model has significant advantages in correcting deviation and reducing uncertainty in the prediction results. Furthermore, the TV-BMA model has high accuracy in the early warning results for up to a 100-min forecast period (F-score > 0.8). The proposed TV-BMA model can predict urban floods with improved accuracy and stability. It may provide guidance for improving the existing urban flood prediction methods.","Zhou, Yihong","Wu, Zening","Xu, Hongshi","Wang, Huiliang","Ma, Bingyan","Lv, Hong",,,,,,,,,,,,,12,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Urban flood,Flood prediction,Bayesian model averaging,Ponding,CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACT,MODEL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 2023,Integrated dynamic framework for predicting urban flooding and providing early warning

The emulator employs a subset of meteorological, land cover, and emission input variables identical to those in CMAQ. An initial assessment of the model based on 3-fold monthly cross-validation during the summer (JJA) demonstrates excellent accuracy for 1-h NO2 concentration, with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.979 and an Index of Agreement (IOA) of 0.989. Subsequently, the model's robustness is examined by training it with NEI 2011 and 2014 data and then evaluating it using NEI 2017 data. This yields an R of 0.949 and an IOA of 0.974. We utilize the emulator to investigate the semi-normalized sensitivity of NO2 concentrations to NOx emissions, which exhibits a satisfactory alignment with CMAQ Decoupled Direct Method (DDM) sensitivities, with an MAE of 0.271 ppb for 1-h sensitivity coefficients. Diurnal cycle analysis of NOx sensitivity coefficients spatially averaged in 15 major urban environments indicates slight over- and underestimations of the morning and evening peaks, respectively, with the MAE varying from 0.27 (Dallas) to 0.92 ppb (Los Angeles). Remarkably, the emulator's computational efficiency significantly surpasses CMAQ's, providing more than 400 times the simulation speed on a single CPU and over 600 times when utilizing both CPU and GPU.

For community monitoring and evaluation, previous monitored indicators often exhibit variations in spatial/temporal scales and representations, affecting the integration of multiple indicators and overall evaluation of community sustainability. For community optimization, existing spatial optimization and simulation methods ignored the evolutionary processes of communities, making the optimization results far away from the actual development trends.

The spatial scope of the study is the compact city of Sofia. The baseline year is 2018 and the scenario development is up to 2030 with several reference years in between. The methods applied include a wide array of data gathering and processing as well as rapid traffic, activity and morphology mapping and modeling steps and techniques. The traffic distribution model takes into account diverse characteristics of the street network and the spatial development of Sofia. The utilized traffic data is from various sources with poor integrity. In order to obtain a relatively good estimate of the average annual daily traffic for the entire city street and road network, data interpolation and machine learning regression models are tested through QGIS and Python. The relatively large portion of missing data requires pre-processing (filtering) and phased imputation using a well-trained multivariable regression (we found the Random Forest Algorithm to be an excellent choice), preferably with optimally selected parameters. As the latter may differ in the analysis of the main traffic arteries, the primary and the secondary street network, we study each of the clusters separately, allowing given predictions to propagate down the hierarchy. Further on the space-time activity model stems from land use and functional analysis of points of interest with differentiation of the presence of mobility modes and people throughout time. The urban morphology and surface modeling makes use of the Street Canyon Tool from CERC implemented in ArcMap environment as well as the UMEP plugin and other native tools in QGIS. The specific emission scenarios falling under predefined general assumptions are calculated through CERC EMIT and rely on both fleet composition changes and urban plan provisions. The paper raises an array of issues for discussion over the results through the link between emissions generation and exposure settings changing under different conditions as a preliminary step towards spatially and temporally differentiated health impact evaluation. A major conclusion is that the specific configuration of urban street canyons and traffic load in the city impose varying degrees of impacts and risks from the transport sources which need to be addressed by more specific scope and design of measures that can prevent public health in an efficient and equitable manner.","Burov, A.","Brezov, D.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Environmental Protection and Disaster Risks: Proceeding of the 2nd International Conference on Environmental Protection and Disaster Risks and 10th Annual CMDR COE Conference on Crisis Management and Disaster Response.

Row_382,"Surface urban heat island (SUHI) intensity generally determined by satellite-derived clear-sky land surface temperature (LST) has ignored the impacts of cloud coverage and cannot reflect the real SUHI intensity. Only a few studies focus on the effects of this issue based on short-time LST datasets, which could contain non-negligible uncertainties to summarize reliable rules. To investigate the influence, the SUHI intensity (SUHII) clear-sky bias (CSB), CSB ), which is defined as the SUHII difference between clear-sky and all-weather conditions, was investigated in 35 cities in China, based on clear-sky and all-weather LST datasets from 2003 to 2022. Results show that the two SUHIIs show similar spatial distribution patterns, with stronger SUHIs in southern China at daytime and weaker at nighttime. However, a non-negligible difference can be found between these two SUHIIs, with a SUHII CSB range of-1.43 to 2.27 degrees C at daytime and- 2.17 to 0.91 degrees C at nighttime. In terms of intra-annual variation, SUHII CSBs s in similar climate regions exhibit similar patterns but different ranges due to their different natural properties. Generally, intra-annual variations of SUHII CSB can be divided into three groups, i.e., ""Table Mountain"", single peak, and single valley, varying across climate regions and years. The main reason for SUHII CSB was analyzed, i.e., spatial gaps of the data directly caused the SUHII CSB, , and the thermal properties and meteorological conditions of the missing pixels affect the magnitude of the SUHII CSB. . Taking the urban system as an example, this study has provided evidence of the non-negligible SUHII clear-sky bias to emphasize the importance of using all-weather LST for relevant studies.","Ma, Jin","Zhou, Ji","Zhang, Tao","Tang, Wenbin","Liao, Yangsiyu","Yang, Miao",,,,,,,,,,,,,1,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,Surface urban heat island,TRIMS LST,All-weather,Clear-sky bias,CITIES,VALIDATION,SIMULATION,CLIMATE,TRENDS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 1 2024,Non-negligible clear-sky biases of satellite thermal infrared observations for analyzing surface urban heat island intensity: A case study in China
Row_383,"Urban green spaces, crucial for urban residents' wellbeing, offer restorative benefits mainly through natural elements, as established in existing literature which were generally conducted in warm weather. Yet, cold weather modifies how both natural and anthropogenic elements appear and function, and hence their impacts on restorativeness may deviate. In cold weather, whether an urban green space would be overall restorative, and which type of elements would be more beneficial remains poorly understood. Here we present the results of a walk experience experiment with 20 participants on three typical landscape routes in a waterside park in a winter city. Participants' restorative experiences and their visual and auditory exposures were evaluated using the Restorative Experience Scale, eye tracker, and binaural acoustic measurement system. By comparing participants' restorative experience and their visual and auditory exposure, we found that in the cold weather, natural elements vegetation and water surfaces, the appearances of which were subjective to major seasonal changes, ceased to promote restorativeness. Aesthetically pleasing landscape decorations instead promoted the restorativeness of the environment strongly (beta = 0.286, p = 0.004). Additionally, soundscape appropriateness (beta = 0.320, p = 0.002) and lower environmental loudness (for N5, beta = -0.430, p = 0.000) were also strong positive influencers. These collectively explained 49.7 % of the overall restorative experience in a multiple linear regression model (adjusted R2 = 0.497). Our findings should guide the rational wellbeing-directed landscape design of restorative environments in cold regions to allow sustained restorativeness throughout the year.","Zhang, Ruining","Zhu, Ling","Yang, Xinhao","Han, Rumei","Zhang, Yuan","Kang, Jian",,,,,,,,,,,,,3,URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING,Environmental restorativeness,Urban park,Winter city,Wellbeing -directed landscape design,GREEN SPACE,PSYCHOLOGICAL RESTORATION,HEALTH,RECOVERY,EXPOSURE,SOUNDSCAPE,FRAMEWORK,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2024,The effects of interaction with audiovisual elements on perceived restoration in urban parks in freezing weather
Row_384,"Spatial downscaling satellite sensor -derived land surface temperature (LST) is of great importance for various environmental applications. However, the energy balance at the land surface is complex, especially in urban environments. As a result, the complexity of land surface thermal processes and the resulting LST cannot be accurately modeled using common downscaling methods. Here, we propose a new physical approach for LST downscaling based on surface energy balance (SEB) components which can capture this complexity and, thereby, increase the accuracy of downscaling. Experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed SEB approach were undertaken across 23 test sites in Europe and the United States. The research data included the Landsat 8 and Terra satellite sensor imagery products, land cover data, a digital elevation model, surface imperviousness maps and ground station data. Downscaled LST (DLST) maps at different spatial resolutions were produced using the developed SEB-based approach and compared to common benchmark methods including random forest regression (RFR), geographically weighted regression (GWR), area -to -point regression kriging (ATPRK), disaggregation of radiometric surface temperature (DisTrad), and three layers composition (TLC). Using the observed and In -situ LST, and soil temperature data in different land covers and seasonal conditions as the reference, the accuracy of the SEB and common benchmark approaches for LST downscaling were evaluated and compared. The average RMSE (bias) between the observed LST and DLST derived by SEB, RFR, GWR, ATPRK, DisTrad and TLC approaches for the different test areas were 1.15 (-0.42), 1.45 (0.91), 2.11 (1.02), 2.36 (-0.8), 2.79 (-2.31), and 2.45 (-1.48) K, respectively. Accuracy evaluation based on In -situ LST data showed that the RMSE decreased by 0.47-1.96 K (-1.28 K on average) and the bias decreased by 0.15-0.98 K (-0.57 K on average) when the SEB method was applied for LST downscaling in place of the other approaches, respectively. After the SEB approach, RFR approach had higher accuracy than other approaches. The mean RMSE between the observed LST product and the SEB (RFR) derived DLST at spatial resolutions of 480, 320, 240, 192, 120 and 30 m in the warm season were 0.89 (0.95), 0.93 (1.10), 0.99 (1.42), 1.07 (1.52), 1.21 (1.66), and 1.23 (1.94) K, respectively. In the cold season, these values were 0.52 (0.60), 0.58 (0.75), 0.67 (0.93), 0.78 (1.04), 0.87 (1.18), and 0.92 (1.36) K, respectively. Importantly, the effect of target spatial resolution (scale) on DLST accuracy was less acute for the SEB approach than the RFR approach. The mean RMSE between the DLST obtained from SEB (RFR) and the the observed LST for built-up land, cropland, barren land, grassland, shrubland and forest were 11.51 (2.32), 1.21 (1.49), 1.48 (2.04), 1.43 (1.62), 1.51 (1.53), and 1.12 (1.25) K, in the warm season and 0.92 (1.43), 0.76 (0.91), 0.86 (1.20), 0.76 (1.08), 0.77 (1.20), and 0.61 (0.72) K, in the cold season, respectively. The results of this research, thus, demonstrate the high efficiency of the proposed, novel SEB-based approach for downscaling satellite LST at different scales and under different climatic, geographical and environmental conditions.","Firozjaei, Mohammad Karimi","Mijani, Naeim","Kiavarz, Majid","Duan, Si-Bo","Atkinson, Peter M.","Alavipanah, Seyed Kazem",,,,,,,,,,,,,5,REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT,LST downscaling,Spatial resolution,Surface energy balance,Random forest,Accuracy,Satellite imagery,URBAN HEAT ISLANDS,SPATIAL-RESOLUTION,SATELLITE DATA,IN-SITU,HETEROGENEOUS URBAN,SOIL-MOISTURE,DISAGGREGATION,AREA,IMAGES,INDEX,,,,,,,,,,MAY 1 2024,A novel surface energy balance-based approach to land surface temperature downscaling
Row_385,"Groundwater pollution from nickel (Ni) has been a severe concern in Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand. Recent assessments revealed that the Ni concentration in groundwater, particularly in urban areas, often exceeded the permissible limit. The challenge for groundwater agencies is therefore to delineate regions with high susceptibility to Ni contamination. In this study, a novel modeling approach was applied to a dataset of 117 groundwater samples collected from Kanchanaburi Province between April and July 2021. Twenty site-specific initial variables were considered as influencing factors to Ni contamination. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) function was used to select the fourteen most influencing variables. These variables were then used as input features to train a ME model to delineate the Ni contamination susceptibility at a high confidence (Area Under the Curve (AUC) validation value of 0.845). Ten input variables of the altitude, geology, land use, slope, soil type, distance to industrial areas, distance to mining areas, electric conductivity, oxidation-reduction potential, and groundwater depth were discovered in the most explaining the variation of spatial Ni contamination at very high (95.47 km(2)) and high (86.65 km(2)) susceptibility. This study devises the novel machine learning approach to identify the conditioning factors and map Ni contamination susceptibility in the groundwater, which provides a baseline dataset and reliable methods for the development of a sustainable groundwater management strategy.","Thanh, Nguyen Ngoc","Chotpantarat, Srilert","Ha, Nam-Thang","Trung, Nguyen H.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH,Groundwater,Nickel,Random forest,Recursive feature elimination,Maximum entropy,Thailand,HEAVY-METAL CONTAMINATION,RISK-ASSESSMENT,SHALLOW GROUNDWATER,MACHINE,REGRESSION,POLLUTION,ENSEMBLE,AQUIFER,MODELS,REGION,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2023,"Determination of conditioning factors for mapping nickel contamination susceptibility in groundwater in Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand, using random forest and maximum entropy"
Row_386,"The need for resilient stormwater infrastructure is increasingly critical as urbanization and climate change continue to threaten water resources. Engineers and practitioners require reliable methodologies to estimate rainfall-runoff responses to adequately size and design sewer pipes and inlets, flood controls, and stormwater control measures (SCMs). The National Resource Conservation Service Technical Release 55 (often referred to as curve number [CN] method), Simple, and Rational methods are methodologies commonly implemented for such designs by regulatory agencies due to the limited inputs needed to estimate runoff; however, uncertainty is present in each model since they simplify actual hydrological processes. In this study, 13 urban and two forested watersheds were monitored, and their observed hydrologic responses were compared to modeled hydrologic responses utilizing the aforementioned methods. Significant differences in observed normalized runoff volumes (i.e., runoff coefficients) and normalized peak flow rates were found between watersheds with similar watershed characteristics and rainfall patterns, demonstrating the meticulous model inputs required to differentiate hydrologic responses between similar watersheds. A suite of alternative predictive models, informed by feature selection algorithms, were formulated and compared to the performance of standard methods. Results suggested that composite CN methods were the best predictors of event runoff volume across all watersheds (Nash Sutcliffe [NSE] and Kling Gupta Efficiencies [KGE] of 0.74 and 0.52, respectively), but were outperformed by the Simple method for watersheds with more than 45% impervious cover (NSE and KGE scores of 0.85 and 0.76, respectively). However, composite CN methods underestimated runoff volume from every watershed, a limitation that was intended to be addressed through the creation of the distributed CN method. In the distributed approach, runoff volume estimations were improved compared to the composite CN approach only when directly connected impervious area in the watershed was extremely high or extremely low. The multi-linear regression runoff volume model created herein did not outperform traditional runoff models except when rainfall depth was less than 12.5 mm (i.e., the storms for which traditional runoff volume estimation methods performed the worst). Uncertainty in modeled peak flow rate was substantially greater than for runoff volume (NSE and KGE scores between 0.48 - 0.55 and 0.39 - 0.67, respectively) across all methodologies. There is a continued need to develop more dependable estimates of peak flow which are critical to the design of pipes, flood routing, and hydrograph prediction. Overall, these results suggest one model is not optimal in all scenarios. Municipalities, regulatory agencies, and stormwater engineers should consider the adoption of multiple methodologies and use guidance from the results herein to provide recommendations as to when each model is most applicable.","Simpson, Ian M.","Winston, Ryan J.","Tirpak, R.

Row_388,"The paper aims at developing a framework for decision-support to select a sustainable landfill site in Bardaskan City (Iran) by combining life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) concepts and geographic information system (GIS)-based multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM). Overall, 13 criteria were chosen (three constraints and 10 factors) and classified into three main aspects of sustainability (i.e., environmental, social, and economic) to achieve the research goals. Boolean and fuzzy logic were employed to standardize the classified constraints and factors, respectively. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to calculate the factors' weights and then suitability maps were produced using the GIS analysis. The layers were combined using simple additive weighting (SAW). Next, the most sustainable sites were obtained. The results indicated that distance from city backline, groundwater depth, and distance from rural areas were the most significant factors with the weight of 0.338, 0.141, and 0.129, respectively. The final map of suitable sites was created by classifying the SAW layer according to 75, 80, and 85% of suitability to show the high, medium, and low priority areas for landfill site selection, respectively.

Row_389,"The flood processes and control methods in narrow-valley cities exhibit significant differences compared to other regions. Therefore, precise modeling and simulation of their flood processes is crucial. This study focuses on a typical narrow-valley city located in the Loess Plateau of northern China. A hydrodynamic-hydrological coupling model was constructed to simulate the floods, analyzing flood disaster characteristics as well as the effects and differences of various flood control measures in the narrow-valley city. The results indicate: (1) The hydrodynamic-hydrological coupling model proposed in this paper is highly appropriate for accurately simulating floods in narrow-valley cities. A hydrological model was used to generalize the hydrological process in hilly mountainous areas. While a hydrodynamic model was employed to conduct a detailed simulation of the river terrace, where the main urban area is located. After validation through two actual flood events, the model demonstrated satisfactory simulation performance. (2) The flood characteristics of narrow-valley cities differ from those of plain regions mainly because the terrain restricts the spread of floods once they surpass the embankments. This limitation leads to potentially greater inundation risks in such topographical features. Additionally, the elongated distribution of cities in these areas creates spatial disparities in flooding between upstream and downstream areas. (3) There are significant variations in the effectiveness of different flood control measures. Various flood control approaches were modeled and simulated in this paper. Their flood control capabilities were ranked in descending order as: reservoirs, flood diversion channels, and river channel dredging. (4) The combined flood control effect of multiple measures is notably superior to that of individual measures. Among them, the combination of reservoirs and flood diversion channels is optimal, as it regulates the inflow from a large upstream area. The conclusions drawn in this paper can provide a certain degree of reference and basis for the construction of flood models and flood control systems in narrow-valley cities.","Lv, Jiahao","Hou, Jingming","Wang, Tian","Zhou, Wei","Li, Donglai","Tong, Yu","Zhou, Qingshi",,,,,,,,,,,,0,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Coupling model,Narrow-valley city,Flood disaster,Flood control system,RISK,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 2024,The research on narrow-valley city flood control mode based on hydrodynamic-hydrological coupling model
Row_390,"Urbanization shows continuous expansion and development, ushering in the co-evolution of urban environments and vegetation over time. Recent remote sensing-based studies have discovered prevalent vegetation growth enhancement in urban environments. However, whether there is a temporal evolution of the growth enhancement remains unknown and unexplored. Here we expanded the existing framework for assessing the long-term impact of urbanization on veg-etation greenness (enhanced vegetation index, EVI) using long time series of remote sensing images and applied it in Changsha, the capital city of Hunan province in China. Results showed that vegetation growth experienced widespread enhancement from 2000 to 2017, and increased 1.8 times from 2000 to 2017, suggesting strong continuous adaptive capability of vegetation to urban conditions. Although the overall impact of urbanization was negative due to the re-placement of vegetated surfaces, the growth enhancement nevertheless offset or compensated the direct loss of vege-tated cover during urbanization in the magnitude of 28 % in 2000 to 44 % in 2017. Our study also revealed large spatial heterogeneity in vegetation growth response among various districts at different urbanization levels and found an emergent trend under the observed spatial heterogeneity toward an asymptotic maximum with urbanization, showing EVI converges to 0.22 in highly urbanized areas. We further found that the positive effect of urbanization on vegetation growth is a function of urbanization intensity and time, which implies that the effect of the urban environ-ment on vegetation can be simulated and predicted, and can be verified in more cities in the future. Our study is the first to successfully quantify long-term spatial patterns on the co-evolution of urbanization and vegetation, providing a new understanding of the continuous adaptive responses of vegetation growth to urbanization and shedding light on predicting biological responses to future environmental change.","Peng, Xi","Jiang, Shucheng","Liu, Shuguang","Valbuena, Ruben","Smith, Andy","Zhan, Yang","Shi, Yi","Ning, Ying","Feng, Shuailong","Gao, Haiqiang","Wang, Zhao",,,,,,,,3,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,Urbanization,Vegetation growth,Temporal evolution,Regional disparity,Indirect effect,Time-series analysis,NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY,TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS,CLIMATE-CHANGE,CO2,CHINA,URBANIZATION,RESPONSES,GRADIENT,AUTUMN,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 10 2023,Long-term satellite observations show continuous increase of vegetation growth enhancement in urban environment

The present research is a response to the current research gap for exploration of new multimetric methods for measuring anthropogenic pressure, mathematical and statistical analysing it, and presenting research results. The developed method could facilitate the employment of measurable parameters and expert knowledge to represent the scale and diversity of this phenomenon. To this end, the authors used universal and versatile computational GIS algorithms based on advanced geoprocessing tools to propose a set of 18 indicators as potential diagnostic variables for an econometric anthropogenic pressure model. The study area was a 10-km ring around the Krakow city limits (Malopolskie Voivodeship, Poland), a zone under significant development and settlement pressure. Four econometric models were created using backward stepwise regression and linear regression. The diagnostic variables for the linear regression equations were selected with Hellwig's method and expert knowledge. The proposed concept was found to facilitate an effective measurement of anthropogenic pressure and an understanding of the significance of factors that affect it.

Based on the integrated model of the validated Delft3D-FLOW and HEC-RAS hydrodynamic models, the river level process of compound floods was simulated for 24 h, and the effects of extreme compound flood events involving storm surge, rainfall and river flood under future scenarios is analyzed. In this study, the Modaomen waterway in Zhuhai City of China is used as the study area. The results show: (1) The Lognormal distribution is selected as the optimal distribution, and the design values of precipitation and discharge in different recurrence periods are calculated based on Lognormal distribution. The precipitation and discharge for the 100-year return period were 450.3 mm and 51000 m3, respectively, which could be used in the compound flood simulation; (2) The application of Delft3D-FLOW model ensures the accurate simulation of the compound flood process. In the different future scenarios of rising sea levels and increasing wind intensity (WI), the effect of multiple disaster-causing factors results to a more serious inundation than that of a single disaster-causing factor, with the increase of maximum storm surge level from 8.09 % to 20.31 %; and (3) Fluvial flooding and storm surge became the major causes of compound flood when the city coastal protection is vulnerable, while in the city with robust coastal protection, precipitation serves as a main disaster-causing factor. Taking the inundation under scenario S1 as an example, when the seawall elevation is 2 m, the composite flooding causes significant inundation in the riparian area (the total inundation area is 15.29 km2), whereas when the seawall elevation is raised to 2.5 m, the inundation area in the riparian area caused by the compound flood decreases significantly (the total inundation area is 0.03 km2).

Row_393,"Uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) based hyperspectral imaging offers a flexible method for monitoring urban trees. However, its effect on estimating biochemical and biophysical parameters is still unknown. This article examines how spatial and spectral resolution, solar zenith angle (SZA), and diffuse solar irradiance (SKYL) affect chlorophyll content (C-ab) and leaf area index (LAI) estimation using narrow-band indices (NBIs) through three-dimensional radiative simulations. The results show that spatial resolution minimally affects C-ab estimation but significantly impacts LAI, with finer resolutions improving correlation with NBIs. In contrast, spectral resolution has little effect on LAI but greatly influences C-ab, with a 2-nm resolution providing stronger correlations, while resolutions coarser than 6 nm are less sensitive. The C-ab estimation prefers oblique SZAs, while LAI favors nadir SZAs. SKYL has little effect on C-ab and minor impact on LAI. Sunlit pixels outperform shaded ones for C-ab estimation, even at 2-m resolution, while entire-crown pixels show the highest LAI correlation. Different NBI strategies significantly affect LAI estimation but not C-ab. A consistent conclusion emerges from the analysis of correlations between UAV hyperspectral imagery, with varying spatial and spectral resolutions, and corresponding C-ab field measurements. This suggests that the knowledge revealed by the radiative transfer model is applicable to real-world conditions and improves understanding of natural processes without direct measurements.This article enhances the understanding of the influence of observation configurations on C-ab and LAI estimation, offering insights to optimize UAV-based hyperspectral imaging and guide future satellite sensor development for tree monitoring.","Wei, Shanshan","Yin, Tiangang","Yuan, Bo","Lim, Kim Hwa","Liew, Soo Chin","Whittle, Andrew J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,0,IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING,Spatial resolution,Vegetation,Hyperspectral imaging,Estimation,Autonomous aerial vehicles,Indexes,Reflectivity,Monitoring,Lighting,Soil,Chlorophyll content (C-ab),hyperspectral remote sensing,leaf area index (LAI),uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs),SIMULATED ENMAP DATA,VEGETATION INDEXES,RADIATIVE-TRANSFER,SPATIAL-RESOLUTION,SPECTRAL INDEXES,MODEL,FOREST,SENSITIVITY,PREDICTION,INVERSION,,2025,Optimizing UAV Hyperspectral Imaging for Urban Tree Chlorophyll and Leaf Area Index Retrieval

However, the patterns and drivers of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) exports in typhoon-affected watersheds remain poorly understood. Here, the spatiotemporal variation of FIB and its drivers were systematically investigated in a subtropical coastal watershed, namely the Jiulong River Watershed (JRW), by integrating a decade of monthly in-situ observations and applying them to the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The SWAT model was calibrated and validated for streamflow and fecal coliform (FC) simulations with satisfactory performance (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.69 and 0.47, R-2 of 0.72 and 0.60 for streamflow and FC in validation period, respectively). Observations of FC in both the North River (220-5580 cfu.100 mL(-1)) and the West River (3649-46,293 cfu.100 mL(-1)) of the JRW showed significant declining trends from 2010 to 2020. Source attribution analysis of FC export indicated that livestock manure emissions were the largest contributor (>60%) with urban domestic sewage being the least important contributor (<5%). Furthermore, our observation and modeling results show that FC exports were markedly enhanced during high rainfall events and typhoons, while FC exports decreased during the winter when the climate is dry and cold. The FC loads ranged from 2.6 x 10(7) to 2.8 x 10(10) cfu.L-1.s(-1), with the average loads in agriculture, nature, and urban watershed accounting for 6.3 x 109, 8.3 x 10(8), and 7.4 x 10(9) cfu.L-1.s(-1), respectively. Our data support that the FC loads are closely related to anthropogenic indicators and are significantly higher in urban and agricultural watersheds than in natural or pristine watersheds. Future climate change with more frequent rainfall extremes will likely intensify FC exports. Such findings have important implications regarding mitigating FIB pollution for subtropical coastal watersheds under the context of climate change and increasing human impacts.","Xie, Zheyu","Chen, Shengyue","Huang, Jinliang","Li, Dongfeng","Lu, Xixi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,Fecal indicator bacteria,Land use pattern,Hydrological regime,Soil and water assessment tool,Subtropical coastal watershed,INDICATOR BACTERIA,WATERBORNE PATHOGEN,RIVER-BASIN,TRANSPORT,FATE,QUALITY,SEWAGE,CONTAMINATION,CALIBRATION,CALIFORNIA,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 20 2023,Patterns and drivers of fecal coliform exports in a typhoon-affected watershed: insights from 10-year observations and SWAT model

To complement the experiments we include a small test with a fixed-wing plane to asses the software-in-the-loop accuracy on larger trajectories. Results demonstrate successful tracking of altitude variations, yielding errors below 10% relative to the home position in experiments with average trajectory lengths of 150 m in two scenarios in Quito. The software-in-the-loop simulation aimed to replicate wind conditions specific to the date and time of real data acquisition, providing a platform to emulate possible improvements and assess UAV performance before deployment in actual missions. This research not only contributes to the optimization of monitoring capabilities but also serves as a valuable tool for assessing UAV missions in diverse and dynamic environments.","Chamorro, William","Toapanta, Franciso","Carrillo, Andrey","Loyaga, Erick","Valencia, Esteban",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"2024 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS, ICUAS",Software-in-the-loop,Ardupilot,ROS,Gazebo,wind perturbation,SIMULATION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024,Open-Source Software-in-the-Loop Strategies for Realistic UAV Monitoring Applications
Row_396,"Change detection is a critical task in remote sensing image analysis, with applications in land management and urban development. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown success in this area, but existing CNN-based methods often struggle with irrelevant changes caused by interfering factors, leading to unsatisfactory results. To address this, some studies have replaced CNN layers with transformers to enhance the receptive field and utilize global information better. However, this can make models overly reliant on global information, potentially overlooking shallow, fine-grained features, especially at the edges of changed targets. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Nested Transformer Decoder (NTD) that combines the strengths of transformers and CNNs by introducing dense skip connections. While having a large receptive field, it can also better retain shallow and fine-grained features by adding skip-connection. These innovations enable our model to more accurately identify changes and preserve the edges of the changed areas, including small changes that are difficult to detect using existing methods. Additionally, we introduce a Residual Fusion Module (RFM) to reduce false detections caused by irrelevant factors like light and shadow. The RFM employs residual information and spatiotemporal attention to suppress differences in multi-scale features, leading to better detection outcomes. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms the current state-of-the-art change detection methods in various metrics, and represents a novel and effective solution to the challenge of change detection in remote sensing images. Experimental results show that our model surpasses state-of-the-art change detection methods across various metrics. Tested on three public change detection datasets, our method improves the Intersection over Union (IoU) for the change class by 2.83% to 16.39% and enhances the F1-score by 1.60% to 9.63%. These results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides an effective solution to the challenges of change detection in remote sensing images.","Meng, Xiangjun","Song, Yonghong","Li, Guofu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING,Change detection(CD),deep learning,transformer,skip connection,High-resolution optical(HR) remote sensing(RS) image,NETWORK,FUSION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 16 2024,Nested transformer decoder using dense skip-connections for change detection in high-resolution remote sensing image
Row_397,"Fragmentation profoundly alters the character and pattern of forests, influencing biodiversity in the context of global climate change. Forest area density (FAD) is currently considered the most effective method for characterizing forest fragmentation. Therefore, reasonable and accurate quantification of FAD and its relationship with forest cover changes are essential for evaluating forest fragmentation in the Loess Plateau under the implementation of the Grain-for-Green Program (GGP). Based on land use/cover (LULC) in 1998-2022, we integrated the Random forest (RF) algorithm and the conversion of land use and its effects at small regional extent (CLUE-S) model to derive LULC in 2030. Subsequently, we proposed a multi-scale window threshold to evaluate forest fragmentation by constructing nonlinear models. Furthermore, we explored the relationship between FAD and forest cover changes by spatial regression models. The results are as follows: (1) in 1998-2030, the main conversion of LULC was of the cropland to broad-leaf forests and grassland. (2) The 43 x 43 window served as the optimal multi-scale threshold to assess forest fragmentation. (3) The GGP slowed down forest fragmentation. (4) The degree of fragmentation in broad-leaf forests was higher than that in coniferous forests. (5) Spatial error model (SEM) was the most appropriate for establishing the spatial relationship between forest fragmentation and forest cover changes. In conclusion, since the implementation of the GGP, forest cover changes had a significant impact on forest fragmentation and its multi-scale threshold. This research provides a basis for the reasonable configuration of land resources in the Loess Plateau and novel methods for studying forest cover changes and fragmentation.","Zhang, Mei","Yu, Shichuan","Ye, Quanping","Li, Zhen","Yin, Daihao","Zhao, Zhong",,,,,,,,,,,,,4,LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT,Conversion of Land Use and its Effects at Small Regional Extent (CLUE-S) model,forest area density (FAD),forest cover changes,forest fragmentation,spatial regression analysis,threshold,LAND-USE CHANGE,LOESS PLATEAU,CLIMATE-CHANGE,ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION,URBAN FORM,COVER,CHINA,VEGETATION,IMPACTS,TEMPERATURE,,,,,,,,,,JUL 15 2023,Effect of the Grain-for-Green Program on forest fragmentation

GAI has recently shown impressive results across a large spectrum of applications ranging from biology, medicine, education, legislation, computer science, and finance. As one strives for enhanced safety, efficiency, and sustainability, generative AI indeed emerges as a key differentiator and promises a paradigm shift in the field. This paper explores the potential applications of generative AI and large language models in geoscience. The recent developments in the field of machine learning and deep learning have enabled the generative model's utility for tackling diverse prediction problems, simulation, and multi-criteria decision-making challenges related to geoscience and Earth system dynamics.

Row_399,"Understanding and assessing hydroclimate changes is essential to provide reliable information in developing countries such as Senegal in order to guide adaptation strategies. In this work, we have examined the projected changes in temperature and precipitation over the six eco-geographical zones in Senegal. Furthermore, we have assessed the river flow changes in the three major river basins (Casamance, Gambia, Senegal). Climate simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) were analyzed. The ensemble mean of the climate models projects a continued increase in mean, minimum and maximum temperatures across Senegal (up to more than 4 °C in the long term under the SSP5-8.5 scenario). The projected warming is greater in eastern Senegal and the Sylvo-pastoral zone. As for rainfall, it is characterized by very high interannual variability; the projections show decreasing trend from 2015 to 2100. The groundnut basin is the most area affected by the decrease in rainfall (24%). However, slight humidity conditions are projected for the near future (2021-2040). The downward trend of rainfall is much more pronounced around 2045 to 2100. In addition, we found a slight increase in extreme wet events that are more marked in the near future. This could increase the risk of flooding in urban and peri-urban areas. Moreover, future flows are strongly impacted by climate change. Thus, the stations of Kolda (Casamance River), Gouloumbou (Gambia River) and Kidira (Senegal River) could experience a slight increase in flow rates (up to 20%) by 2030; while by 2060 and 2100, a decline of about 40% is projected.

Row_400,"Most of China's carbon sink inversion research uses global atmospheric transport models to assimilate natural fluxes, which quantifies the biosphere and ocean carbon budget with a relative coarse spatial resolution and long timescale from a weekly or monthly perspective. Toward high-resolution inversion of CO2 fluxes, a novel carbon flux forecast model was developed in this study, which was then further used to carry out carbon assimilation based on a regional chemical transport model (CMAQ) at higher spatial (64 x 64 km(2)) and temporal (1 hr) resolutions. An Ensemble Kalman Smoother was applied as the assimilation algorithm and further extended to assimilate surface CO2 observations. Concentrations and fluxes were simultaneously assimilated as state variables to help reduce the uncertainty in the initial CO2 fields with the joint data assimilation framework (JDAS). In general, the posterior fluxes reproduced the seasonal, daily and hourly variation effectively, demonstrating the ability to fully absorb and utilize observations. Moreover, the influence of the choice of assimilation window on the carbon flux inversion was assessed via sensitivity experiments, revealing 36 hr to be the optimum length. Evaluation of the prior and posterior flux simulations also indicated that JDAS offers reasonable improvements, making it suitable for fine-scale flux optimization and estimation. In addition, the posterior biosphere estimation in mainland China (-682 TgC yr(-1)) tends to be the optimal mathematical solution under current sparse observation coverage with daytime photosynthetic uptake, which likely leads to the overestimation of the optimized CO2 sink. This study serves as a basis for future regional and urban assessment.Plain Language Summary Top-down methods are used increasingly to constrain the carbon budget under the Monitoring and Verification Support framework by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Different to previous attempts to assimilate China's carbon sink from a weekly or monthly perspective, we developed a novel regional carbon inversion system based on Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) and Ensemble Kalman Smoother with surface observations toward high-resolution inversion of CO2 fluxes. Besides the forward, fine-scale simulation by CMAQ, a flux forecast model with diurnal variation capability was also introduced to facilitate illustrating the hourly evolution of ensemble fluxes. The results indicate that our posterior fluxes reproduced the seasonal, daily and hourly variation effectively, which suggests the method provides a promising tool for future monitoring of the effectiveness of progress toward carbon neutrality.","Peng, Zhen","Kou, Xingxia","Zhang, Meigen","Lei, Lili","Miao, Shiguang","Wang, Hengmao","Jiang, Fei","Han, Xiao","Fang, Shuangxi",,,,,,,,,,2,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 16 2023,"CO2 Flux Inversion With a Regional Joint Data Assimilation System Based on CMAQ, EnKS, and Surface Observations"
Row_401,"Land subsidence is a worldwide geo-environmental hazard. Clarifying the influencing factors of land subsidence hazards susceptibility (LSHS) and their spatial distribution are critical to the prevention and control of subsidence disasters. In this study, we selected natural and anthropogenic features or variables on LSHS and used the interpretable convolutional neural network (CNN) method to successfully construct a LSHS model in China. The model performed well, with AUC and F1 -score testing set accuracies reaching 0.9939 and 0.9566, respectively. The interpretable method of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was use to elucidate the individual contribution of input features to the predictions of CNN model. The importance ranking of model variables showed that population, gross domestic product (GDP) and groundwater storage (GWS) change are the three major factors that affect China's land subsidence. During year 2004-2016, an area of 237.6 thousand km2 was classified as high and very high LSHS, mainly concentrated in the North China Plain, central Shanxi, southern Shaanxi, Shanghai and the junction of Jiangsu and Zhejiang.

However, current research on the use and redevelopment of post-industrial sites has mainly focused ecological restoration, and studies combined with objective and subjective data to quantify public preferences remain poorly understood.

We investigated and found Semantic segmentation models for machine learning combined with principal component analysis (PCA) and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis can categorize post-industrial parks into two groups dominated by artificial elements and natural elements.

Due to the existence of a multivariate function and the dependence of some parameters on each other, it was necessary to use intelligent functions in modeling subsidence events. The study area is Abarkooh plain, with an area of about 200 square kilometers as part of the Eqlid-Abarkooh watershed. For predicting sinkhole hazards in the study area by artificial intelligence model (ANNs, DT and SVM), the input data were physiography of the study area, and 130 soil samples taken from soil surface for chemical, physical, and mechanical analyses. GPR surveys were performed to detect breaks in stratigraphy and sinkholes in the subsurface to depth until 5 m. The results showed that the models predicted well the sinkhole hazard, and that some soil parameters, including Mg2+ in the soil and lime, COLE and EC have the most impact on creating sinkholes in the study area. The GPR results showed some geological horizons inremptions and subsurface holes in subsoils.

Row_404,"Urban flooding is escalating worldwide due to the increasing impervious surfaces from urban developments and frequency of extreme rainfall events by climate change. Traditional flood extent prediction and mapping methods based on physical-based hydrological principles often face limitations due to model complexity and computational burden. In response to these challenges, there has been a notable shift toward satellite image processing and Artificial Intelligence (AI) based approaches, such as Deep Learning (DL) models, including architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The objective of this research is to predict near real-time (NRT) flood extents within urban areas. This research integrated CNN (U-Net) with Sentinel-1 satellite imagery, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), hydrologic soil group (HSG), imperviousness, and rainfall data to create a flood extent prediction model. To detect flooded areas, a binary raster map was created using calibrated backscatter values derived from the VV (vertical transmit and vertical receive) polarization mode of Sentinel-1 imagery, which was highlighted as having a significant impact on backscatter behavior and prediction results. Application of the model was demonstrated in urban areas of Miami-Dade County, Florida. The results demonstrated the capability of the model to provide rapid and accurate flood extent predictions at a spatial resolution of 10 m, with an overall accuracy of 97.05 %, F-1 Score of 92.49 %, and AUC of 93 % in the study area. The U-Net model's flood predictions were compared with historical floodplain data and then using GIS overlay analysis, resulting in a Ground Truth Index of 84.05 % that shows the accuracy of the model in identifying flooded areas. The research incorporated crucial flood-influencing data (including rainfall) to the flood extent prediction models and expanded the focus models beyond major rainfall events only to encompass a wider range of flood events. The presented NRT flood extent mapping model has a broad range of applicability, including, but not limited to, the continuous monitoring of flood events and their potential impacts on civil infrastructure assets (e.g., construction, operation, and maintenance of roads and bridges), early warning systems for timely evacuation and preparedness measures, and insurance risk assessment.","Mohamadiazar, Nasim","Ebrahimian, Ali","Hosseiny, Hossein",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Near Real -Time Flood Mapping,Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN),U -Net,Machine Learning,Florida,Sentinel-1,EFFECTIVE IMPERVIOUS AREA,LAND-USE,IMPACT,RUNOFF,MODELS,BASIN,TIDES,,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 2024,"Integrating deep learning, satellite image processing, and spatial-temporal analysis for urban flood prediction"

Row_406,"Aerosols play an essential role in the energy cycle of land-atmosphere systems through interactions with radiation and clouds. Aerosol-induced direct radiative effect (ADRE) has a large effect on the photosynthetic processes of vegetation in terrestrial ecosystems. We used the Fu-Liou radiation transfer model integrated with the Community Land Model (CLM) to quantify ADRE and the responses of vegetation photosynthetic processes to ADRE in China from 2001 to 2014. The aerosols exhibited a positive effect on the diffuse fraction and it increased at first and decreased later. Positive impacts of ADRE on the leaf area index (LAI) of both sun (LAISUN) and shaded leaves (LAISHA) were captured in most areas of China, with increases of 0.01 and 0.09, respectively. The changes in LAI caused by ADRE were consistent with aerosol loading in northern and eastern China. In addition, due to the large decrease in total radiation caused by aerosols, ADRE reduced the photosynthetic rate of sun leaves. However, when the aerosol optical depth (AOD) ranged from 0.50 to 0.57, ADRE had positive effects on the photosynthetic rate of shaded leaves, and the AOD interval for positive impacts on the photosynthetic rate was different in each subregion of China. Mechanistic analysis found that ADRE could reduce the ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) carboxylase-limited rate of carboxylation and enhance the light-limited rate.

Row_407,"Remote sensing images are widely used in land monitoring, environmental perception, disaster prediction and urban analysis. Most commercial satellites such as WorldView-4, QuickBird and WorldView-2 are equipped with sensors that can obtain panchromatic images and multispectral images at the same time. Panchromatic images have high spatial resolution but have only one band. The spatial resolution of multispectral images is low due to the bandwidth limitation of the equipment. In order to obtain more accurate details of the measured object, panchromatic image and multispectral image can be fused to generate images with both high spatial resolution and high spectral resolution. Fusion methods of multispectral and panchromatic images can be divided into four categories: multi-resolution analysis method, component substitution method, variational optimization method and deep learning method. Compared with traditional methods, deep learning has stronger feature extraction ability, so it is widely used. Currently, transformer structure is introduced into advanced remote sensing image fusion method. Aiming at the problem that existing methods based on transformer fail to fully integrate multi-scale features of remote sensing images, this paper proposes a multispectral-panchromatic fusion network MSCANet, based on improved Swin transformer. The model extracts features of multispectral images and panchromatic images respectively by using two-flow branches. The downsampled feature images are cascaded and fed into the fusion network. In order to improve the robustness of feature extraction in various complex ground scenes, a Multiscale Swin-transformer with Channel Attention (MSCA) unit is integrated in the fusion part. The unit replaces the MLP part of Swin transformer into a cascade module of multi-scale convolution and channel attention, which can better fuse the feature information of ground objects of different sizes in remote sensing images and use the long-range dependence between regions. The fusion network focus on predicting the high-frequency details lost in multispectral images. Then high frequency details are added to the original image to restore a high resolution multispectral image. Simulation experiment and real experiment of three commercial satellites are conducted. In the experiment of simulation data, the fusion results were evaluated by calculating the difference between the reference image and the simulation dataset. Compared with other methods, MSCANet has the best performance in visual performance and quantitative metrics. Compared with the method with the second performance, the ERGAS index of MSCANet in the three datasets decreased by 11.99%, 0.4% and 3.43%, respectively. In the experiment of three real datasets, combining visual effect and quantitative metrics analysis, the result of MSCANet is the best. Ablation experiments were conducted for the three fusion strategies proposed in this paper. The experimental result shows that the injected model used in this paper outperforms the non-injected model. It also proves that the replacement of MLP module in MSCA module and the addition of attention mechanism are conducive to the improvement of fusion performance. Also, the addition of spectral loss and spatial structure loss on the basis of MAE loss is effective for the improvement of spectral fidelity and spatial resolution. In conclusion, the effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by comparison and ablation experiments. In future work, MSCANet is expected to be migrated to the fusion of multispectral image and hyperspectral image, visible image and infrared image, and other similar tasks to improve the generalization of the model proposed in this paper.","Li, Z.","Zhao, J.","Xu, J.","Long, H.","Liu, C.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Acta Photonica Sinica,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023,Remote Sensing Image Fusion Method Based on Improved Swin Transformer

The long baseline is indispensable for P-band SAR systems to achieve high elevation resolution. It will introduce two problems. On the one hand, the unavoidable spatial decorrelation brings serious phase noise and sidelobes in 3-D imaging. On the other hand, the noticeable image distortion fails the image registration and the TomoSAR data stack (TDS) construction. Aiming at the above problems, this article proposes a multimaster (MM) TomoSAR approach via three main contributions. First, the traditional TomoSAR signal model is extended to the MM case to improve the number of baselines and the average image coherence of the TDS and suppress the sidelobes. Second, a short-baseline-recursion image registration method is proposed to achieve high-precision image registration. Third, a TDS optimization processing consisting of interferometric SAR (InSAR) phase screening and baseline sign reassignment is introduced.

The technique was verified using numerical simulation for various surfaces such as vegetation, urban, and sea surfaces, demonstrating unique inversion with reasonable accuracy. The technique was also validated using real PolSAR images obtained by Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS-2).

Row_410,"This study explores the conservation of historic flyway corridors for egret in the Greater Bay Area (GBA), with a focus on habitat connectivity and dynamic corridors. To address the gaps in previous research, we used field observations, bio-climatic data and landcover information spanning three decades. Our approach involves MaxENT modeling and the Linkage Mapper method. The results showed that the MaxENT model effectively simulated the egret habitats at different levels, with coastlines and riverbanks emerging as primary habitat zones. Moreover, bio-climatic factors, particularly Bio 19 and Bio 8, played a dominant role, accounting for 90 % of the habitat suitability in 2020. Other factors contributed rather minimally. Through the utilization of resistance surface and corridor extraction methods, noteworthy alterations in the flyway networks emerged post-2000, followed by a gradual return to normal. Connectivity analyses highlighted a critical 30 km threshold for the egret preservation. Corridor widths should be determined based on cost-effective considerations. We conclude that combining MaxENT with the Linkage Mapper method, even with limited egret observations and integrating multi-source data, such as land cover, might simulate potential suitable habitats and flyway dynamics for waterbirds such as egrets.

However, the variance of DOM in different landcover areas of an urban river riparian zone is unknown. In this study, fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy coupled with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) and partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM) was applied to character dissolved organic matter (DOM) fractions in four types of landcover riparian areas (natural forest, artificial forest, semi-natural grassland, and cropland) of Puhe River and trace latent factors. Soil samples were collected at 0-20 cm, 20-40 cm, 40-60 cm, and 60-80 cm. The results showed that soil DOM components and humification varied between forests with grassland and cropland samples, and soil humification was obviously higher in the forest samples than that in the grassland and cropland samples. In the natural and artificial forest soils, the humic/fulvic-like were the dominant fractions of DOM, whose variations were smaller than the protein-like with soil depths. However, the tyrosine-like was the representative component in the grassland and cropland soils, whose variation was smaller than the humus substances. According to the PLS-SEM, the DOM components and humification were affected by soil physiochemical properties and DOM sources. The humification in the forest soils had a positive correlation with tryptophan-like, which derived from blended source of the autochthonous and terrigenous. Nevertheless, a positive correlation was observed between humification and humus substances, which could derive from microbial degradation of tyrosine-like, in the","Zhang, Xiulei","Yu, Huibin","Gao, Hongjie","Lu, Kuotian","Liu, Dongping",,,,,,,,,,,,,,11,SPECTROCHIMICA ACTA PART A-MOLECULAR AND BIOMOLECULAR SPECTROSCOPY,DOM,EEM,PARAFAC,PLS-SEM,Riparian zone,DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER,EXCITATION-EMISSION MATRIX,CHONGMING ISLAND,LAND-USE,VEGETATION TYPES,FLUORESCENCE,QUALITY,IDENTIFICATION,SPECTROSCOPY,TRACKING,,,,,,,,,,,APR 15 2023,Explore variations of DOM components in different landcover areas of riparian zone by EEM-PARAFAC and partial least squares structural equation model
Row_412,"Due to the complicated and uncertain dynamics of the urban heat island (UHI) in humid subtropical areas, the diurnal, seasonal and long-term variations of the UHI were investigated in Rasht, Iran. Besides, the study utilizes the heat and moisture transfer concepts to analyze the impacts of daytime rainfall duration on UHI. Meteorological data at five virtual stations was acquired by verified Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Overall, the nighttime UHI peaks in summer (3.4 degrees C) and is lowest in fall (1.4 degrees C) over 2017-2019. Moreover, the maximum and minimum daytime UHI occurred in winter (1.2 degrees C) and summer (0.6 degrees C), respectively. In hot seasons, an increase in daytime precipitation duration initially leads to an increase in daytime UHI, followed by a subsequent decrease. Conversely, in cold seasons, daytime UHI shows a decreasing trend regardless of rain conditions. Additionally, extended daytime precipitation attenuates nocturnal UHI in hot seasons, while no significant influence is observed in cold seasons. An increase in midday cloud cover during hot seasons reduces the nighttime UHI. The nighttime UHI is inversely proportional to the third root of wind speed, in low cloudiness conditions of hot seasons. Furthermore, the Ladsat-5/7/8 imageries revealed an increasing trend in the surface UHI (SUHI) during hot seasons over the past two decades, while SUHI in cold seasons remains insignificant. The article reports the most influential parameters on daytime, nighttime and seasonal UHI and the best mitigation policies for the humid subtropical climate, particularly in hot seasons.","Orkomi, Ali Ahmadi","Ameri, Mastooreh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY,Climate,Precipitation,Rasht,Temperature,UHI,WRF,LAND-SURFACE TEMPERATURES,CITY,CITIES,ENERGY,SIMULATIONS,PERFORMANCE,GREEN,TIME,AREA,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 1 2024,"Investigating the intensity of urban heat island and the impacts of local climate using verified WRF data: A case study of Rasht, Northern Iran"
Row_413,"Satellite observations of coastal Louisiana indicate an overall land loss over recent decades, which could be attributed to climate and human-induced factors, including sea level rise (SLR). Climate-induced hydrological change (CHC) has impacted the way flood control structures are used, altering the spatiotemporal water distribution. Based on ""what-if "" scenarios, we determine relative impacts of SLR and CHC on increased flood risk over southern Louisiana and examine the role of water management, via flood control structures, in mitigating flood risk over the region. Our findings show that CHC has increased flood risk over the past 28 years. The number of affected people increases as extreme hydrological events become more exceptional. Water management reduces flood risk to urban areas and croplands, especially during exceptional hydrological events. For example, currently (i.e., 2016-2020 period), CHC-induced flooding puts an additional 73 km(2) of cropland under flood risk at least half of the time (median flood event) and 65 km(2) once a year (annual flood event), when compared to a past period (1993-1997). A 10- to 20-fold increase relative to SLR-induced flooding. CHC also increases population vulnerability in southern Louisiana to flooding; additional 9,900 residents currently live under flood risk at least half of the time, and that number increases to 27,400 for annual flood events. Residents vulnerable to SLR-induced flooding is lower (6,000 and 3,300 residents, respectively). Conclusions are that CHC is a major factor that should be accounted for flood resilience and that water management interventions can mitigate risks to human life and activities.","Getirana, Augusto","Kumar, Sujay","Konapala, Goutam","Nie, Wanshu","Locke, Kim","Loomis, Bryant","Birkett, Charon","Ricko, Martina","Simard, Marc",,,,,,,,,,1,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,flood risk,flood modeling,climate change,human impacts,water management,SURFACE-WATER,AMAZON BASIN,RESOLUTION,CYCLE,DELTA,ASSIMILATION,SIMULATION,PARAMETERS,FRAMEWORK,DYNAMICS,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 2023,Climate and Human Impacts on Hydrological Processes and Flood Risk in Southern Louisiana
Row_414,"Winter deicers are a major source of chloride contamination to shallow aquifers in northern latitudes. In the greater Chicago area of northeast Illinois, chloride has been accumulating for decades and in many places now exceeds the United States Environmental Protection Agency secondary standard of 250 mg/L. MODFLOW-NWT and MT3D-USGS were used to simulate the accumulation of chloride with 30 years of data in the shallow aquifer of Will County in northeast Illinois. This aquifer is composed of unconsolidated sediments, largely from glacial deposits, overlying a fractured dolomite bedrock. To calibrate to observed heads and chloride, the model needed refined geologic features, higher chloride concentrations on cells representing commercial or industrial lands, lower chloride concentrations on cells representing roads, and point source areas to speed chloride's emergence in the aquifer. These point sources are locally significant and could represent different anthropogenic or geologic features, such as municipal stormwater infrastructure. Future simulations indicate that chloride is not at steady state in the shallow aquifer and wells are at risk of exceeding the secondary standard if winter deicing applications are not reduced. It may take decades for the full impacts of reduced deicing rates to be observed in wells, owing to the long residence time of water in the aquifer. This transient model calibration was possible because of the 30-year dataset collected by communities and government agencies.","Cullen, Cecilia","Abrams, Daniel B.","Mannix, Devin H.","Kelly, Walton R.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,groundwater,chloride,MODFLOW,model calibration,salt,deicers,ROAD SALT,WATER-QUALITY,URBAN-GROWTH,DEICING SALT,GROUNDWATER,ILLINOIS,IMPACTS,SURFACE,VULNERABILITY,TRANSPORT,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2023,Calibrating a model to 30 years of data to capture the accumulation of chloride from winter deicers in a shallow aquifer
Row_415,"Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography (TomoSAR) retrieves three-dimensional (3-D) information from multiple SAR images, effectively addresses the layover problem, and has become pivotal in urban mapping. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has gained popularity as a TomoSAR platform, offering distinct advantages such as the ability to achieve 3-D imaging in a single flight, cost-effectiveness, rapid deployment, and flexible trajectory planning. The evolution of compressed sensing (CS) has led to the widespread adoption of sparse reconstruction techniques in TomoSAR signal processing, with a focus on $\ell _1$ norm regularization and other grid-based CS methods. However, the discretization of illuminated scene along elevation introduces modeling errors, resulting in reduced reconstruction accuracy, known as the ""off-grid"" effect. Recent advancements have introduced gridless CS algorithms to mitigate this issue. This paper presents an innovative gridless 3-D imaging framework tailored for UAV-borne TomoSAR. Capitalizing on the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) redundancy inherent in slow UAV platforms, a multiple measurement vectors (MMV) model is constructed to enhance noise immunity without compromising azimuth-range resolution. Given the sparsely placed array elements due to mounting platform constraints, an atomic norm soft thresholding algorithm is proposed for partially observed MMV, offering gridless reconstruction capability and super-resolution. An efficient alternative optimization algorithm is also employed to enhance computational efficiency. Validation of the proposed framework is achieved through computer simulations and flight experiments, affirming its efficacy in UAV-borne TomoSAR applications.","Gao, S.","Wang, W.","Wang, M.","Zhang, Z.","Yang, Z.","Qiu, X.","Zhang, B.","Wu, Y.",,,,,,,,,,,0,A Robust Super-resolution Gridless Imaging Framework for UAV-borne SAR Tomography [arXiv],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024,A Robust Super-resolution Gridless Imaging Framework for UAV-borne SAR Tomography [arXiv]

One of the area most severely affected by ground fissures is the Weihe Basin in North China, which has the most extensive distribution of ground fissures and all the elements that control their occurrence, providing an ideal study area for the study of ground fissures. In this study, we took the eastern Weihe Basin as the study area and determined the distribution and hazard characteristics of ground fissures via field investigation. Based on the analytic hierarchy process, we propose a multi-level, comprehensive method for evaluating the hazards of ground fissures. This method considers the geological background, development status, and triggering factors of ground fissures, including all nine currently known assessment indices of ground fissures. We used judgment matrices to rank the constructed ground fissure assessment index system at the single and total levels and quantified the nine assessment indices of ground fissures according to the field survey data. Finally, we plotted the ground fissure risk zoning map and evaluated the ground fissure risk at the study area.

This paper comprehensively reviewed accuracies and spatio-temporal patterns of 25 state-of-the-art global datasets of land surface ET from 2001 to 2018, where the global and/or local distributions of annual mean, interannual variability, and annual trend for both ET and its components [canopy transpiration (Ec), soil evaporation (Es), and interception evaporation (Ei)] were investigated. Overall, 23 out of the 25 ET products exhibited good consistency with monthly eddy covariance observations at 83 globally distributed sites, with the root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from similar to 19 mm/month to similar to 29 mm/month and the coefficient of determination (R-2) ranging from 0.45 to 0.76. Comparatively, almost all ET products were in good agreement with the water balance-based observations at 137 large basins worldwide, with the R-2 of >0.60 and the RMSE ranging from similar to 200 mm/yr to similar to 260 mm/yr. In general, remote sensing-based, machine learning-based, and hybrid-based ET products generally agreed better with site observations than reanalysis-based products. Global annual ET ranged from 530 mm/yr to 700 mm/yr with the ensemble mean of 628 +/- 44 mm/yr (excluding areas of the urban, barren, wetlands, permanent snow and ice, and water bodies). Most products captured consistent global spatial distributions of annual mean, interannual variability, and annual trends of land surface ET and its components. Both mean annual ET and its components generally decreased with increasing latitudes though with an increasing trend in time. Interannual variability also decreased with increasing latitudes and with an increasing trend in time, but only in the Northern Hemisphere; these signals were not clear in the Southern Hemisphere. Most of the 25 products presented unimodal shapes of frequency curves, and displayed a sequenced multi-year mean of seasonal ET of JJA > MAM > SON > DJF. The Ec exhibited the largest mean annual value, in most areas followed successively by the Es and Ei. The ET products displayed a relatively high consistency in the spatial distribution of the Ec/ET with higher estimates of Ec/ET in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern Hemisphere. This up-to-date review could benefit the understanding of the states and advances of global ET datasets, afford scientific instruction for the development and improvement of ET models and products, and serve as a basis for the choice of ET datasets for specific use.","Tang, Ronglin","Peng, Zhong","Liu, Meng","Li, Zhao-Liang","Jiang, Yazhen","Hu, Yongxin","Huang, Lingxiao","Wang, Yizhe","Wang, Junrui","Jia, Li","Zheng, Chaolei","Zhang, Yongqiang","Zhang, Ke","Yao, Yunjun","Chen, Xuelong","Xiong, Yujiu","Zeng, Zhenzhong","Fisher, Joshua B.",7,REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT,Evapotranspiration,Canopy transpiration,Soil evaporation,Interception evaporation,Spatio-temporal pattern,Latent heat flux,Remote sensing,ATMOSPHERE WATER FLUX,LATENT-HEAT FLUX,TERRESTRIAL EVAPOTRANSPIRATION,EDDY-COVARIANCE,MODEL,EVAPORATION,ENERGY,CARBON,UNCERTAINTY,ALGORITHM,,,,,,,,,APR 1 2024,Spatial-temporal patterns of land surface evapotranspiration from global products

Exploring the spatiotemporal variation patterns and influencing mechanisms of impervious surface evaporation at the catchment scale can improve the understanding and evaluation of the evaporation process. This study downloaded 0.5 m resolution images of the Baiyangdian catchment (BYD) from Google Earth and used deep learning to identify impervious surfaces. This was used to revise impervious surfaces of the China land cover dataset in 1985 and 1990-2020. Potential evaporation (PET) from three types of impervious surfaces (roofs, ground affected or not affected by the building height) was calculated by modifying the parameters of the Penman-Monteith equation, and daily precipitation and water-storage capacity of impervious surfaces were taken into account to estimate impervious surface evaporation (E). The results showed that E values of the three types of impervious surfaces were between 72.1 and 178.2 mm/year and all exhibited the spatial distribution of high in the northwest and low in the southeast of the BYD in 1980-2020. Compared with that in 1980, in 2020, the cumulative evaporation (EAP) increased by 134.4%. The ratio of EAP to cumulative precipitation ranged from 3.0% to 6.9%, increasing significantly in a fluctuating manner. The increments in precipitation days and impervious surface area played a major role in the increase of EAP, and the decrease in precipitation was the fundamental reason for the increase in the proportion of impervious surface evaporation and water resource pressure in the BYD. Excluding the continuous evaporation from the remaining water can likely lead to underestimating the impervious surface evaporation. This study provides an efficient and reasonable novel approach for calculating impervious surface evaporation in long series and large-scale catchments.Using high-resolution impervious surface data to revise 30 m resolution impervious surface data to obtain accurate impervious surface area fraction will improve the estimation accuracy of impervious surface evaporation.Potential evaporation from three types of impervious surfaces (roofs, ground affected or not affected by the building height) was calculated by modifying the parameters of the Penman-Monteith equation, and daily precipitation and water-storage capacity of impervious surfaces were taken into account to estimate impervious surface evaporation.Excluding the continuous evaporation from the remaining water can likely lead to underestimating the impervious surface evaporation.image","Liu, Xiaoyu","Mo, Xingguo","Liu, Suxia","Hu, Shi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,Baiyangdian catchment,impervious surface,impervious surface evaporation,potential evaporation,precipitation,LAND-COVER DATA,WATER-BALANCE,URBAN CLIMATE,MODEL,URBANIZATION,SIMULATION,RUNOFF,IMPACT,ENERGY,VARIABILITY,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2024,Spatiotemporal distribution and influencing factors of impervious surface evaporation in the Baiyangdian catchment from 1980 to 2020

Satellite-based measurements provide a promising approach to estimate groundlevel air pollution on large scale. However, most applications of satellite-based measurements have been used for fine particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide, while only a few have been used for O3. In this study, we incorporated satellite-based measurements from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and MOderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with meteorological variables and land-use data to estimate daily maximum 8-h average O3 at 1-km resolution in Taiwan during 2004-2020. The random forest model was used to impute the missing values of the satellite-based measurements. Additionally, the XGBoost model was leveraged to estimate daily O 3 concentrations. Model performance was evaluated by the ten -fold cross -validation (CV), temporal and spatial validation, and the results were reported as the coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) and root mean square error (RMSE). Our results showed that the 10 -fold CV, temporal validated, and spatial validated R 2 (RMSE) of the XGBoost model were 0.82 (7.71 ppb), 0.63 (11.09 ppb), and 0.68 (10.27 ppb), respectively. Our model performance was better in central and southern Taiwan. The top ten important predictors were date (relative importance = 12.15%), temperature (10.77%), meridional wind (10.71%), relative humidity (9.60%), zonal wind (8.14%), UV radiation (8.07%), total precipitation (6.35%), surface pressure (5.34%), surface O 3 volume mixing ratio (4.93%), and boundary layer height (4.69%). The spatial distribution of O 3 estimates showed that daily maximum 8-h average O 3 concentrations were higher in the suburban and mountainous areas near the central and southern Taiwan. This reveals that sensitive populations should still pay attention to the secondary pollutants even when outside the urban areas. The O 3 estimates can be further leveraged to evaluate the short-term and long-term effects of O 3 on human health.","Jung, Chau-Ren","Chen, Wei","Chen, Wei-Ting","Su, Shih-Hao","Chen, Bo-Ting","Chang, Ling","Hwang, Bing-Fang",,,,,,,,,,,,0,ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT,Aerosol optical depth,Daily maximum 8-h ozone,Extreme gradient boosting model,OMI O 3,Remote sensing,Spatiotemporal estimation model,GROUND-LEVEL OZONE,AIR-POLLUTION,EXPOSURE,TAIWAN,FOREST,EAST,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 15 2024,A machine learning model for estimating daily maximum 8-hour average ozone concentrations using OMI and MODIS products

In order to create a multi-level equivalent 3D digital map based on digital elevation model, it is first necessary to analyze the topographic features and architectural components of the actual geographic environment. Based on this analysis, a 2D connected graph is transformed into a 3D connected graph, which is then transformed into and optimized in 3D. For global path planning in a connected graph, a sparse A* search algorithm with changeable steps based on a step size map is designed, which can effectively reduce the path search time while ensuring the quality of path. For local path planning in connected graphs, a real-time path replanning algorithm using probabilistic roadmap method based on obstacle prediction is proposed to meet the real-time obstacle avoidance requirements of UAVs. The simulation flight is carried out in a mountain scene and an urban scene respectively, the results show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the difficulty of solving 3D path planning and complete the path planning of different scales and requirements in a complex environment in a short time; compared with the 3D A* algorithm and the 2D A* algorithm based on 2D connected graph, global path planning algorithm reduces the search time by 99% and 95% respectively, local path replanning algorithm can complete the path replanning in a single sampling period of 1 s, avoid unknown obstacles in real-time and ensure the safety of the flight process.

It is expected that with climate change, the wildland fire and WUI fire problem will only intensify. Wildland fires are often initiated by small ignition sources caused either by human intervention (hot metal fragments or burning biomass) or by natural events (lighting or sun heating). Once the wildfire or structural fire has been ignited and grows, it can spread rapidly through ember spotting, where pieces of burning materials are lifted by the plume of the fire and then transported forward by the wind, landing where they can start spot fires downwind. The ignition mechanisms for all of these fires have the common characteristic of a small and localized area of origin, with the subsequent spread of the fire to wider and larger areas. Because of the three-dimensional characteristics of this type of propagating fire, its rate of spread has an initial acceleration phase leading to an equilibrium rate of spread when the fire reaches a certain size, which is referred to as a ""line-fire"" type of spread. Most of the studies on wildland fire propagation have been conducted with line fires and have been concerned with characterizing the equilibrium rate of spread rather than the initial spread from a small ignition source. In this paper, some of the studies conducted to date on the subject of wildland fire growth from a small ignition source, and the physics supporting the mathematical expressions that are used to describe the growth of the fire are discussed. An attempt is also made to provide support for these works through a more fundamental approach to model the problem.","Thomsen, M.","Fernandez-Pello, A. C.","Williams, F.

However, mapping construction changes at a medium scale (i.e., 30 m) using satellite time series and deep learning models presents challenges due to their large spectral variability during different phases of construction and the presence of small and isolated change targets. These challenges reduce the effectiveness of feature extraction from deep convolutional layers. To address these issues, we propose a novel Classify Areas with Potential and then Exclude the Stable pixels (hereafter called CAPES) method using a U-net model along with perpixel-based time series model information derived from the COntinuous monitoring of Land Disturbance (COLD) algorithm (Zhu et al., 2020).

Given the importance of ecology within the WEF system, water resources serve as the core issue. The allocation of water resources in irrigation districts is a challenging problem for the coordinated development of agricultural production, water resources, and the ecological environment. The integration of stochastic multiobjective programming, fuzzy credibility-constrained programming, and mixed integer programming offers a solution to this issue, with the construction of a fuzzy credibility-constrained stochastic multi-objective mixedinteger nonlinear programming model. The applicability and validity of this model were verified by applying it to the Kaikong Irrigation District (KID) of the Tarim River Basin in northwest China, with notable findings indicating that the optimized system reduces agricultural costs by 5.82%, increases irrigation water use efficiency by 1.80%, and reduces global warming potential by 6.45%. This study investigates the effects of diverse allocation strategies of water and land resources on the social, economic, and ecological subsystems and their interactions by downscaling four subprocesses PBs to the KID scale.

However, pollution control policies have generally neglected or simplified the impacts of soil NOX emissions in rural regions. This study aims to evaluate the effect of soil NOX emissions on O-3 in agricultural areas of China based on high-resolution soil NOX emission inventory and the WRF-Chem air quality model. We first validate the simulation result of the O-3 concentration with surface O-3 observations over China using the selected optimal physicochemical scheme. After that, four scenarios are designed to simulate and analyze the regional sensitivity of O-3 to soil NOX emissions and to quantify the effect of soil NOX emissions on O-3 concentration. The results indicate that as soil NOX emissions increase, the overall spatial pattern does not change notably over mainland China, but the O-3 concentration increases remarkably in the northwest and northeast of China. Additionally, we discover that changes of O-3 concentration across mainland China differ substantially among regions. Our results highlight the effect of soil NOX emissions on air quality in agricultural areas.

Row_425,"The spatial distribution of black carbon (BC) concentrations was highly variable across different underlying surfaces. Differences in meteorological conditions and emission sources led to great temporal and spatial variations in BC characteristics. As the most important absorbing aerosol, BC can affect radiation, clouds, and surface snow. BC mass concentrations were measured using a seven channel aethalometer (AE-33) in the Urumqi and Taklimakan Deserts from January to December 2022. The aethalometer data, potential source contribution function (PSCF), and concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) models were used to analyse the variation characteristics, potential sources, and affected areas. Results showed that the BC concentrations in the Taklamakan Desert and Urumqi were in the range of 0-500 ngm(-3), accounting for 66.20 % and 59.50 % of the total, respectively. The backward trajectory simulation of BC mass concentration in the tower and Urumqi using the HYSPLIT model found that the airflow trajectories in the tower in summer corresponded to the BC concentration in the following order: trajectory 4 > trajectory 3 > trajectory 2 > trajectory 1, and trajectory 4 originated from the Turpan airflow accounting for 46.19 % of the total, which corresponded to the highest BC concentration of 621.73 ngm(-3). The trajectories of the airflow in Urumqi in summer corresponded to the BC concentration in the order of high to low, and the BC concentration in summer corresponded to the highest concentration in the Turpan airflow.

Row_426,"As part of ecosystem services, cultural ecosystem services (CES) have important implications for human wellbeing and social development. Investigating the alignment between the supply of natural ecosystem services (NES) and the demand for CES, along with the distribution of CES demand clusters, is crucial for promoting sustainable development and improving ecosystem conservation and management. By revealing the degree of match between NES supply and CES demand and the distribution of CES demand clusters across different regions, this study provides a scientific evidence for governments to formulate regional development strategies, resource allocation, and public service provision. This study examined the match between NES supply and CES demand and identify clusters of CES demand from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives, using a comprehensive analytical approach that combines points of interest (POI) data and the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model. Focusing on China as the study area enables an in-depth exploration of the impact of its unique cultural background and regional differences on the alignment between NES supply and CES demand, offering insights into policy-making in China and other similar regions. The findings indicated the following. (1) There were significant geographical disparities and imbalances in the match of NES supply and CES demand across China. Compared with 2013-2017, the spatial extent of low supply-high demand and high supply-low demand increased from 2018 to 2022. (2) The demand clusters exhibited clear distribution characteristics. The distribution of the CES demand clusters in China exhibits distinct geographical characteristics. Entertainment demand (V1) was mainly distributed in the northwest and southwest parts of China, and Aesthetic education and culture demand (V2) was mainly distributed in the northeast, east, central, and southern parts of China. Culture and entertainment demand (V3) was mainly distributed in the northern, northwestern, southwestern, central, and southern parts of China. Compared with 2013-2017, the spatial distribution of clusters V1 and V2 showed little change from 2018 to 2022, whereas the V3 clusters showed a significant decrease in southern and central China and a more concentrated distribution in northern, northwestern, and southwestern China. This study thoroughly investigated the issues of matching NES supply with CES demand and the distribution of CES demand clusters in China, offering scientific evidence for government policy formulation through CES studies. It revealed the connections between ecosystems and culture and provides valuable lessons and experiences for sustainable development, ecological preservation, and cultural heritage in other regions worldwide.

Row_427,"Planting low-pollen trees could reduce aeroallergen exposure in cities, but the effects of historical tree planting on contemporary airborne pollen exposure remains largely unexplored. Whether tree selection decisions can effectively reduce airborne pollen will depend in part on which taxa are the most important sources of allergenic pollen and the extent to which they are intentionally planted vs. unplanted (i.e., recruiting naturally). Here, we use airborne pollen measurements to examine which taxa are of allergenic importance in New York City (NYC), and then combine two tree surveys with allometric equations to determine pollen production for several taxa. Future changes in pollen production as a function of growth, mortality, and recruitment are then simulated using i-Tree Eco Forecast. The most important producers of allergenic pollen in NYC are Quercus, Platanus, Morus, and Betula; they comprise 71% of airborne pollen measured and 93% of estimated pollen production (107 quadrillion pollen grains; however, pollen production was not estimated for all taxa). Previous municipal planting decisions have resulted in the high abundance of Platanus x acerifolia; it accounts for 34% of total street tree basal area and has an estimated annual pollen production of 27.7 +/- 6.4 quadrillion grains. In contrast, Morus and Betula are generally unplanted, indicating that tree planting decisions will have smaller effects on their future pollen production rates in NYC. Quercus trees produced an estimated 68.2 +/- 12.3 quadrillion pollen grains and accounted for almost 25% of airborne pollen collected, but were very abundant in parks and were mostly unplanted, suggesting that planting has not and will not have a major effect on city-wide pollen production. Overall, this study demonstrates that tree planting decisions can have important and long-lasting consequences for city-wide pollen production but only for species that are both primarily planted and large producers of allergenic pollen.","Katz, Daniel S.

Row_428,"Temperature extremes over rapidly urbanizing regions with high population densities have been scrutinized due to their severe impacts on human safety and economics. First of all, the performance of the regional climate model RegCM4 with a hydrostatic or non-hydrostatic dynamic core in simulating seasonal temperature and temperature extremes was evaluated over the historical period of 1991-99 at a 12-km spatial resolution over China and a 3-km resolution over the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (JJJ) region, a typical urban agglomeration of China. Simulations of spatial distributions of temperature extremes over the JJJ region using RegCM4 with hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic cores showed high spatial correlations of more than 0.8 with the observations. Under a warming climate, temperature extremes of annual maximum daily temperature (TXx) and summer days (SU) in China and the JJJ region showed obvious increases by the end of the 21st century while there was a general reduction in frost days (FD). The ensemble of RegCM4 with different land surface components was used to examine population exposure to temperature extremes over the JJJ region. Population exposure to temperature extremes was found to decrease in 2091-99 relative to 1991-99 over the majority of the JJJ region due to the joint impacts of increases in temperature extremes over the JJJ and population decreases over the JJJ region, except for downtown areas. Furthermore, changes in population exposure to temperature extremes were mainly dominated by future population changes. Finally, we quantified changes in exposure to temperature extremes with temperature increase over the JJJ region. This study helps to provide relevant policies to respond future climate risks over the JJJ region.(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic), (sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic), (sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic).

Row_429,"Retrievals of satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) products are used for studies of air pollution, energy balance, and climate change. However, few studies have evaluated the diurnal time representation (DTR) of satellite AOD products. In this study, we proposed a statistically valid threshold method to investigate the DTR of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR), and Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) AOD products by comparing their retrievals to the daily AERONET AOD values and explored the ability of AHI and AERONET to capture daily aerosol variability at 54 sites in Asia and Oceania from July 2015 to December 2019. For polar-orbiting satellites, based on collocations with AERONET measurements, MISR-derived AOD showed high consistency with daily average AERONET AOD, with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.94 and 80.85% matchups falling into the envelopes of expected error (EE, +/- (0.05 + 0.15 x AODAERONET)). Compared with single MODIS products, a combination of satellite data from the Terra and Aqua MODIS dark target (DT) algorithm might obtain a dataset with better DTR (R = 0.94 and %Within EE = 72.10). The satellite-retrieved AOD did a good job to represent the daily mean AERONET AOD, because AERONET AOD averaged within a +/- 30 min time window of different satellite overpasses closely mirrored the daily mean AERONET AOD. Furthermore, the seasonal average diurnal variations (SADV) of AERONET AOD were changing insignificant, except for the urban coverage area in the Southern Hemisphere and equatorial climate. For geostationary satellite, the DTR of AHI was relatively poorer in comparison to the other sensors (R = 0.84, %Within EE = 58.00), and AHI AOD was seriously underestimated in South Asia and overestimated in Oceania. Besides, the SADVs of AHI AOD presented several patterns summarized as wave type, unimodal type, stable fluctuation type, and other types, which meant that AHI AOD retrievals did not accurately capture the diurnal variability of aerosols. This study provides a reference for the aerosol community to select satellite AOD products with appropriate DTR.","Yang, Zhiyong","Zhang, Ming","Wang, Lunche","Su, Xin","Qin, Wenmin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT,Aerosol optical depth,MOIDS,VIIRS,MISR,AHI,Diurnal time representation,Aerosol daily variation,AEROSOL OPTICAL DEPTH,IMAGING SPECTRORADIOMETER MISR,LEVEL PM2.5 CONCENTRATIONS,GLOBAL VALIDATION,DATA ASSIMILATION,NORTH CHINA,NPP VIIRS,AERONET,RETRIEVAL,LAND,,,,,,,,,DEC 15 2023,"Diurnal time representation of MODIS, VIIRS, MISR, and AHI over Asia and Oceania"
Row_430,"Climate change, rapid increase in population, and urbanization have given rise to over-exploitation and shortage of freshwater resources. Acquiring accurate representations of fresh water availability is therefore crucial to sustainable development. Based on the underlying hydrological processes and storage types, fresh water can be divided into blue and green water components. Hence, quantification of the spatio-temporal distribution of blue and green water requires estimating the components of terrestrial water cycle. In this study, a framework is proposed to evaluate the water scarcity using the blue and green water concept. In this framework, the Wageningen Institute and Research (WUR) version of the Variable Infiltration Capacity Model (VIC) is employed to simulate terrestrial water cycle. Compared to VIC model, VIC-WUR model employs additional modules to account for sectoral water demands, return flows, and groundwater withdrawals, however, very limited number of its applications have been reported so far. The Divandareh-Bijar (DBJ) basin in west of Iran is selected because it has experienced severe anthropogenic alterations in the past three decades. To address precipitation and parameter uncertainty, the VIC-WUR model is separately calibrated for three precipitation datasets. As a part of this framework, the calibrated model is used to simulate blue and green water components and their corresponding scarcity metrics for the first time. According to the results, blue and green water resources in the DBJ are relatively scarce. The results also highlight the importance of considering anthropogenic impacts on the spatiotemporal dynamics of green and blue water resources. Additionally, quantification of the uncertainty in blue and green water components can help produce more reliable estimations for intelligent management of water resources. The ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA) method is therefore used to quantify the contribution of three major factors, including precipitation inputs, model parameters, and the interaction of these two, on the uncertainty of calculated water scarcity metrics. Structural uncertainty is implicitly addressed through the use of the modified version of the VIC model. The results indicate seasonality of these contributions for the two metrics under investigation and the differences in relative contribution of different sources to the overall uncertainty. The proposed framework could be employed to identify water stress in various spatiotemporal scales across the globe.","Sohi, Hossein Yousefi","Zahraie, Banafsheh","Dolatabadi, Neda","Zebarjadian, Faezeh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,VIC-WUR model,Uncertainty,Water scarcity,Blue water,Green water,ANOVA,REGIONAL-SCALE HYDROLOGY,LAND-SURFACE WATER,CLIMATE-CHANGE,PART 1,UNCERTAINTY SOURCES,DATA ASSIMILATION,SOIL-MOISTURE,RIVER-BASINS,BLUE WATER,PRECIPITATION,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2024,Application of VIC-WUR model for assessing the spatiotemporal distribution of water availability in anthropogenically-impacted basins
Row_431,"Groundwater storage and depletion fluctuations in response to groundwater availability for irrigation require understanding on a local scale to ensure a reliable groundwater supply. However, the coarser spatial resolution and intermittent data gaps to estimate the regional groundwater storage anomalies (GWSA) prevent the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On (GARCE-FO) mission from being applied at the local scale. To enhance the resolution of GWSA measurements using machine learning approaches, numerous recent efforts have been made. With a focus on the development of a new algorithm, this study enhanced the GWSA resolution estimates to 0.05 degrees by extensively investigating the continuous spatiotemporal variations of GWSA based on the regional downscaling approach using a regression algorithm known as the geographically weighted regression model (GWR). First, the modified seasonal decomposition LOESS method (STL) was used to estimate the continuous terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA). Secondly, to separate GWSA from TWSA, a water balance equation was used. Third, the continuous GWSA was downscaled to 0.05 degrees based on the GWR model. Finally, spatio-temporal properties of downscaled GWSA were investigated in the North China Plain (NCP), China's fastest-urbanizing area, from 2003 to 2022. The results of the downscaled GWSA were spatially compatible with GRACE-derived GWSA. The downscaled GWSA results are validated (R = 0.83) using in-situ groundwater level data. The total loss of GWSA in cities of the NCP fluctuated between 2003 and 2022, with the largest loss seen in Handan (-15.21 +/- 7.25 mm/yr), Xingtai (-14.98 +/- 7.25 mm/yr), and Shijiazhuang ( 14.58 +/- 7.25 mm/yr). The irrigated winter-wheat farming strategy is linked to greater groundwater depletion in several cities of NCP (e.g., Xingtai, Handan, Anyang, Hebi, Puyang, and Xinxiang). The study's high-resolution findings can help with understanding local groundwater depletion that takes agricultural water utilization and provide quantitative data for water management.","Ali, Shoaib","Ran, Jiangjun","Luan, Yi","Khorrami, Behnam","Xiao, Yun","Tangdamrongsub, Natthachet",,,,,,,,,,,,,14,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,North China Plain,GRACE,GWSA,STL,GWR,Downscaling,DATA ASSIMILATION,RIVER-BASIN,GRACE DATA,CLIMATE-CHANGE,LAND,EVAPOTRANSPIRATION,REGRESSION,DEPLETION,RECHARGE,IMPACTS,,,,,,,,,,JAN 15 2024,The GWR model-based regional downscaling of GRACE/GRACE-FO derived groundwater storage to investigate local-scale variations in the North China Plain
Row_432,"Ecosystem health in the Yangtze River basin (YRB) shows significant regional differences. Analysis of regional differences and drivers of ecosystem health in YRB is of practical significance for sustainable basin ecological management. However, existing studies lack research on regional differences and driving forces of ecosystem health, especially in big basin regions. Based on multi-source data, this study adopted spatial statistics and distribution dynamics models to quantitatively analyze the regional differences of ecosystem health in the YRB during 2000-2020 and employed the spatial panel model to reveal the driving forces of ecosystem health in the YRB. The ecosystem health index of the upper, middle, and lower reaches of YRB and the entire basin in 2020 was 0.753, 0.781, 0.637, and 0.742, respectively, while they all decreased during 2000- 2020. Regional differences in YRB ecosystem health increased during 2000-2020. From the perspective of dynamic evolution, low-level and high-level ecosystem health units evolved to high-level, while medium-high-level ecosystem health units evolved to low-level. High-high ( accounting for 30.372% in 2020) and low-low (accounting for 13.533% in 2020) were the main cluster types. Regression result showed that urbanization was the main reason for ecosystem health deterioration. The findings can provide enlightenment to further understand the regional differences of ecosystem health in YRB and provide theoretical reference for the coordinated management of ecosystem at macro-level and the differential regulation of local ecosystem at micro-level in the basin region.","Yang, Liyan","Chen, Wanxu","Zeng, Jie","Pan, Sipei","Zhong, Yangyi","Gu, Tianci",,,,,,,,,,,,,14,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,Ecosystem health,Regional differences,Driving forces,Distribution dynamics,Spatial analysis,Yangtze River Basin,LAND-USE CHANGES,SOCIOECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT,URBAN-GROWTH,PATTERNS,SERVICES,URBANIZATION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2023,"Regional differences and driving forces of ecosystem health in Yangtze River Basin, China"
