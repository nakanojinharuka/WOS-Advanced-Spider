Row_1,"Healthcare accessibility and equality have attracted extensive attention, but few in metropolitan areas, which are characterized by intense intercity connections. Despite of the policy focus on intercity patient mobility in metropolitan areas, the quantitative impact of intercity patient mobility on healthcare accessibility and equality remains understudied. This study develops a comprehensive framework to quantify such impacts by comparing two scenarios (i.e., intercity and intracity) of accessibility to existing and optimized healthcare services. A twostep optimization method, integrating efficiency and equality, is applied to optimize healthcare resources. These analyses are conducted within the context of the Shenzhen metropolitan area. The results reveal that intercity patient mobility can improve efficiency and equality of healthcare accessibility to existing services by 8% and 6%, respectively. Furthermore, optimization that considers intercity patient mobility can improve healthcare accessibility efficiency and equality by 37% and 19% compared to the status quo. The framework and methods developed in this study are valuable for measuring and optimizing healthcare accessibility in metropolitan areas, which is transferrable to other areas with significant regional disparity. This study also provides quantitative evidence of the positive effects of intercity patient mobility on healthcare efficiency and equality in metropolitan areas, which is fundamental for policymaking and planning.","Zhong, Qianyu","Wu, Jiangyue","Tao, Zhuolin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,APPLIED GEOGRAPHY,Healthcare accessibility,Intercity patient mobility,Equality,Efficiency,Metropolitan area,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,"Intercity patient mobility can improve healthcare accessibility and equality in metropolitan areas: A case study of Shenzhen metropolitan area, China"
Row_2,"This study examines the effects of residential areas and regional characteristics on household income mobility in Korea using a dynamic ordered probit model. The results demonstrate that households located in metropolitan areas are more likely to belong to the higher income quintile compared with households located in non-metropolitan areas. However, population growth in non-metropolitan areas was confirmed to have a positive effect on upward mobility associated with household income, while population growth in the metropolitan area negatively affected upward mobility. The findings support the legitimacy of the population distribution policy, which implies the need for the government to pursue a regionally balanced development policy more vigorously.","Yoon, Sung-Joo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS,Household income mobility,residential area,income quintiles,dynamic ordered probit model,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 14 2024,Household income mobility in metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas in Korea

The exploration of the spaces of activity of metropolitan residents is essential for the understanding urban expansion processes. This paper aims to evaluate the spaces of activity of metropolitan residents through a methodological proposal that combines the analysis of patterns of daily mobility, identified from personal tracking data, and the exploitation of land-use cartography. The method has been applied to the spatial extension of the daily life of members of the Autonomous University of Barcelona.

Row_4,"In an urbanized world, the challenges posed by climate change need to be met through innovative planning for cities and regions. Urban resilience demands that cities adopt new models centered on carbon neutrality, ecosystem services and biodiversity enhancement, circularity, and social inclusion. In light of the multiple interdependencies of metropolitan systems and the natural and territorial potentialities present on their fringes, this paper discusses the metropolitan fringes as strategic for urban resilience and sustainable transitions. By combining a mixed-method analysis of adaptation and urban plans with semi-structured interviews performed with key technicians, the analysis is focused on an inter-municipal fringe zone within the Barcelona Metropolitan Area - the Bes`os territory. Aiming to contribute to the discussions related to Territorial innovation for cities and regions, the paper offers a multi-scale perspective and illustrates innovative urban transformation strategies across scales. The results highlight that governance and multiple planning and participation instances together with technical and financial support are essential for consensus building in an incremental process. Furthermore, the planning strategies of the case study sought to integrate and enhance the green and blue infrastructures and transform consolidated urban areas with a focus on energy transition, sustainable mobility, circularity, and social inclusion. In conclusion, it is argued that resilience has a multi-scalar perspective within the metropolitan context and should be integrated with planning policies at different scales from a coordinated vision. Although adaptation and urban projects have a critical local element, a broader and more strategic vision is necessary, especially in metropolitan fringe areas.","Marques, Andresa Ledo","Alvim, Angelica Tanus Benatti",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,CITIES,Metropolitan fringes,Urban resilience,Metropolitan resilience,Metropolitan planning,Multi-scale planning,Barcelona Metropolitan Area,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2024,Metropolitan fringes as strategic areas for urban resilience and sustainable transitions: Insights from Barcelona Metropolitan Area
Row_5,"This article deals with mobility planning and intervention initiatives carried out in the last decade in one of the intermediate cities of Argentina: the Mendoza Metropolitan Area. These initiatives are framed in the principles of sustainable mobility and try to solve the problems posed by intensive automobile mobility and the growth in extension of cities. Here we focus on the dissemination of models for the implementation of these initiatives, on the circulation of these models between different cities and on the actors involved. We dwell on the implementation of the so-called mass public transport systems, particularly on the Metrotranvia for the Mendoza Metropolitan Area. We develop a qualitative methodological strategy that combines various techniques and instruments for the construction and analysis of data from primary and secondary sources, such as documentary analysis, interviews, photography and field observation. In general, we observe that the application of these models does not guarantee the achievement of the objectives of sustainable mobility, for which we consider the active role of those who promote it to be essential for its application in various cities.","Magallanes, Rodrigo Martin","Navarrete, Maria Jose","Dalla Torre, Julieta",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,REVISTA DE TRANSPORTE Y TERRITORIO,SUSTAINABLE MOBILITY,POLICY CIRCULATION,URBAN PLANIFICATION,URBAN PUBLIC TRANSPORT,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN-JUN 2024,"Challenges for sustainable mobility: the development of mobility policies in the Mendoza Metropolitan Area, Argentina"
Row_6,"Environmentally friendly alternatives to motorised transport have recently become a topic of discussion among political representatives. To achieve sustainable urban mobility objectives, political discussions have focused on promoting cycling, walking and using public transport in cities. These modes of transportation are attractive ways of commuting to and from work for a portion of the population. In the literature, there is a growing interest in the phenomenon of active commuting. This paper examines the spatio-temporal patterns and practices of active commuting and evaluates their significance in the context of sustainable urban mobility. The empirical research is based on data obtained from a questionnaire survey and semistructured interviews conducted in 2023 in the Brno Metropolitan Area. Based on the data, three categories of active commuting were identified, namely pragmatic active commuting, physical active commuting, and combined active commuting, which differ in the implementation of different spatio-temporal practices. For the development of sustainable transport in the city, it is necessary to promote the construction of pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure, with the aim of making movement for pedestrians and cyclists more straightforward, efficient, and safer, including paying attention to actions leading to the embedding of this mode of transport in the wider societal context.","Gorny, David",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,MORAVIAN GEOGRAPHICAL REPORTS,Active commuting,spatio-temporal practices,urban mobility,transport mode,Brno Metropolitan Area,physical activity,,,,,,,,,,SEP 1 2024,Active commuting as a form of sustainable urban mobility: The case of the Brno Metropolitan Area
Row_7,"This paper verifies the determinants on an intra-district residential mobility pattern with the residential migration theory. By using the intradistrict residential mobility to mobility ratio, we examine the patterns based on the variables of household attributes, degree of affordability, housing quality, and place identity. The overall results show that there are significant effects in the metropolitan area. Furthermore, the effects of household attributes and housing quality exhibit a declining pattern from the central business district to the fringe areas, and place identity is crucial to the fringe areas, but insignificant in the central business district (CBD). As for the district time-invariant effect, the fringe areas have higher values than the CBD, and in the case of the time-series effect, it appears that the CBD has a higher value than those in the fringe areas. Thus, we conclude that the residents in the central areas have a negative place identity but are highly affected by the household attributes and housing quality. However, the mobility patterns in the fringe areas show the opposite result. They are more influenced by a positive place identity but less affected by the household attributes and housing quality. Finally, housing affordability has a significant impact for all.","Chen, Ping-Hung","Peng, Chien-Wen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,INTERNATIONAL REAL ESTATE REVIEW,Residential Mobility,Housing Affordability,Housing Quality,Household Attributes,Place Identity,Panel Data,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2024,Determinants of Intra-District Residential Mobility - A Case Study of Taipei Metropolitan Area
Row_8,"This research examines transit effectiveness empirically through the lens of access to employment. The approach uses the gradual shift of mobility to access to introduce the Transit-Walk Access Gap (TWAG) as an effectiveness indicator. TWAG is evaluated in the 50 most populated American Metropolitan Areas, and the analyses offer three conclusions. First, transit access effectiveness should not be measured in isolation of spatial and temporal dimensions of the transit service. The results show that transit service is slightly effective in short travel times, but a gradual improvement in transit access effectiveness is noticed by increased travel-time thresholds. Results also indicate that the spatial coverage of effective transit rises with an increase in travel time. However, the nature of the relationship does not appear to be linear. Second, transit access effectiveness is Central Business District (CBD) centric in most American metropolitan areas. The correlation analysis declares that transit access effectiveness declines from a surfeit of effectiveness to relative scarcity as one moves out from the center. It is realized that the correlation becomes more substantial with an increase in the travel-time threshold. Third, transit access effectiveness is positively correlated with transit ridership. The magnitude of association is a function of the metropolitan area and the travel-time threshold, with Memphis as the most elastic and New York the least elastic metropolitan area. The transit access effectiveness indicator introduced here should not be viewed as final. As transit access data are becoming increasingly available and as the goal of transport is shifting from mobility to access, further research needs to be conducted to advance the understanding of access-related transit effectiveness. The adoption of the indicator is, ultimately, a political process.","Ermagun, Alireza","Witlox, Frank",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Accessibility,Public transit,Transit service area,Transit performance,Transit effectiveness,,,,,,,,,,,APR 2024,Transit access effectiveness in American metropolitan areas
Row_9,"The suburbanization of poverty has been a concerning trend in many urban regions. While research has described patterns of suburbanization of poverty at regional and neighbourhood levels, there are open questions about how lower -income households have agglomerated in the suburbs in recent history. Is suburban poverty primarily a result of 1) the movement of low-income residents from central to suburban neighbourhoods (e.g., via processes of gentrification and displacement), 2) migration between Census Metropolitan Areas and the immigration of low-income groups to suburbs, or 3) becoming and remaining poor while staying in the suburbs? The objective of this paper is to describe and quantify the propensity of these predominant individual geographic pathways to suburban poverty. We do so via a cluster analysis of census and land use data to define neighbourhoods as either central or suburban, and then link this categorization to a large-scale panel dataset representing 20 % of tax filers in Canada (from 2006 to 2016). These data allow for analyzing different pathways within the context of large Canadian metropolitan areas, specifically to what extent poverty in suburban neighbourhoods stems from intraurban residential mobility, immigration, and becoming poor in -place. We find that becoming and remaining poor while staying in the suburbs encompasses a greater proportion of suburban poverty than immigration and centreto -suburb residential mobility combined. Overall, this research expands our understanding of the sources of suburban poverty while also providing pertinent information to aid preventative policy aimed at reducing suburban poverty in Canada.","Allen, Jeff","Farber, Steven","Tiznado-Aitken, Ignacio",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,CITIES,Suburbs,Poverty,Residential mobility,Immigration,Panel data,,,,,,,,,,,APR 2024,Pathways to suburban poverty in nine Canadian metropolitan areas

The study aimed to comprehend the aspirations and potential trends of residential mobility in this population segment, to provide insights for the development of public policies. To achieve these objectives, secondary data, reflective approaches through fieldwork, and the application of qualitative instruments were utilized, made possible by the composition of a multidisciplinary team. These instruments were applied in areas with high concentrations of poverty, based on income and housing conditions, to establish a reflection on residential mobility, its modifications, and relationships, measured by family living standards, types of households, and income.

Row_11,"Examining medical supply-demand imbalances, as revealed through patients' cross-boundary treatment behaviors, is vital for reducing a metropolitan area's medical supply-demand gap and furthering sustainable development goals. This study, leveraging medical supply-demand and commuting data, scrutinizes medical imbalances in the Wuhan metropolitan area core. It includes a 'People-centered' theory for elucidating patients' treatment behaviors, proposes a method for constructing a regional medical supply-demand network, and explores the problem of supply-demand imbalance. The key findings include: (1) Wuhan's central area, despite its abundance of quality medical resources, fails to adequately cover the entire metropolitan area, indicating a need for broader resource distribution. (2) The Ezhou-Huangshi-Huanggang junction shows a stark contrast to Wuhan with its limited medical services and extensive hinterland connections. Future initiatives should aim to integrate resources dispersed from Wuhan, reducing regional disparities. (3) The city's periphery, influenced by resource distribution models and geographic distance, exhibits significant variance from central urban areas in medical supply-demand connectivity, particularly around Wuhan's eastern administrative boundaries. Future urban planning is needed to reinforce this area's role as a vital medical services conduit.

Row_13,"In Indonesia, issues in the metropolitan transportation sector are considered severe. For instance, peripheral districts in the Jakarta metropolitan area (JMA), such as Bogor, Depok, Tangerang and Bekasi, contribute to the high mobility rate within the metropolitan area. This article examines the extent of motorcycle-based ridehailing for commuting in the JMA and Bandung metropolitan areas (BMA). In particular, this study explores ridehailing users' characteristics-social, economic and spatial-and their proportion to the total commuter mobility in a metropolitan area. The study employed descriptive statistical models using commuter data in the JMA and BMA, respectively. Our results indicate that young and lower-income commuters are the dominant users of ridehailing services. As motorcycle taxi services are relatively cheaper and accessible, young and lower-income commuters, including informal workers, prefer ride-hailing services. The study also suggests the impact of the intensification of inter-peri-urban mobilities of post-suburbanisation on the increasing demand for ride-hailing. In this sense, the study proposes that the long-overdue strengthening of metropolitan-scale governance is urgently required. It is also crucial for metropolitan governments to issue appropriate inter-district public transportation policies and engage in development.","Aritenang, Adiwan Fahlan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION,Motorcycle-based ride-hailing,Metropolitan,Commuters,Sharing economy,Indonesia,,,,,,,,,,,2024,The crucial role of motorcycle-based ride-hailing among commuters: The case of Jakarta and Bandung metropolitan areas
Row_14,"With the rapid development of high-speed railways (HSR) in China, the level of travel accessibility for residents has improved. While previous research has predominantly concentrated on the accessibility of HSR networks, it is imperative to recognize that the accessibility of HSR services is intrinsically intertwined with the spatial arrangement of HSR stations. The unreasonable location of HSR stations can lead to inequitable problems in service facilities within metropolitan areas. When investigating the accessibility of HSR stations, the road network emerges as the primary conduit for residents' mobility. The spatial variance of the road network manifests not only in divergent spatial densities but also in the traffic conditions across distinct temporal and spatial intervals. Based on the road network and dynamic road conditions, this study proposed a modified two-step floating catchment area method (M2SFCA) by using high-speed railway station location data, the subdistrict office (village and town) data, road network data, and floating car data (FCD). Taking the XZQ Metropolitan Core Area (the metropolitan core area of Xiamen, Zhangzhou, and Quanzhou, China) as an example, this paper analyzed the impact of a newly planned HSR station on the spatial distribution of accessibility in the metropolitan core area. The findings revealed that the newly planned HSR station has led to a substantial 68.18% elevation in overall regional accessibility. Notably, approximately 35% of the population has transitioned from locales with diminished accessibility to regions with heightened accessibility. Furthermore, the HSR station has ameliorated the hitherto uneven spatial distribution of accessibility advantages across the region. Under the limitation of travel time in metropolitan areas, this study explored an accessibility evaluation model based on dynamic traffic data, providing a method for an impartial and equitable evaluation of transportation infrastructure placement within the metropolitan core area.This study shows that the new high-speed railway station will not only improve regional accessibility but also affect the equilibrium degree of the spatial distribution of regional accessibility benefits. It is suggested that the metropolitan area should further build high-grade roads, strengthen transportation network links between urban areas, and improve regional accessibility. At the same time, for areas where the degree of accessibility fairness has declined, it is suggested to increase the energy level and scale of their high-speed railway stations to reduce the dependence of local residents on external high-speed railway stations and improve the convenience of local residents' travel. In addition, this paper improves the accessibility measurement method-2SFCA method. By improving the search carrier of the spatial action domain, the calculation method of road traffic state, and the selection of time threshold, the improved 2SFCA method is more in line with the actual situation, which expands the dynamic space-time analysis ability, improves the accuracy of accessibility calculation, and can more accurately judge the fairness of high-speed railway station construction.","Gao, Yueer","Kan, Xiaoxi","Cheng, Jing","Zheng, Si","Chen, Meiwen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT,New high-speed railway (HSR) station,Accessibility,Modified two-step floating catchment area method,Floating car data,Metropolitan area,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 1 2024,Accessibility Evaluation of a Newly Planned High-Speed Railway Station in a Metropolitan Core Area Based on a Modified Two-Step Floating Catchment Area Method

In this paper, we explore to what extent new digital mobility solutions can be considered inclusive, by taking into account the diverse perspectives of the users of transport services. Specifically, our work contributes to understanding the end user needs and capabilities in digital mobility, by presenting a set of personas developed using data from a population-representative survey of 601 Barcelona metropolitan area residents in the framework of the EU Horizon 2020 programme's DIGNITY project. Overall, roughly 15% of this population cannot access and effectively use digital technologies, thereby hindering their use of many digital mobility services. This work provides information about the diversity of potential users by analysing different stories and travel experiences of the personas; this in turn can inspire decision makers, developers, and other stakeholders along the design process. The methodological approach for developing personas could be also potentially useful for mobility service providers and policymakers who aim to create more inclusive and user-centred transport ecosystems that meet the needs of diverse users.","Wybraniec, Bartosz","Roca, Elisabet","Ortego, M.

We investigate whether gentrification correlates with increased out-migration and decreased in-migration of low-income residents in affected neighbourhoods, and how it shapes where out-movers relocate. We leverage a unique longitudinal dataset to compare two extreme regional contexts characterised by significant affordability challenges and intense housing regulations. By doing so, this study aims to provide a more refined understanding of gentrification and residential mobility dynamics, avoiding broad generalisations or a narrow focus on single metropolitan contexts. The findings indicate that in both regions, low-income households are indeed more likely to leave gentrifying neighbourhoods compared to non-gentrifying ones and less likely to enter them compared to higher-income households. The study also finds mixed results regarding the subsequent residential situations of these low-income movers.

Row_18,"This article analyzes the service distribution imbalance within the Metropolitan District of Quito (DMQ) and its impact on urban mobility, aiming to propose strategies for more equitable territorial planning. The data were gathered from sources such as the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INEC), the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education, and OpenStreetMap. These data were integrated with GIS tools to model patterns of accessibility and mobility. Through a comprehensive approach, the study assessed education, banking services, employment, and healthcare, identifying how inequitable access to these services drives increased travel demand, especially in rural and peri-urban areas. In the education field, over 500 neighborhoods faced a shortage of institutions, compelling students to commute to other neighborhoods. For financial services, only 67% of neighborhoods had adequate access, with disparities across different socioeconomic zones. Additionally, employment-related mobility posed another challenge, with 88% of workers commuting outside their residential parish. Finally, access to healthcare was also unequal across the DMQ, particularly in peripheral areas where residents must travel long distances. In this context, it can be concluded that more efficient urban planning in the Metropolitan District of Quito (DMQ) is crucial to address imbalances in the distribution of services and enhance quality of life. Proposed strategies include establishing a land reserve, decentralizing services to underserved areas, integrating smart technologies, and promoting incentives for remote work, sustainable mobility, and public transport.

Amidst increasing pressure for more high-density metropolitan areas (HDMAs), international advocacy agencies are calling for policy makers and service providers to ensure good quality urban green spaces (UGSs) for all children. Furthermore, these green spaces need to be purposefully designed to cater to children's needs, which continue to evolve amidst extreme weather such as heat waves. Recently, pandemics have placed additional constraints on how far children can travel and their time spent outdoors, making the quality of this experience for children even more important. This systematic literature review explored the roles of HDMA-UGSs for children during pandemics. From 551 studies retrieved and curated using the PRISMA methodology, 40 papers were subsequently thematically analysed. Four roles were synthesised for HDMA-UGSs in supporting children's experiences during pandemics, which also benefit children during 'normal' day-to-day life': (1) sustaining growth and development, (2) bridging social stratifications, (3) encouraging self-agency, and (4) facilitating independent mobility. Thirteen principles were distilled to support decision making in enabling these outcomes in new-build and refurbishment projects.

Row_21,"Understanding, visualizing, and quantifying how resources are allocated and the fairness of distributions and access is significant for supporting decision-makers in incentivizing development and ensuring that future changes are widely beneficial and fair. By pointing out the need for mobility justice research to shift from statecentric to more society-centric frameworks and metrics, this study proposed a Mobility Justice Framework that integrated two important theories of justice: distribution and recognition justice. The proposed framework highlights the distribution of amenities and burdens in providing transport infrastructure. It also aims to identify those disadvantaged socio-economic groups more exposed to mobility inequalities. To make the framework applicable within the city context and guide decision-making, several metrics (variables) were identified to make principles of distributive and recognition justice operationalizable. Variables such as 1) accessibility by walking, 2) exposure to traffic negative effects, 3) frequency of use of transport modes, and 4) availability of transport infrastructure were used to identify neighborhoods and the different types of mobility resources/burdens that disadvantaged socio-economic groups are exposed to. To showcase its usability, the framework and methodology have been applied to the city of Munich to highlight neighborhoods with a higher proportion of older people and the transport disadvantages associated with these target groups. A higher negative correlation between older people and mobility resources/burdens can be observed for the following variables: accessibility by walking to activities, availability of walking and cycling infrastructure, and availability of car-sharing services. When measured against exposure to negative transport effects, a higher positive correlation was observed. The paper ends with a discussion section on the relevance and usability of the proposed framework for transport planning and policy and its limitations.","Haxhija, Sindi","Duran-Rodas, David","Larriva, Maria Teresa Baquero","Wulfhorst, Gebhard",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT,Mobility justice,Distribution,Recognition,Disadvantaged groups,Framework,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,A Mobility Justice Framework to prioritize areas for mobility interventions

In this study, we developed a database of 50 MaaS projects in Japan, primarily covering regional and rural areas, to summarize their business stages and attributes including service type, evaluation indicators, objectives, and stakeholders. Subsequently, we analyzed the factors associated with project continuity using descriptive statistics, cross-tabulation, and ordered logit modeling. The results showed that projects that used user satisfaction as an evaluation indicator and improvements in public transportation service qualities as an objective were more likely to continue than those that did not. The evaluation that focused on changes in the number of passengers exhibited a negative relationship with continuity. Moreover, continuity was positively associated with projects incorporating AI-driven demand-responsive transport and/or multimodal services as well as those in target areas with formulated local public transportation plans. These results indicate that the projects had difficulty achieving the target change in the number of passengers and that the satisfaction evaluation might have yielded higher scores; additionally, the projects that focused on key concepts of MaaS continued.

The research aims to analyze the role of HSR in intercity commuting using survey data and semi-structured interviews with intercity commuters to or from Shanghai within the metropolitan area. While traditional factors remain relevant in explaining intercity commuting, the qualitative information adds new insights into whether HSR induces intercity commuting and how HSR competes with other intercity travel modes for intercity commuters. Our results show that: (1) HSR expands labour mobility for intercity commuters at a tolerable cost in time and money; (2) HSR commuters were found to live and work within a 10 km radius of the stations. Workplaces were found to be closer to stations than residents; (3) HSR is more competitive for weekly commutes of more than 2 h one-way and daily commutes of less than 2-2.5 h (100 km). This research helps to understand the role of HSR in regional integration and labour mobility.","Gao, Ya","Pan, Haixiao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,"SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACTS OF HIGH-SPEED RAIL SYSTEMS, IW-HSR 2023",,High-speed rail,Regional integration,Labour mobility,Intercity commuting,China,,,,,,,,,,,2024,Understanding the Role of High-Speed Rail on Intercity Commuting: Evidence from the Shanghai Metropolitan Area

In this direction, there are challenges regarding the creation of coherence between the locations of metro stations and their surroundings, which has been explored extensively in the academic community. This process is called Transit-Oriented Development (TOD). Within the context of Latin America, this study seeks to assess the influence of the built environment on the metro ridership in the metropolitan area of Valpara & iacute;so, Chile, testing two approaches of influence area definition, one of which is a fixed distance from the stations, and the other is based on the origin and destination survey of the study area. The analysis is based on Ordinary Least Squares regression (OLS) to identify the factors from the built environment, which affects the metro's ridership. Results show that the models based on the area of influence defined through the use of the origin and destination survey explain the metro ridership better. Moreover, this study reveals that the metro system in Greater Valpara & iacute;so was not planned in harmony with urban development. The models demonstrate an inverse effect of the built environment on ridership, contrasting with the expected outcomes of a metro station designed following a Transit-Oriented Development approach.","Aprigliano, Vicente","Seriani, Sebastian","Toro, Catalina","Rojas, Gonzalo","Fukushi, Mitsuyoshi","Cardoso, Marcus","Silva, Marcelino Aurelio Vieira da","Cucumides, Cristo","de Oliveira, Ualison Rebula","Henriquez, Cristian","Braun, Andreas","Hochschild, Volker",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION,area of influence,built environment,metro ridership,Valpara & iacute;so,Chile,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 2024,"Built Environment Effect on Metro Ridership in Metropolitan Area of Valparaíso, Chile, under Different Influence Area Approaches"
Row_26,"In Italy, where bicycle culture is struggling to catch on, the Extraordinary Plan for Tourism Mobility 2017-22 aims to increase the accessibility of tourist sites through safe and pleasant cycling routes, interconnected with other modes of transport. These same objectives have been pursued by Sardinia, one of the Italian regions more attractive to tourists, through the design of a regional cycle network and a long-distance tourist cycling routes (Ciclovia della Sardegna). The current study focuses on tourism mobility in the metropolitan city of Cagliari, the largest urban area in Sardinia, and aims to explore how much the existing and planned cycling routes constitute an alternative mobility solution for tourists who intend to reach the beaches. In particular, the study aims to evaluate the level of accessibility offered by bicycling to the beaches, which are among the most visited and attractive places for tourists, before and after the implementation of a regional bike tourism network system. A GIS-based procedure was employed and the method comprised of three main steps: (1) data collection and preparation, (2) GIS analysis, and (3) assessment of results. We performed two main types of analysis using GIS. First, we delineated service areas around each beach for various distances. Then, we overlaid and analyzed these areas in conjunction with the accommodation facilities. Second, we measured the accessibility of beaches using a gravity-based accessibility index. Our results demonstrate that, following the implementation of the regional cycle network Sardinia, various zones in the metropolitan area of Cagliari significantly increased their level of accessibility to the beaches, while others did not. Importantly, the adopted methodology has proven to be a valid tool for assessing cycling accessibility for different infrastructure scenarios.","Piras, Francesco","Sottile, Eleonora","Meloni, Italo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,CASE STUDIES ON TRANSPORT POLICY,Sustainable tourism,Accessibility,Cycling,GIS,Gravity-based index,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2024,Supporting tourism through the promotion of cycling: GIS model applied in the metropolitan area of Cagliari (Italy)

While numerous studies have examined these phenomena, there is still a need for empirical evidence that not only documents what occurred but also provides actionable insights for future transport planning. This study aims to enhance understanding of public transport passengers' mobility behaviors during different stages of the pandemic, using the Metropolitan Area of Porto, Portugal, as a case study. Automated Fare Collection data from 2020 were analyzed and compared with data from the pre-pandemic year of 2019. The analysis included temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal, and sociodemographic dimensions. Key patterns and trends identified include a rapid recovery of ridership post-restriction easing, homogenized daily travel patterns, varied impacts on different transport modes, and significant shifts in demographic travel behaviors. These findings highlight the resilience of public transport demand and suggest that adaptive scheduling, enhanced safety measures, targeted support for vulnerable groups, promotion of off-peak travel, investment in bus infrastructure, and encouragement of multi-modal transport are essential strategies. Implementing these strategies can help improve public transport planning and mitigate the adverse effects of future crises.","Ferreira, Marta Campos","Fernandes, Hugo","Sobral, Thiago","Dias, Teresa Galvao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,EUROPEAN TRANSPORT RESEARCH REVIEW,Pandemic,AFC,Travel patterns,Spatio-temporal,Sociodemographic,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 8 2024,Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on mobility behavior of public transport passengers: the case of Metropolitan Area of Porto

To assess these effects, a case study was conducted in Tokyo using an urban canopy model. We quantified the impact and characterize its spatio-temporal structure, through a comparative evaluation with other forms of e-mobility (hybrid electric vehicles and fuel cell vehicles) and established UHI measures (ground greening and cool roofs). EVs showed the largest effect among all e-mobilities, both in absolute temperature reduction (Delta T) and cooling efficiency (Delta T per reduced heat), owing to the positive feedback on atmospheric stability. The Delta T caused by EV is more pronounced in the morning and evening hours, and in urban centers. On the other hand, the Delta T due to UHI measures peaks at midday and is more pronounced in suburban areas. In other words, they complement each other spatially and temporally. The peak Delta T caused by the EVs exceeded that of the UHI measures by approximately 40% of the total area. The contribution of indirect CO2 mitigation is negligible in the life-cycle CO2 emissions of EVs.","Yamaguchi, Kazuki","Takane, Yuya","Ihara, Tomohiko",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,URBAN CLIMATE,Urban canopy model,Urban heat island,E-mobility,Urban green space,Cool roof,IndirectCO2 mitigation,,,,,,,,,,MAY 2024,Climate change adaptation and mitigation potential of EVs in Tokyo metropolitan area

Accessibility is a key issue for scientific disciplines applied to territorial governance. In fact, it expresses the level of organization of the territory and in particular of the services, for this reason it is considered as a fundamental aspect for its proper functioning.Furthermore, with the transition from the municipal administrative dimension to the metropolitan one, accessibility assumes a preponderant role for the governance of the metropolitan cities/region increasingly characterized by multidirectional and multi-purpose mobility and by a significant vulnerability of the community.

Using various data sources, previous studies have examined several deep learning frameworks, such as the RNN and GAN, to synthesize human movements. Transformer models have been used frequently for image analysis and language processing, while the applications of these models on human mobility are limited. In this study, we construct a transformer model, including a self-attention-based embedding component and a Generative Pre-trained Transformer component, to learn daily movements. The embedding component takes regional attributes as input and learns regional relationships to output vector representations for locations, enabling the second component to generate different mobility patterns for various scenarios. The proposed model shows satisfactory performance for generating and predicting human mobilities, superior to a Long Short-Term Memory model in terms of several aggregated statistics and sequential characteristics. Further examination indicates that the proposed model learned the spatial structure and the temporal relationship of human mobility, which generally agrees with our empirical analysis. This observation suggests that the transformer framework can be a promising model for learning and understanding human movements.","Wang, Weiying","Osaragi, Toshihiro",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION,daily mobility generation,mobility prediction,transformer-based model,self-attention mechanism,Tokyo Metropolitan Area,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 2024,Learning Daily Human Mobility with a Transformer-Based Model

It is commonly presumed that the improved mobility and accessibility provided by subway systems are capitalized as a financial premium for nearby real estate assets. This study empirically explores this presumption with a case study of Gwangju, a metropolitan area in South Korea. The study site is found to have had a negative economic impact on housing prices from a subway system in the mid-2010s; however, the sign has changed over time, although the subway has experienced no actual expansion or operational changes. This indicates that the economic impact of subway systems may not necessarily become positive or remain static. We examine a wide range of local contexts to explain the sign change. Our study adopts machine learning algorithms to precisely address the nonlinearity inherent in our dataset and quantifies the importance of housing factors in the assessment of housing prices using SHapley Additive exPlanation. We also employ a series of hedonic pricing models to determine the effects of proximity to subway lines on housing prices across years. Key changes in the later 2010s, including the increased modal share of the subway system and local politics, should have resulted in the potential benefits of the to-be-extended network being widely and fully realized.

Row_34,"In Japan, while depopulation, aging, and urbanization have caused inter-prefectural migration to decline, net migration to the Tokyo metropolitan area (Tokyo ), the Osaka metropolitan area (Osaka ), the Nagoya metropolitan area (Nagoya ), and the non-metropolitan area (NonMA) ) has generally been maintained. The mechanism of this phenomenon is clarified. Using the number of migrants in the Annual Report on Internal Migration in Japan derived from the Basic Resident Registers and the number of people from the Population Census of Japan, out-migration, crude out-migration rate, and standardized out-migration ratio by destination are analyzed, and changes in out-migration are decomposed into demographic and mobility factors. The results show that propensities of inter-metropolitan migration to and from the Tokyo have been increasing, especially from Osaka and Nagoya to Tokyo, and are more pronounced among women than among men. However, migration propensities between Osaka and Nagoya weakened slightly. On the other hand, migration propensities from metropolitan areas to Non-MA declined substantially, whereas those from Non-MA to metropolitan areas were moderate, and those to Tokyo and Nagoya increased or were maintained. In the discussion, first, the mechanism behind the persistence of net migration in the four regions is explored from the viewpoints of migration propensity and the hypothesis of mobility transition. It is argued that while the attractiveness of Tokyo to people from Osaka and Nagoya increased, the attractiveness of Non-MA to people from the metropolitan areas decreased significantly, and that the attractiveness of Osaka relative to Nagoya weakened. In addition, the results shown for Japan are generally consistent with those presented in the hypothesis of mobility transition proposed by Zelinsky. Their association with the socioeconomic context behind the persistence of net migration is discussed. Because Japan's economy has stagnated and local economies of non-MA have been shrinking due to population decline and aging, people are more likely to think that better opportunities exist in Tokyo or Osaka or Nagoya. This could have increased the attractiveness of Tokyo among people in Osaka and Nagoya, and decreased the attractiveness of Non-MA among people in metropolitan areas.","Yoshidome, Hitomi","Yamauchi, Masakazu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY-CHIGAKU ZASSHI,migration,migration propensity,population aging,standardized out-migration ratio,metropolitan area,non-metropolitan area,,,,,,,,,,2024,A Decomposition Analysis of Internal Migration Propensity Changes from 1980 to 2015 in Japan
Row_35,"Objective We investigated whether a zip code's location or demographics are most predictive of changes in daily mobility throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.Design We used a population-level study to examine the predictability of daily mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic using a two-stage regression approach, where generalised additive models (GAM) predicted mobility trends over time at a large spatial level, then the residuals were used to determine which factors (location, zip code-level features or number of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in place) best predict the difference between a zip code's measured mobility and the average trend on a given date.Setting We analyse zip code-level mobile phone records from 26 metropolitan areas in the USA on 15 March-31 September 2020, relative to October 2020.Results While relative mobility had a general trend, a zip code's city-level location significantly helped to predict its daily mobility patterns. This effect was time-dependent, with a city's deviation from general mobility trends differing in both direction and magnitude throughout the course of 2020. The characteristics of a zip code further increased predictive power, with the densest zip codes closest to a city centre tended to have the largest decrease in mobility. However, the effect on mobility change varied by city and became less important over the course of the pandemic.Conclusions The location and characteristics of a zip code are important for determining changes in daily mobility patterns throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. These results can determine the efficacy of NPI implementation on multiple spatial scales and inform policy makers on whether certain NPIs should be implemented or lifted during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and when preparing for future public health emergencies.","Schaber, Kathryn","Arambepola, Rohan","Schluth, Catherine","Labrique, Alain B.","Mehta, Shruti H.","Solomon, Sunil S.","Cummings, Derek A.

Studies have concluded that these differences are largely attributable to household responsibilities typically falling disproportionately on women, leading to women being more likely to utilize transit for purposes referred to by the umbrella concept of ""Mobility of Care"". In contrast to past studies that have quantified the impact of gender using survey and qualitative data, we examine a novel data-driven workflow utilizing a combination of previously developed origin, destination, and transfer inference (ODX) based on individual transit fare card transactions, name-based gender inference, and geospatial analysis as a framework to identify mobility of care trip making. We apply this framework to data from the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Analyzing data from millions of journeys conducted in the first quarter of 2019, the results of this study show that our proposed workflow can identify mobility of care travel behavior, both in terms of (1) detecting times and places of interest where the share of women travelers in an equally-sampled subset (on basis of inferred gender) of transit users is 10 %-15 % higher than that of men, and (2) finding women significantly more likely to exhibit a consistent accompaniment patterns with riders who are children, elderly, or people with disabilities.

By integrating census data with spatial models, we examined the relationships between park visitation, proximity of parks to visitors' home neighbourhoods, and socio-economic variables such as race and ethnicity. Our analysis revealed that park visitation increases with proximity to visitors' home neighbourhoods. We also found positive associations between visitation rates and factors such as population density, median income, and park coverage in visitors' home neighbourhoods. Additionally, we identified significant correlations between park visitation and the racial and ethnic composition of these neighbourhoods. These findings confirm the assumption that closer proximity to parks enhances visitation rates.

The findings reveal significant variations in mobility choices across the identified lifestyle segments with environmentally conscious segments showing a higher propensity for sustainable modes of transport. Additionally, differences are observed in perceptions and intentions regarding micromobility and the future mass transit system within the region, suggesting that when introducing a new metro system that is expected to promote a shift toward public transport, segment-specific approaches are necessary for raising awareness and increasing trust to the new mode.","Chatziathanasiou, Maria","Botzoris, George","Morfoulaki, Maria","Kotoula, Kornilia-Maria",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,lifestyles,mobility choices,attitudes,segmentation analysis,sustainable mobility,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,A Lifestyle-Based Perspective on the Mobility Choices and Preferences of Urban Travelers

Differences across racial groups in intergenerational mobility (IM) have been identified as a key source of this persistence. However, efforts to understand racial inequality in IM have rarely considered the role of urban sprawl. This article argues that urban sprawl affects differences in IM between racial groups directly and indirectly through racial segregation, racial bias, and social capital. We analyze data from 874 metropolitan counties in the US using structural equation models to test these direct and indirect effects of sprawl on racial inequality in IM. We found that urban sprawl was negatively associated with racial inequality in IM. The direct effect, which we partially attribute to higher racial disparities in social capital in more compact counties, was statistically significant. For the indirect effects, racial segregation had the largest mediating effects between urban sprawl and racial inequality in IM, followed by economic connectedness (EC) and racial bias. The net indirect effect of sprawl on racial inequality in IM was negative because negative indirect effects through racial segregation and EC outweigh positive indirect effects through racial bias. Our findings demonstrate the significant role of urban form in racial inequality in IM.","Xiong, Ning","Wei, Yehua Dennis","Rey, Sergio J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY,racial inequality,intergenerational mobility,urban sprawl,compact development,county,J62,D63,O20,R10,R58,,,,,,MAR 22 2024,Urban sprawl and racial inequality in intergenerational mobility

However, challenges related to discomfort and noise pollution arising from rail traffic must be addressed and mitigated to foster a harmonious coexistence between residents and trains. This study focuses on analyzing an experimental campaign conducted on the surface metropolitan network of Porto to study and identify the frequency content and pressure levels associated with light rail traffic. The presented experimental campaign holds significant relevance as it comprises various and distinct circulation conditions within the railway network, enabling a comprehensive characterization of railway noise. The collected data indicates a noticeable increase in sound pressure levels as the speed of circulation rises, particularly emphasizing the 1/3 octave band centered around 1000 Hz. The choice of tracks with components having a limited capacity for absorbing acoustic energy leads to a significant rise in noise levels compared to track solutions with elements exhibiting excellent acoustic energy absorption. Furthermore, the study highlights a substantial increase in noise levels (10 dBA) associated with small radius curves, even at low speeds. These findings underscore the importance of considering the track characteristics and geometric features in noise assessment within rail networks.

It suggests that individual environmental exposures tend toward the average exposure in the study area when considering human mobility. However, the universality of the NEAP across various environmental exposures and the mechanisms underlying its occurrence remain unclear. Here, using a large human mobility data set of more than 27 000 individuals in the Chicago Metropolitan Area, we provide robust evidence of the existence of the NEAP in a range of individual environmental exposures, including green spaces, air pollution, healthy food environments, transit accessibility, and crime rates. We also unveil the social and spatial disparities in the NEAP's influence on individual environmental exposure estimates. To further reveal the mechanisms behind the NEAP, we perform multiscenario analyses based on environmental variation and human mobility simulations. The results reveal that the NEAP is a statistical phenomenon of regression to the mean (RTM) under the constraints of spatial autocorrelation in environmental data. Increasing travel distances and out-of-home durations can intensify and promote the NEAP's impact, particularly for highly dynamic environmental factors like air pollution.

Yet exposures to tree canopy coverage in other spaces visited during the week or on weekends outside the home neighborhoods remains largely unexplored. Objectives: We examined whether differences in coverage levels of tree canopy in neighborhoods visited compared to home neighborhoods was associated with lower prevalence of coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, adjusting for exposure to home canopy coverage. We further investigated if the associations varied across levels of home canopy coverage, and if they were more pronounced on weekdays or weekends. Methods: We used 2018 mobile phone data from the twenty largest U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). For each home census tract, we derived a weighted tree canopy coverage exposure from all visited tracts based on the proportion of visits to other tracts by home tract residents. We subtracted home canopy coverage from the weighted canopy coverage in each of the visited tracts to calculate tract-specific differences. We evaluated associations between differences in tree canopy coverage and prevalence of CHD and stroke via spatial error models, adjusting for tract-level home canopy coverage, MSA, socioeconomic and built environment characteristics. Results: For every ten-percentage-point increase in tree canopy coverage in visited tracts relative to home tracts, there was a 0.32-0.34% decrease in stroke prevalence. Association with CHD prevalence was not observed after adjusting for spatial autocorrelation. Variations between weekdays and weekends were minimal. The difference in tree canopy coverage was associated with CHD prevalence only for home tracts with low tree canopy coverage, while the difference was associated with stroke prevalence across home tracts with low, moderate, and high tree canopy coverage, with diminishing effect size. Discussion: This study identified that greater tree canopy coverage in visited neighborhoods relative to home neighborhoods was associated with lower stroke prevalence, and associations varied across home neighborhoods with different tree canopy coverage levels. It emphasized the need to factor in the neighborhood mobility networks in urban planning initiatives to promote cardiovascular health.","Wei, Hanxue","Renson, Audrey","Huang, Xiao","Thorpe, Lorna E.","Spoer, Ben R.","Charles, Suzanne L.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,HEALTH & PLACE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2024,Assessing potential benefits of visits to neighborhoods with higher tree canopy coverage using mobility data: Associations with cardiovascular health outcomes in twenty US metropolitan areas
Row_46,"The term ""housing ladder"" refers to the phenomenon of people moving from one housing type to another according to changing demands of different life stages. This phenomenon is observed in many countries and is known as the Jutaku Sugoroku Paradigm in the Japanese context. This study aims to clarify whether adult children's access to homeownership might be affected by their parents' homeownership and their place of origin. Questionnaire Data from a survey across Japan's two largest metropolitan areas, Tokyo and Osaka, were analyzed by combining crosstabulations and a binomial logit model. The results revealed that individuals are more likely to attain homeownership if they come from a metropolitan area and if their home of origin is an owner-occupied house. These findings suggest that housing inequality is being passed on to the next generation by parents' homeownership status and residential location. Japanese housing policies that promote private ownership of housing may reinforce these inequalities. The study concludes that Japan experiences the same intergenerational transmission of housing inequality due to homeownership as other countries, whereas place of origin was an additional factor for homeownership in the Japanese context.","Fukuda, Ryo","Sho, Kojiro","Kidokoro, Tetsuo","Lim, Hwajin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,CITIES,Japan,Housing inequality,Housing ladder,Homeownership,Birthplace,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2024,Inheriting housing inequality: Parental homeownership and place of origin as key factors for homeownership in Japanese metropolitan areas

Alleviating traffic congestion in metropolitan areas has been a persistent challenge for decades, leading to increased interest in aerial mobility solutions. Recent advancements in distributed electric propulsion, battery technology, and autonomous navigation have made electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft a feasible option for intercity transport. For efficient UAM systems, we optimize the high-level planning of UAMs, i.e., determine the numbers of eVTOLs, vertiport spaces, and chargers, together with lowerlevel operations to control each eVTOL's operational state between in-service, charging, idling, and relocating. Accounting for spatio-temporal demand and cost heterogeneity, we formulate the UAM optimization framework as a mixed-integer programming problem. In our numerical study, we analyze a scenario involving three hypothetical vertiports in the Seoul Metropolitan Area, South Korea. The results reveal relationships between the optimal solution and several exogenous factors critical to eVTOL operations, including the targeted level of service for users and eVTOL charging speed. Additionally, we conduct Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate the robustness of our solution against stochastic demand and variations in electric consumption.","Shon, Heeseung","Lee, Jinwoo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF AIR TRANSPORT MANAGEMENT,Urban air mobility,Electric vertical take-off and landing,Planning,Operation,Demand and cost heterogeneity,Optimization,,,,,,,,,,APR 2025,An optimization framework for urban air mobility (UAM) planning and operations

They constitute an opportunity to create new urban hubs, considered as nodes of intermodality and places of urban intensity. In order to effectively plan the future locations of shared mobility hubs, this paper outlines the methodological framework that sustains the design of a new decision-support tool, the so-called Mcda2MobilityHub (M2MHub),1 using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). For this purpose, the analysis of existing literature and interviews with local authorities and transport operators, led to the identification of six main location criteria (mobility, compactness, diversity of uses, profile of potential users, spatial configuration and environment). The criteria weights were calculated using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the framework was applied to the case study of the city of Barcelona. The results obtained are presented in the form of heat maps, highlighting the flexibility of the decision-support tool to transform open data into appropriate indicators and detailed maps.

While considerable attention has been paid to the impacts of health risks and teleworking, two prominent topics related to health-crisis-led migration, empirical evidence remains inadequate. This study aims to empirically investigate the impacts and temporal changes of these two factors on migration leaving MAs (LMA migration). It utilizes survey data from the Japanese government and employs fixed effects logit models. (1) By using infection rates in a more accurate measurement than previous studies, this study confirms the health-risk-aversion motives in LMA migration. (2) Teleworking's influence on LMA migration is found to be insignificant over the long term. Nevertheless, it increases the likelihood of formal employees staying in MAs and strengthens the tendency of the self-employed to leave for local areas. (3) Temporally, the significant impact of lower COVID-19 infection rates attracting metropolitan residents persisted beyond the pandemic stringency and continued for several months afterward, though it eventually reversed. Teleworking shows a positive influence on LMA migration only in the later stage of COVID-19. These findings suggest a tendency of 'deferred decisions' in LMA migration due to people's unfamiliarity with an unprecedented health crisis. However, the negative impact of infection risks emerges sooner than the significant effect of teleworking, indicating that safety is a pressing priority for LMA migration in the early stages of a major health crisis. (4) Self-employed individuals, homeworkers, and the unemployed are more likely to engage in LMA migration, while employees (whether formal or informal) are less likely, highlighting the role of opportunity costs. Policy implications suggest that local governments should focus on attracting the self-employed from MAs during health crises and on enhancing the teleworking environment for the long term.","Peng, Xue",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 8 2024,Migration behaviors leaving metropolitan areas: assessing the impacts of health risks and teleworking in the COVID-19 context

Row_53,"Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is a new mode of transportation that avoids ground congestion in metropolitan areas. UAM services between airports and city centers are planned to start first, so a vertiport is needed at the airport. For better customer service and increased UAM demand, the vertiport should be as close as possible to the passenger terminal. However, in order to maintain separation from departures and arrivals, UAM aircraft have to divert long distances or cross the runway to enter and exit the vertiport. In this study, aircraft trajectories at Incheon International Airport (ICN) were analyzed to determine the feasibility of the runway crossing operation. The results showed that there is no spatial area where UAM aircraft can cross the runway separately from arriving and departing aircraft, but there are time slots available for runway crossing. Redefining the runway occupancy time would increase the available runway crossing time for UAM aircraft. However, such a time -based runway crossing approach would inevitably require the UAM aircraft to hover or require controller intervention. A four-dimensional trajectory -based UAM operation and automated lighting system would minimize the need for controller intervention. This study analyzed the surveillance data of ICN to propose a runway crossing operation for UAM aircraft at ICN, and a future work will propose a more precise runway crossing strategy by using more surveillance data of the airport.","Kim, Sang Hyun",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN SOCIETY FOR AERONAUTICAL AND SPACE SCIENCES,Urban Air Mobility,Runway Crossing,Vertiport,Airport,,,,,,,,,,,,2024,Runway Crossing Operation for Urban Air Mobility in Incheon International Airport

However, a critical knowledge gap exists in terms of the extent to which socio-spatial networks shaped by human mobility exacerbate or alleviate urban heat exposures of populations in cities. In this study, we utilize location-based data to construct human mobility networks in twenty metropolitan areas in the U.S. The human mobility networks are analyzed in conjunction with the urban heat characteristics of spatial areas. We identify areas with high and low urban heat exposure and evaluate visitation patterns of populations residing in high and low urban heat areas to other spatial areas with similar and dissimilar urban heat exposure. The results reveal the presence of urban heat traps in the majority of the studied metropolitan areas, wherein populations residing in high-heat exposure areas primarily visited other high-heat exposure zones. Specifically, cities such as Los Angeles, Boston, and Chicago were particularly pronounced as urban heat traps. The results also show a small percentage of human mobility to produce urban heat escalation and heat escapes. The findings from this study provide a better understanding of urban heat exposure in cities based on patterns of human mobility.

A challenge associated with designed greenways pertains to their underutilization for mobility.

This study addresses this issue by devising a methodology for the identification of optimal locations for active urban greenways within a metropolitan expanse, strategically aligned with the day-to-day pursuits of its inhabitants. Distinguished from prior greenway research, this investigation emphasizes individual mobility and adds a novel perspective to greenway planning. The method was tested in the city of Mashhad in Iran. By employing the Analytic Hierarchy Process methodology in conjunction with a Geographic Information System (GIS) and a gravity formula, a meticulous selection process yielded 19 nodes (sites) deemed most suitable for greenway implementation, selected from a pool of 93 prospective nodes.

This paper presents a micro -simulation framework combining the multi -state supernetwork (MSN) approach and a mobility -related emission module to evaluate the mobility and environmental effects of LRT developments. The evaluation framework considers individuals' mode choice of LRT and particularly the trip chaining with their private vehicles to conduct daily activity programs. As complementary policies to LRT developments, parking pricing and park & ride (P + R) developments are also integrated. The output of daily travel patterns from the MSN approach can be used congruently to calculate the air pollutant emissions. The framework is applied to the extended Metropolitan area of Eindhoven (the Netherlands), where new LRT developments and additional parking policies are considered to improve accessibility and reduce environmental effects. The microsimulation concerns a synthetic population of approximately 110,000 individuals and seven LRT scenarios. The simulation results show a decrease in overall vehicle kilometers traveled and travel time, an increase in public transport use, a decrease in total air pollutant emissions, and an increase in activities in areas around public transport stops and P + R locations.

Given the previous reports of zoonotic parasites and fungal pathogens in the cat population in Thailand, there is a potential for these pathogens to be present in cat caf & eacute;s. The objective of this study is to investigate the prevalence of potentially zoonotic enteric parasites and dermatophytes in cat caf & eacute;s in Bangkok and its vicinity. Out of 11 cat caf & eacute;s, zoonotic enteric nematodes composed of hookworm and roundworm were identified in 2 caf & eacute;s. Furthermore, fungal cultures of individual cat hair samples indicated that 16.2% (32/198) of the cats were positive for dermatophytosis. In summary, zoonotic parasites and dermatophytes were detected in cat caf & eacute;s in Bangkok and the surrounding provinces. The evidence based on the prevalence and risk factors associated with these pathogens will heighten awareness among stakeholders and customers involved in this business.Abstract Cat caf & eacute;s have gained significant popularity worldwide, offering a unique interface between humans and cats. The present study aims to assess the prevalence of potentially zoonotic endoparasites and dermatophytes from cats living in cat caf & eacute;s situated in the Bangkok metropolitan area in 2017-2018. Cat fecal samples were subjected to microscopic examination employing centrifugal flotation and centrifugal sedimentation techniques. The hair samples from every cat were cultured on a dermatophyte test medium and Sabouraud dextrose agar and subsequently confirmed by visualization of the typical colony and macroconidia morphology. Findings from 11 cat caf & eacute;s indicated an 18.2% (2/11) prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites, including Toxocara spp., Ancylostoma spp., Physaloptera spp., and Eucoleus aerophilus. Dermatophytes were prevalent in 16.2% (32/198) of the total number of cats tested, with Microsporum canis being the sole species identified. Notably, the presence of dermatophyte was significantly correlated with the presence of skin lesions and the cats' origin. In summary, the findings of this study have provided evidence of potentially zoonotic endoparasites and dermatophytes in cats residing in cat caf & eacute;s. Therefore, it is imperative to heighten awareness and encourage preventive measures among cat caf & eacute; owners and customers to halt the dissemination of these pathogens.","Sanguansook, Phakjira","Tuangpermsub, Siwaporn","Leelakarnsakul, Boonyakorn","Phaisansomsuk, Sutida","Hunprasit, Vachira","Del Rio, Laura","Niyomtham, Waree","Prapasarakul, Nuvee","Sukhumavasi, Woraporn",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,VETERINARY SCIENCES,Bangkok,cat caf & eacute;,dermatophyte,gastrointestinal parasites,zoonosis,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 2024,"Zoonotic Enteric Nematodes and Dermatophytes in Cat Cafés: An Investigation in the Bangkok Metropolitan Area, Thailand"

Furthermore, this study compared the differential effects of population distribution and population mobility in identifying urban spatial structures. The empirical research results for Zhengzhou City demonstrate that the accuracy of using LandScan data fusion to identify multi-centre spatial structures was 0.7463, while the accuracy of using night-time light data fusion to identify urban spatial structures through population mobility reached 0.8235. This suggests that, in the context of increasing population mobility and economic activity, the integration of population mobility data may have a significant impact on the accuracy of urban spatial research.

To operate in urban environments, precise air traffic management, in particular the management of traffic overflows due to physical and operational disruptions will be critical to ensuring system safety and efficiency. To this end, we propose UAM network design with reserve capacity, i.e., a design where alternative landing options and flight corridors are explicitly considered as a means of improving contingency management. Similar redundancy considerations are incorporated in the design of many critical infrastructures, yet remain unexploited in the air transportation literature. In our methodology, we first model how disruptions to a given UAM network might impact on the nominal traffic flow and how this flow might be re-accommodated on an extended network with reserve capacity. Then, through an optimization problem, we select the locations and capacities for the backup vertiports with the maximal expected throughput of the extended network over all possible disruption scenarios, while the throughput is the maximal amount of flights that the network can accommodate per unit of time. We show that we can obtain the solution for the corresponding bi-level and bi-linear optimization problem by solving a mixed integer linear program. We demonstrate our methodology in the case study using networks from Milwaukee, Atlanta, and Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan areas and show how the throughput and flexibility of the UAM networks with reserve capacity can outcompete those without.","Wei, Qinshuang","Gao, Zhenyu","Clarke, John-Paul","Topcu, Ufuk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL,Urban air mobility,Air transportation,Network design,Network optimization,Disruption,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2024,Risk-aware urban air mobility network design with overflow redundancy

Row_69,"Designing public transit services that meet the needs of night shift workers requires understanding their commuting patterns. However, traditional survey methods have faced challenges in contacting and interviewing night shift workers with changing work-sleep schedules. This study aims to investigate night shift workers' commuting patterns by identifying night shift workers with heterogeneous working patterns in passive mobility data. First, we identify workers and their workplaces from the mobility data using a rule-based method. Subsequently, we cluster individual workers' workplace-staying records using DBSCAN to find regular working patterns and segment workers with diverse working patterns. We applied the method to the smart card data of Seoul, South Korea, and identified 37,448 night shift workers with six different working patterns. The proportion of night shift workers among presumed workers was 8.9%, which was slightly higher than the 7.2% reported in a national survey. Workers who exclusively worked at nighttime worked near night markets, while three-shift workers' workplaces mainly appeared near areas with large general hospitals with emergency care centers. The proportion, regular working patterns, and workplace location distribution of the identified night shift workers were generally consistent with the existing survey-based knowledge, suggesting that night shift workers were accurately discovered from the mobility data. The finding suggested that policies to extend transit service time were beneficial for three-shift and 24-hour duty workers. With the proposed method, night shift workers' regular and essential mobility needs can be identified and provided to cities' transit authorities to help assess and improve transit services for these workers.","Lim, Sungho","Ahn, Haesung","Shin, Seungchul","Lee, Dongmin","Kim, Yong Hoon",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,Night shift worker,Commuting pattern,Passive mobility data,Travel behavior,Transportation equity,Data mining,DBSCAN,,,,,,,,,MAR 2024,Investigating night shift workers' commuting patterns using passive mobility data

Following a comprehensive review of previous studies, a taxonomic classification of places of care is developed, and a method is proposed to diagnose their availability and diversity in pedestrian-accessible urban environments within 200m, 400m, and 800m from light rail stations. This method was applied on Line 2 of the TRAM in Alicante, Spain, using the social network Google Places as the main source of information. The results emphasize the importance of addressing the 3-minute scale (200m) in urban environments surrounding light rail stations and the limited representation of places of care in these areas.

While technological change is a primary driver for models of development, the policy pathways, implementation and implications of MaaS are complex and unclear. In this paper, we explore the implications and limitations of a participatory approach to co-produced MaaS futures in Greater Manchester (GM). We adapt a backcasting methodology involving two stakeholder workshops to develop shared future visions and action pathways. Our methodology includes a participatory approach to pluralistic vision development and the use of a Three Horizons method for backcasting. This approach provides the opportunity to explore multiple desirable futures and the formulation of action pathways without negating plausible future possibilities. The research identifies multiple policy and collaborative action areas while also revealing limitations in MaaS user agency and unaddressed sustainability concerns related to wider Smart City criticisms. Findings also suggest a lack of adequate theory within current MaaS frameworks to engage with uncertainty, change and adaptive capacity.

We present an optimal planning framework for fleet size and vertiport numbers using generalized cost models of UAM trip chains with two different ground access modes for first and last mile trips, including taxis and robotaxis (i.e. autonomous taxis or shared autonomous vehicles). As it is a relatively new and untested mode of transportation, our research aims to provide a decision-making tool for initial UAM system planning and analysis of its economic feasibility, appropriately considering its unique characteristics, such as high free-flow speed, low circuity, needs for ground access, and specific cost factors, such as vertiport and electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft costs. Through a parametric study, we quantitatively examine the necessary conditions for UAM, with or without ridesharing, to become more economically viable than other ground-only modes. The study confirms that UAM can have potential economic benefits especially in large cities with longer average trip lengths and severe traffic congestion, where the average ground vehicle speed is low.","Shon, Heeseung","Kim, Sanggyu","Lee, Jinwoo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION,Economic feasibility,ground access trips,optimal planning,trip chain,urban air mobility,,,,,,,,,,,APR 1 2024,Optimal planning of urban air mobility systems accounting for ground access trips

Facility location problems are well studied and of significant importance for various transportation modes. This work introduces a vertiport location identification framework, focusing on demand coverage and infrastructure accessibility. An Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) model was utilized for the identification of candidate vertiport locations, along with a k-means algorithm, for comparison and validation purposes, based on an estimated UAM demand pattern. A genetic algorithm (GA) was then formulated, for the solution of the proposed Uncapacitated and Capacitated Vertiport Location Problems (UVLP and CVLP, respectively), variations of the Uncapacitated and Capacitated Facility Location Problems. To evaluate and compare the introduced methodology, different existing facility location problems (FLPs) were considered and solved exactly using integer and linear programming. These are the Location Set Covering Problem (LSCP), the Maximal Coverage Location Problem (MCLP), and the p-median problem.

Row_77,"Mobility as a Service (MaaS) has become an emerging trend in transportation planning and management due to its potential to overcome the challenges of urban mobility toward the achievement of sustainable mobility goals. This requires people to be willing to use MaaS apps. However, given their relative novelty, there is still a lack of research on the factors that influence the use of these apps, as well as the possible role of gender in such use. In this context, this study aims to explore the complex relationships between a set of relevant factors and their influence on the intention to adopt MaaS apps, with special attention to the role of gender as a moderating variable. For this purpose, a survey was conducted in the Madrid Metropolitan Area (Spain), comprising 8358 respondents (3627 men and 4731 women), and a four-step methodological procedure was adopted: (i) Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), (ii) Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), (iii) Structural Equation Model (SEM) on the total sample (iv) Gender-sensitive analysis, including a Multi-group analysis - SEM. The results demonstrate that technophilia, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are determining factors. Green values and attitudes toward shared modes have a notable total positive effect. However, contrary to expected, attitudes toward public transport, car and bicycle hardly explain the intention to adopt MaaS apps.

Row_79,"This study applies an agent-based approach to investigate the potential individual-level demand for and system-wide impacts of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) in the short- to long-term, in two real U.S. metropolitan areas. The UAM service we envision in this research provides mobility to ondemand requests from one vertiport to another. The investigations consider the existing electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft models (assuming they are piloted) and vertiport designs, while accounting for the uncertainties in (i) service attributes (e.g., time saving and service price), and (ii) demand characteristics (e.g., perceived waiting time in various conditions). Towards this goal, the state-of-the-art agent-based simulation platform SimMobility is expanded in this research with new modules required for realistic simulation of the demand, supply, and demand-supply interactions. The expanded platform adopts a high-fidelity model system with: (i) a behaviorally sound demand model to mimic the switching behavior from current non-UAM mode to UAM and to capture the individuals' willingness to pay and plan-action dynamics in decision-making; (ii) a detailed operation model to account for not only the integration of ground and aerial transportation but also fleet rebalancing and the intra-vertiport state dynamics such as charging, gate availability, taxiing, pre-landing hovering (as a result of capacity limitations), etc.; (iii) a demand-driven vertiport placement and capacity generation module. The results show that the UAM market is expected to start narrow (0.187% to 0.197% of all trips) and remain niche in the long term (1.45 % to 1.81 % of all trips) for both cities. In addition, the service is expected to increase mobility inequality, even in the long term. The potential UAM users turned out to be primarily high-income in all scenarios (e.g., 46.9 % to 59.2 % in the long term). Moreover, car-oriented individuals are identified as the main users - not only are most UAM trips expected to emerge from drive-alone trips (84.7 % to 92.8 % at launch), but also drivealone is expected to be the most preferred access/egress mode (78.4% to 83.6% share among all UAM trips at launch).

In Africa, however, there is little recent research into the phenomenon, even though African cities tend to have poor transport services, urban sprawl is extensive usually resulting in long travel times and high travel costs, and certain areas experience high levels of crime. By implication, there are several factors that impact the ability of people to access economic and societal opportunities, however these are not well documented. Building on previous work from several authors, this research sought to describe transport-related social exclusion in a large metropolitan area in an emerging economy.Methods Using a qualitative methodology, 60 interviews were conducted with City of Johannesburg residents. The data was analyzed using manual thematic and classic content analysis.Results The study found that residents often did not have access to services due to availability, but also that economic, geographic and fear-based exclusion were particularly prevalent in the sample, although there were several other psychological exclusion dimensions, as well as information exclusion.Discussion This study is the first recent study in South Africa to consider a wide range of commuters from varying demographic strata, thus providing a novel perspective on TRSE in a major urban area in the country. The study recommends that policy actions be considered, taking into account the minibus taxi industry, which is often overlooked in government policy. TRSE should also be an inherent element in urban (and other) transport planning, as well as take into account the broader societal realities faced by citizens. Future research directions include conducting broader quantitative studies across a variety of urban areas in South Africa, and beyond, to determine specific TRSE dimensions in various urban areas. Policy analysis is also recommended, to determine TRSE policy gaps and align interventions with specific commuter needs.","Luke, Rose",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE CITIES,transport-related social exclusion,mobility,Africa,Johannesburg,TRSE,developing country,emerging economy,,,,,,,,,FEB 7 2024,Transport-related social exclusion and mobility in developing countries: the South African case
Row_82,"A major problem for policymakers is to ensure that levels of citizen participation reflect the society in its diversity, but they must also ensure that those citizens who want to get involved have the means to do so. Despite empirical evidence of the role of urban planning in health, well-being, and livability, studies have not delved into the implications of how low-density sprawled urban forms influence civic involvement. This paper adds new evidence regarding the significance of urban form, built environment characteristics and more in general city planning, as intermediary factors between public and private life connected to civic engagement and public space use. Based on surveys and geographic data from the Greater Metropolitan Area of San Jose ', in Costa Rica, the article investigates how the results of citizen participation change depending on whether residents are from a compact or dispersed study area, relating to urban rhythms and mobility metrics. Findings suggest that inhabitants of group A (lower-density neighborhoods) differ significantly from group B (compact-city areas) in four variables: means of mobility, commuting time, public space use, and civic activism, while having similar sociodemographic composition. Compared with residents of group A, group B report higher levels of use and knowledge of public spaces and civic participation. These two aspects constitute, the Urban Civic Participation Index, which, related to self-reported free time, forms what we define as Public Time. The main characteristics of the compact city (higher population and building density, high street connectivity, grid presence and proximity of services, mixed land use) were found to be positively related to the outcomes of accessibility to public space and community participation. In contrast, there are no significant differences in the availability of free time between the two groups. This study, along with others on the compact city, shows that there are other reasons to reduce daily commuting distances in cities and the need of urban time policies to redesign urban society's temporal dimension besides the known environmental impacts. It also raises the question of how low urban density affects people's time and disposition to participate in public life.","Pilia, Margherita Valle","Fonseca, Franklin Ramirez",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,CITIES,Public space,Urban sprawl,Compact city,Urban form,Civic engagement,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 2024,"The influence of the urban model on civic involvement and public time.

It focuses on the distinct noise patterns of multirotor aircraft across various flight phases from static to dynamic tests. The proposed eVTOL UAM prototype features a lightweight carbon-fiber-reinforced structure with a total all-up weight of 110 kg, including a payload capacity of 50 kg. The study uses a 3-D approach to analyze the different vibrational and acoustic behaviors of eVTOLs in these scenarios. It delves into how noise is created and spread, particularly from rotor blades, emphasizing tonal and broadband noise. The research employs experimental analysis involving accelerometers, microphones, and tachometers for detailed tracking of vibrations and noise levels within the aircraft's structure. The noise spectrum data show its main features; the dominant noise levels were observed in low frequencies up to 800 Hz, between 6 and 7 kHz, and around 9 kHz. In addition, the vibrational analysis reveals that the dominant natural frequency is observed to be at 200 Hz.

Controlling visitors from the central prefectures of metropolitan areas was effective in mitigating infection spread in the surrounding prefectures during all phases. These results suggest that the local spread of infection can be mitigated by focusing on nighttime human mobility control in downtown areas before the epidemic spreads widely and transmission routes become more diverse, and that the geospatial spread of infection can be prevented by controlling the flows of people from large cities to other areas.","Nagata, Shohei","Takahashi, Yuta","Adachi, Hiroki M.","Johnson, Glen D.","Nakaya, Tomoki",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 6 2024,Local effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions on mitigation of COVID-19 spread through decreased human mobilities in Japan: a prefecture-level mediation analysis

Row_87,"The dramatic experience due to COVID-19 spread has reshaped travel preferences of public transport (PT) users worldwide, especially in urban areas. As the PT is expected to recover its major role in such areas, it is important to understand the factors influencing PT users' willingness to pay (WTP) for onboard safety measures, in the event of future pandemic scenarios. Furthermore, both individual latent traits (e.g. concern for the pandemic, trust/distrust in city services and national government actions) and perceived entity of the pandemic are expected to influence preferences for PT users under such a post-pandemic scenario. This paper analyses the preferences and attitudes of PT users in the Naples metropolitan area (Italy) through a hybrid choice model (HCM). First, WTPs for onboard service features are assessed in three hypothetical pandemic alert scenarios, which are explicitly introduced in the model as context variables. Second, the model allows for assessing the relative importance of onboard characteristics as the pandemic scenario evolves. Third, the model incorporates psycho-attitudinal variables and shows how they impact WTPs. Finally, several policy implications for policymakers and transport companies operating in the study area are derived. In particular: (a) WTPs for increased/reduced occupancy rate and green pass check at the entrance significantly depend upon the latent traits investigated; (b) relative importance of safety measures varies significantly between the pandemic alert scenarios; (c) possible ticketing strategies for PT users have been investigated based on the HCM findings, searching for the configuration of safety measures to ensure that users accept a 100% allowed capacity on board during moderate/high pandemic scenarios without varying the price, as well as the price variations needed to stay in an indifference range of the utility in restricted conditions of the service; (d) the acceptability of safety measures has been assessed through a simulation exercise, finding that non-vaccinated travellers are 2.6 and 2.1 times more willing to accept a full capacity of the buses/trains on board than vaccinated people if subscribers or not, respectively.","Tinessa, Fiore","Garcia, Concepcion Roman","Simonelli, Fulvio","Papola, Andrea","Pagliara, Francesca",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,Discrete choice,Error component logit,Hybrid choice model,COVID-19,Public transport,Post-pandemic,Post-vaccination,optimal ticket,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,How public transport users would react to different pandemic alert scenarios in the post-vaccine era?

However, accurate prediction and successful traffic management rely on reliable traffic information, which may not always be available due to the deployment and management costs of a specialized traffic intensity sensor infrastructure. We investigate the possibility of collecting alternative data sources and employing data fusion methodologies to build usable measurements. Hence, in this research, we focus on leveraging artificial intelligence techniques, data fusion, and synthetic sensing, to improve the accuracy of traffic flow prediction in regions with limited sensor infrastructure. The considered alternative measurements are source-destination datasets (e.g., those provided by mobile maps providers), meteorological data, bus trajectory information, and path and delay, obtained from metropolitan transport service providers. By fusing and analyzing these data sources, it becomes possible to predict traffic flow in a specific and localized area.

Similar to Census reports on the urban-rural wealth gap (Shrider et al. in Income and poverty in the United States: 2020. United States Census Bureau. Washington, DC. https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2021/demo/p60-273.html, 2021), OLS regression results indicate that rural respondents tend to report significantly less income than their nonrural peers, however, there is significant variation by nativity status, racial/ethnic background, and regional location. On average, foreign-born respondents, racial/ethnic minorities, and respondents located in the South report lower household incomes than their peers. Racial/ethnic background has a greater influence on household income than does nativity status, however, especially in rural areas. Race/ethnicity also moderates the effects of nativity status, although somewhat differently depending on metropolitan location and region. Predicted estimates of household income by nativity and race/ethnicity show that, regardless of race/ethnicity, foreign-born individuals in urban areas tend to have household incomes that are slightly lower than or similar to those of their same-race U.S.-born peers, with the exception of Black immigrants, those who report having two or more races, and respondents who belong to the Other Race category who tend to have higher incomes. In rural areas, however, substantively meaningful nativity differentials in income are only apparent for Black respondents.","Sparkman, Rachel","Tillman, Kathryn Harker",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,POPULATION RESEARCH AND POLICY REVIEW,Immigration,Race/ethnicity,Rural America,Household income,Region,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 2024,Household Income by Nativity Status and Race/Ethnicity Across Metropolitan and Regional Contexts
Row_91,"This study aims to identify the potential determinants of people's willingness to adopt autonomous vehicle (AV) taxis, with or without a backup driver, using Binary Logistic Regression in combination with the enhanced Random Forest attribute selection method. The results indicate that young men with frequent use of ride-sharing services, walk frequently, and have household incomes of approximately $150,000 - $200,000 are more likely to be interested in using AV taxis regardless of the presence of a backup driver. The study finds that previous travel habits (use of different modes) can greatly influence individuals' interest levels in using AV taxis. The study points AV taxi service providers should address female passengers' concerns to pursue a larger market. This study innovatively uses individuals' preferences for their residential locations, such as proximity to workplace, walkability, and affordability. Through the inclusion of these variables in the analysis, this study offers a more comprehensive insight into the potential users of AV taxis, thus enabling policymakers and planners to pursue a transportation system that is sustainable, equitable, and responsive to the diverse needs and preferences of different populations. The study has limitations in that it lacks users' perceived benefits and their specific needs pertaining to AVs. Finally, the study emphasizes the importance of examining the causes of inequality and promoting equitable access to AV technology, particularly for vulnerable groups.","Wang, Jun","Dunham-Jones, Ellen","Akar, Gulsah",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,CASE STUDIES ON TRANSPORT POLICY,Shared autonomous vehicle,Mobility modes,Travel Behavior,AV taxi,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2024,Exploring the influence of driver's presence on passengers' willingness level to take autonomous taxis - Evidence from Seattle metropolitan area

This study investigates TTV metrics within the context of shared mobility using probe data from transportation network companies (TNCs) in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Dallas-Fort Worth. Eight reliability metrics are analyzed and compared for each origin-destination (OD) pair in the network, including standard deviation (SD), the Planning Time Index (PTI), the Travel Time Index (TTI), the Buffer Index (BI), On-time Measures PR (alpha), and the Misery Index (MI), to evaluate their effectiveness in clustering OD pairs using K-means clustering. The findings confirm that SD, PTI, and MI are particularly effective in measuring travel time reliability and clustering within urban systems. This study identifies the most unbalanced supply-demand OD pairs/regions in each city, noting that low/medium-SD clusters around metropolitan airports indicate stable travel times even in high-demand zones, while high-SD clusters in downtown areas reveal significant traffic demands and unreliability. These patterns become more pronounced in study areas with multiple city centers.

This paper explores the spatial distribution of well-being and its relationship to various forms of residential segregation. External well-being indices are obtained for Swedish individuals through register data. The mean well-being of 13 scales of bespoke neighbourhoods is classified into 12 clusters. Similar to previous findings, a strongly polarised pattern of neighbourhood well-being is found. Neighbourhood well-being is found to strongly correlate with more traditional measures of segregation. Areas in cities found in more traditional segregation studies have lower well-being. Half of the working population lives in areas that have homogenised levels of well-being; 14% live in a well-being-deprived neighbourhood. Low-scoring areas are deprived in most well-being dimensions, while middle and high-scoring neighbourhoods vary in the domains they excel in. The paper is one of the first to connect segregation studies to explore the causes of the spatial sorting of well-being.

Row_95,"Highlights What are the main findings? Results show that private car indexes for mobility, competitiveness and accessibility are higher than those of public transport. Significant variability in performance indicators among city areas are identified, indicating inequalities in social and environmental sustainability in urban systems. What are the implications of the main findings? Policy actions need to be tailored to the specific area of the city based on quantitative evidence. Strategies need to consider multiple dimensions to effectively support the use of public transport.Abstract The transport sector worldwide relies heavily on oil products, and private cars account for the largest share of passenger mobility in several countries. Public transport could represent an interesting alternative under many perspectives, including a decrease in traffic, pollutants, and climate emissions. However, for public transport to succeed, it should be attractive for final users, representing a viable alternative to private mobility. In this work, we analyse the spatial distribution of public transport service provision within two metropolitan cities, considering the three key dimensions of mobility, competitiveness, and accessibility of public transport. The results show that private car performs better than public transport in all scopes considered, and that performance indicators are highly variable among city areas, indicating inequalities in social and environmental sustainability in urban systems. The outcomes of the analysis provide interesting insights for policy makers and researchers that deal with similar topics, and can also be extended to other cities and countries.","Zini, Alessandro","Roberto, Roberta","Corrias, Patrizia","Felici, Bruna","Noussan, Michel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,SMART CITIES,urban mobility,public transport,accessibility,equity,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,Accessibility Measures to Evaluate Public Transport Competitiveness: The Case of Rome and Turin

The urban case study area is the large metropolitan region of the West Midlands, UK, but the approach is generalizable and translatable to other global urban regions. The new approach of GeoSpatial and Temporal Mapping of Urban Mobility (GeoSTMUM) is used to convert telematics data into driving metrics, including the relative time the vehicle fleet spends idling, cruising, accelerating, and decelerating. The telematics data is also used to parameterize driving volatility and aggressiveness, which are key factors within road safety, which is a global issue. Two approaches to defining aggressive driving are applied and assessed, they are vehicle jerk (the second derivative of vehicle speed), and the profile of speed versus acceleration/deceleration. The telematics-based approach has a very high spatial resolution (15-150 m) and temporal resolution (2 h), which can be used to develop more accurate driving cycles. The approach allows for the determination of road segments with the highest potential for aggressive driving and highlights where additional safety measures could beneficially be adopted. Results highlight the strong correlation between vehicle road occupancy and aggressive driving.","Xiang, Junjun","Ghaffarpasand, Omid","Pope, Francis D.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 8 2024,Mapping urban mobility using vehicle telematics to understand driving behaviour

However, in densely populated regions like Alexandria, characterized by high population density and limited road infrastructure, accessibility to diverse transportation options is crucial.Methods This study investigates the accessibility of public transportation modes, including railways and buses, and their interaction with informal transit. Questioning if public transportation alone will be sufficient for pedestrians or if the presence of informal transit is crucial, and whether all residents of Alexandria have their rightful accessibility for different transport modes, the goal was to establish an efficient and interconnected transportation network. A survey was conducted in cooperation with Transport for Cairo to investigate all transport routes throughout Alexandria, further using ArcGIS Pro to identify gaps in public transportation coverage.Results Findings revealed that public transportation alone is insufficient due to limited bus and railway coverage because of their fixed linear routes. Informal transit, like microbuses, plays a vital role in filling these gaps.Discussion The study emphasizes the need for a comprehensive and sustainable transportation network that considers both formal and informal transit.

Row_98,"The escalating frequency, duration, and intensity of extreme heat events have posed a significant threat to human society in recent decades. Understanding the dynamic patterns of human mobility under extreme heat will contribute to accurately assessing the risk of extreme heat exposure. This study leverages an emerging geospatial data source, anonymous cell phone location data, to investigate how people in different communities adapt travel behaviors responding to extreme heat events. Taking the Greater Houston Metropolitan Area as an example, we develop two indices, the Mobility Disruption Index (MDI) and the Activity Time Shift Index (ATSI), to quantify diurnal mobility changes and activity time shift patterns at the city and intra-urban scales. The results reveal that human mobility decreases significantly in the daytime of extreme heat events in Houston while the proportion of activity after 8 p.m. is increased, accompanied with a delay in travel time in the evening. Moreover, these mobility-decreasing and activity-delaying effects exhibited substantial spatial heterogeneity across census block groups. Causality analysis using the Geographical Convergent Cross Mapping (GCCM) model combined with correlation analyses indicates that people in areas with a high proportion of minorities and poverty are less able to adopt heat adaptation strategies to avoid the risk of heat exposure. These findings highlight the fact that besides the physical aspect of environmental justice on heat exposure, the inequity lies in the population's capacity and knowledge to adapt to extreme heat. This research is the first of the kind that quantifies multi-level mobility for extreme heat responses, and sheds light on a new facade to plan and implement heat mitigations and adaptation strategies beyond the traditional approaches.","Tian, Hao","Cai, Heng","Hu, Leiqiu","Qiang, Yi","Zhou, Bing","Yang, Mingzheng","Lin, Binbin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,Heatwave,Human mobility,Adaptation strategies,Urban resilience,Heat resilience,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 2024,Unveiling community adaptations to extreme heat events using mobile phone location data
Row_99,"Aging at home is a trajectory that governments have been promoting for many years, and that seniors and their families appreciate. However, aging at home is not a static or linear experience. As people's lives evolve, so do their neighbourhoods, placing individuals in different situations, more or less favourable from the point of view of inclusion, participation and, more broadly, control of their residential environment. This dual evolution is particularly visible in the immigrant areas of metropolitan agglomerations like Montr & eacute;al. The environments in which both immigration and aging are concentrated vary widely in terms of urban form (inner-city, peri-urban, suburbs, etc.) and urban dynamics (renewal, requalification, gentrification, etc.). These differentiated dynamics sometimes correspond to favoured areas that may be experiencing impoverishment, and sometimes refer to areas undergoing relatively significant social and economic change, posing challenges for urban policies that are just as challenging. Using the concept of residential normalcy, we look at 3 types of living environments (established immigrant communities, requalifying communities, and sprawled immigrant communities). Seniors achieve residential normalcy when they report generally positive feelings about their living environments, the people, groups or institutions that shape their daily lives, and the activities they are able to choose and carry out. Many of the factors that exclude established immigrant communities are related to access to urban resources, particularly institutional recognition. If access to mobility and transportation is a factor of fragility, to be able to follow the trajectory of the community of belonging in the agglomeration, the anchoring of the community of belonging in its environment is a strong factor of inclusion. For areas undergoing redevelopment or sprawling, it's the very location and presence of urban resources that raises questions, giving visibility to individuals and communities. This issue of (in)visibility involves a number of ordinary places (shopping centres, vacant spaces of all kinds, etc.), but these are undergoing major transformation, and their control is not guaranteed.

Row_100,"Flexible public transport is defined as a future mobility solution that adapts to user needs and the fluctuating demand patterns that mainly appear in rural areas. However, the temporal variations in traveler preferences for flexible bus services remain largely unexplored in existing research. This constrains the realization of adaptive and customized solutions. Therefore, this study attempts to develop a distinct method for strategic planning of a flexible bus service. To this end, a combinatorial method is undertaken: quantitative social research (questionnaires) and spatial analysis. This combinatorial approach is applied at Korinth and Loutraki in Greece, two significant rural areas neighboring the Athens Metropolitan Area. The results signify that cost and time are the most crucial factors affecting the use of a flexible service. Furthermore, respondents preferred a door-to-door service in the morning and a stop-based service in the afternoon/evening. Concerning route planning, eight routes with different purposes are suggested (e.g., train feeder, touristic, etc.) covering adequately both urban and rural parts of the study area.

To diagnose the lesion area, otologists typically assess ossicular mobility through intraoperative palpation. Quantification of ossicular mobility and evidence-based diagnostic criteria are necessary for accurate assessment of each pathology, because diagnosis via palpation can rely on the surgeons' experiences and skills. In this study, ossicular mobilities were simulated in 92 pathological cases of ossicular fixation as compliances using a finite-element (FE) model of the human middle ear. The validity of the ossicular mobilities obtained from the FE model was verified by comparison with measurements of ossicular mobilities in cadavers using our newly developed intraoperative ossicular mobility measurement system. The fixation-induced changes in hearing were validated by comparison with changes in the stapedial velocities obtained from the FE model with measurements reported in patients and in temporal bones. The 92 cases were classified into four groups by conducting a cluster analysis based on the simulated ossicular compliances. Most importantly, the cases of combined fixation of the malleus and/or the incus with otosclerosis were classified into two different surgical procedure groups by degree of fixation, i.e., malleo-stapedotomy and stapedotomy. These results suggest that pathological characteristics can be detected using quantitatively measured ossicular compliances followed by cluster analysis, and therefore, an effective diagnosis of ossicular fixation is achievable.","Lee, Sinyoung","You, Hyeonsik","Morita, Yoji","Kanzaki, Sho","Zhao, Fei","Koike, Takuji",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Ossiculoplasty,Finite-element model,Cluster analysis,Palpation,Middle ear transfer function,Otosclerosis,,,,,,,,,,SEP 3 2024,Classification of ossicular fixation based on a computational simulation of ossicular mobility

Row_106,"The urban built environment, comprising structures, roads, and various facilities, plays a key role in the formation of urban heat islands, which inflict considerable damage upon human society. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in urban areas characterized by the rapid growth and concentration of populations, a global trend, notably exemplified in megacities such as Bangkok, Thailand. The global trend of urbanization has witnessed unprecedented growth in recent decades, with cities transforming into megametropolises that profoundly impact changes in urban temperature, specifically the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon induced by the rapid growth of urban areas. Elevated urban concentrations lead to increased city density, contributing to higher temperatures within the urban environment compared to the surrounding areas. The evolving land-use surface has assumed heightened significance due to urban development, necessitating accelerated efforts to mitigate urban heat islands. This study aims to quantify the influence of urban growth on urban surface temperature in Bangkok and its surrounding areas. The inverse relationship between urban temperature and land surface temperature (LST), coupled with urban area density, was examined using Landsat 5 and 8 satellite imagery. The analysis revealed a positive correlation between higher temperatures and levels of urban growth. Areas characterized by high-rise structures and economic activities experienced the most pronounced impact of the heat island phenomenon. The city exhibited a notable correlation between high density and high temperatures (high-high), signifying that increased density contributes to elevated temperatures due to heat dissipation (significant correlation of R2 = 0.8582). Conversely, low-temperature, low-density cities (low-low) with a dispersed layout demonstrated effective cooling of the surrounding area, resulting in a significant correlation with lower local temperatures (R2 = 0.7404). These findings provide valuable insights to assist governments and related agencies in expediting planning and policy development aimed at reducing heat in urban areas and steering sustainable urban development.","Iamtrakul, Pawinee","Padon, Apinya","Chayphong, Sararad",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,,ATMOSPHERE,urban densification,urban growth,urban heat islands,megacity,temperature,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2024,"Quantifying the Impact of Urban Growth on Urban Surface Heat Islands in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region, Thailand"

For any travel mode, the distributions of normalized travel time for different years (1968-2008) and distances to the city center converge to a curve, although the average travel time and share of travel modes vary. By employing the concept of utility, we developed a disaggregate model wherein an individual maximizes utility from traveling (=benefit - cost) by modifying daily travel time. This model theoretically explained the observed distributions of travel time. The model was further used to demonstrate travel mode choices. The model parameters were estimated using the distribution of travel time, travel mode share, and manageable assumptions. These results provided interesting interpretations of the perceptual utility of the daily travel time of a population. Moreover, the obtained curves of utility versus time are similar to the shapes of the overall benefits assumed in previous studies.

The survey responses were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The results show that more than one-third of respondents would consider relocating. The willingness to relocate was marginally influenced by socioeconomic factors and flood experiences and instead was significantly correlated with the risk of disastrous flooding, inadequate insurance compensation, and worsening crime. However, data show a clear shift in relocation support and the distance of the preferred destination from minor to significant flooding.

Row_112,"The scope of the research work described in this article involved identifying the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the urban public transport system in a medium-sized city and its adjacent metropolitan area, using as reference information the number of tickets effectively sold in order to determine the fluctuation in the volume of passengers on the different bus lines before, during and after the pandemic. At the methodological level, a combined approach was employed, involving, on the one hand, the collection of open access public data from institutional repositories and information provided by the government and, on the other hand, network analysis and graphical mapping using GIS tools. The results obtained at the micro level (individualised study of each urban bus line) reveal a significant decrease in the number of passengers during the pandemic, showing the effect of mobility restrictions and the fear of contagion. However, a gradual recovery in post-pandemic demand has been observed, highlighting a large variability in recovery patterns between different bus lines. Such a situation could be attributable to several factors, such as the socio-demographic characteristics of the areas served, the frequency of the service, connectivity with other modes of transport and users' perception of the quality of the service. At the macro level (comparison between urban and interurban transport), lines with higher demand prior to the pandemic have shown greater resilience and faster recovery. However, urban transport has experienced a more uniform and accelerated recuperation than interurban transport, with significant percentage differences in the years analysed. This disparity could be explained by the greater dependence of inhabitants on urban transport for their daily trips, due to its greater frequency and geographical coverage. Interurban transport, on the other hand, shows a more fluctuating demand and a lower dependence of users. Finally, the lack of previous research focused on the impact of the pandemic in sparsely populated rural areas restricts the ability to establish a solid frame of reference and generalise the results of this study. The authors consider that more detailed future research, including a comparative analysis of different alternative transport modes in inter-urban settings and considering a broader set of socio-demographic variables of passengers, is needed to better understand mobility dynamics in these areas and their evolution in the context of the pandemic.","Gonzalez-Escobar, Rafael","Naranjo, Juan Miguel Vega","Jimenez-Espada, Montana","Vivas, Jonathan Galeano",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,SUSTAINABILITY,public bus transportation,rural areas,demographic challenge and depopulation,patterns of displacement mobility,COVID-19,GIS,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,Exploring the Footprint of COVID-19 on the Evolution of Public Bus Transport Demand Using GIS
Row_113,"Mercury cycling in coastal metropolitan areas on the west coast of India becomes complex due to the combined effects of both intensive domestic anthropogenic emissions and marine air masses. The present study is based on yearlong data of continuous measurements of gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) concentration concurrent with meteorological parameters and some air pollutants at a coastal urban site in Mumbai, on the west coast of India, for the first time. The concentration of GEM was found in a range between 2.2 and 12.3 ng/m(3), with a mean of 3.1 +/- 1.1 ng/m(3), which was significantly higher than the continental background values in the Northern Hemisphere (similar to 1.5 ng/m(3)). Unlike particulates, GEM starts increasing post-winter to peak during the monsoon and decrease towards winter. July had the highest concentration of GEM followed by October, and a minimum in January. GEM exhibited a distinct diurnal cycle, mainly with a broad peak in the early morning, a narrow one by nightfall, and a minimum in the afternoon. The peaks and their timing suggest the origin of urban mobility and the start of local activities. A positive correlation between SO2, PM2.5, temperature, relative humidity, and GEM indicates that emissions from local industrial plants in the Mumbai coastal area. Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) confirm this fact. Monthly back trajectory analysis showed that air mass flows are predominantly from the Arabian Sea and local human activities. Assessment of human health risks by USEPA model reveals that the hazardous quotient, HQ < 1, implies negligible carcinogenic risk. GEM observations in Mumbai during the study period are below the World Health Organization's (WHO) safe limit (200 ng/m(3)) for long-term inhalation.","Rao, M.

In terms of accessibility, they allow more people to travel safely, regardless of age, physical condition, or pur- chasing power. Additionally, bike lanes contribute to sustainable development. This study investigates the impact of bike lanes on mobility in major avenues of Recife, Brazil, focusing on changes in average speeds and travel times before and after their implementation. The analysis was conducted on eight traffic corridors using historical data. The results show that average speeds decreased after the introduction of bike lanes, especially during peak hours. However, this reduction aligns with road safety guidelines, creating a safer environment for cyclists and pedestrians. Regarding travel times, the difference between using a car and a bicycle is minimal outside peak hours. It can be concluded that the impacts in terms of speed and travel time are minimal, which reinforces the need for expanding bike lanes in a metropolitan area.","Nunes, Iago Santana","Meira, Leonardo Herszon",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,REVISTA DE TRANSPORTE Y TERRITORIO,CYCLING ROUTES,URBAN MOBILITY,TRAVEL TIME,ROAD SPEED,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL-DEC 2024,"The impact of cycling routes on travel time and speed on major avenues in Recife, Brazil"

Methods: A national sample of 2,067 Canadian parents of 7- to 12-year-old children was recruited in December 2020. Regression analyses were used in 2023 to assess the association between geographic information system measures of park density, blue space, population density, greenspace, intersection density, and CIM and AST to and from school. Results: Children in areas with high versus low park density (>0.025 vs. <= 0.025) had higher odds of travel to school via active modes (OR: 1.47 [1.14, 1.91], p=0.003). Children in neighborhoods in the highest quartile for neighborhood greenspace (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) were more likely to travel to home actively than those in areas of lower greenspace (OR: 1.70 [1.18, 2.45], p=0.004). On average, children living in areas in the highest versus the lowest quartile for intersection density were more likely to engage in AST to (OR: 2.43 [1.58, 3.75], p<0.001) and from (OR: 2.77 [1.80, 4.29], p<0.001) school. Conclusions: The observed associations underscore a need for city planners and policymakers to ensure sufficient access to parks and neighborhood greenspace, especially if findings are confirmed in longitudinal studies.

We analyzed the data collected from bike-share systems of five major Brazilian cities to investigate the aspects of cycling behavior in terms of gender. Additionally, we examined the uneven access to cycling infrastructure, considering its socio-spatial inequalities. The obtained results confirm the lack of female bike-sharing cyclists at different levels. The gender difference decreased for bike-share trips with longer durations and recreational purposes. In seaside towns, women represented a higher participation percentage in bike-share cycling, particularly in recreational areas such as parks, seafronts, and lakesides. Although cycle lanes reduced the disparity, they did not ensure the gender balance as observed in recreational areas. The proportion of female bike-share cyclists reduced in areas lacking cycle lanes and near metro-rail stations.

Row_118,"The increasing use of heavy vehicles for services such as public transport, waste collection and logistics in densely populated urban areas causes numerous collisions with serious consequences every year, particularly for pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) have proven to be a solution because they can significantly reduce the occurrence and consequences of road crashes. Although many ADAS technologies will be mandatory on new trucks in 2024, it will take more than a decade before the benefits are realised due to the average fleet renewal time. To accelerate this process, the most promising solution is therefore the introduction of aftermarket ADAS (also referred to as 'retrofit' ADAS) on the circulating fleet. This study aims to identify a tailored solution for retrofitting ADAS capable of providing pedestrian collision warnings on heavy vehicle fleets currently circulating in urban areas. The study involves a sample of vehicles and drivers operating in the metropolitan areas of Florence and Pistoia for waste collection services. The company owner of the vehicles integrated a commercial camera-based ADAS system with three additional cameras installed on the frontal bumper and edges of the vehicle, linked with three screens positioned in the vehicle cabin. In this study, a field test campaign was performed integrating trials in a proving ground closed to traffic with testing and monitoring in urban areas. This allowed to define a set of recommended parameters depending on vehicle speed that represent a good balance between alert frequency, minimizing false positives and ensuring that the alerts indicate real potential hazards to the driver. The recommendations provided in this study can also be extended to other vehicle fleets so that rapid and substantial improvements in the safety of heavy vehicles operating in cities can be achieved.","Lucci, Cosimo","Pierini, Marco","Savino, Giovanni",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,"52ND CONFERENCE ON ENGINEERING MECHANICAL DESIGN AND STRESS ANALYSIS, AIAS 2023",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024,"Retrofitting pedestrian and cyclist collision warning for improved safety of heavy trucks employed in urban areas: a case study in Florence and Pistoia, Italy"

Using a fully parametric hazard-based duration model with random parameters, we address data heterogeneity and uncover how different conditions affect bike-share trips. Our findings reveal that (a) intense environmental factors such as high traffic stress, poor weather, and high COVID-19 risk levels are associated with shorter trip durations; (b) in contrast, supportive initiatives like memberships, an affordable USD 5 Access Pass, a free one-month pass during the pandemic, and the introduction of new stations are more likely to encourage longer rides; (c) variables like gym closures due to the pandemic, evening hours, and the addition of new stations, which were set as random variables in our model, exhibit both positive and negative relationships with ride durations. A key finding is the 20-minute mark in ride durations, which helps understand user behaviors and trip purposes. This insight aids urban planning by suggesting strategic bike station placements to enhance bike-share system efficiency and meet diverse community needs. Moreover, the pandemic and related policy responses have clearly impacted user behaviors, showing the necessity for adaptable urban transportation strategies in response to external crises.

Row_124,"With the advent of new mobility modes and technologies, we have seen meaningful changes in travel behavior. One such new mobility mode is on-demand transit. The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority deployed its own on-demand transit system, dubbed MARTA Reach, in March of 2022. This paper provides an evaluation of the characteristics of two groups of people related to MARTA Reach: those who were interested in it and used it and those who were interested in it but did not use it. In addition, this paper explores the factors that influence membership in each of those two groups using a binary logit model, revealing the underlying characteristics that are linked with the decision to use or not use the service given prior interest. The findings show that simply providing more service has the strongest effect on adoption. Among 561 survey respondents, 426 expressed that the service area for MARTA Reach was too limited for their needs. Modeling results support this finding, in addition to the following strong predictors of on-demand transit adoption: 1) being a frequent transit user, 2) being satisfied with the current state of fixed-route transit service, 3) being part of a low-income household, 4) living within an on-demand transit service area, and 5) being younger.

This study quantifies the change in personal vehicle ownership and total miles driven by TNC drivers in three metropolitan areas: San Francisco, CA; Los Angeles, CA; and Washington, D.C. The data sources for this analysis comprise two surveys, one for TNC passengers (N = 8630) and one for TNC drivers (N = 5034), in addition to data provided by the TNC operators Uber and Lyft. The passenger survey was deployed within the three metropolitan areas in July and August 2016, while the driver survey was deployed from October to November 2016. The TNC operator data corresponded with these time frames and informed the distance driven by vehicles, passenger frequency of use, and fleet level fuel economies. The data from these sources were analyzed to estimate the impact of TNCs on travel behavior, personal vehicle ownership and associated VMT changes, as well as the VMT of TNCs, including app-off driving. These impacts were scaled to the population level and collectively evaluated to determine the net impacts of TNCs on VMT and GHG emissions using fuel economy factors. The results showed that the presence of TNCs led to a net increase of 234 and 242 miles per passenger per year, respectively, in Los Angeles and San Francisco, while yielding a net decrease of 83 miles per passenger per year in Washington, D.C.

The compelled mobility approach emphasizes the uneven distribution of organizational and institutional resources across urban space, expecting residents of poor Black-segregated neighborhoods to exhibit non-trivial levels of everyday exposure to White, non-poor areas for resource seeking. We use two sets of location data in the hypersegregated Chicago metro to examine these two approaches: Global Positioning System (GPS) location tracking on a sample of older adults from the Chicago Health and Activity Space in Real-Time (CHART) study and travel diaries on a sample of younger adults by the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP). We introduce a novel and flexible individual-level method for assessing activity space exposures that accounts for the spatially proximate environment around home. Analyses reveal that activity space contexts mimic the racial/ethnic and socio-economic landscape of respondents' broad residential environment. However, after residential-based adjustment, Black younger (CMAP) adults from poor Black neighborhoods are disproportionately exposed to Whiter, less Black but less non-poor neighborhoods. Older (CHART) adult activity spaces align more closely with their residential areas; however, activity spaces of poor-Black-neighborhood-residing CHART Blacks are systematically poorer and, less consistently, more Black and less White after local area adjustment.

This assumption holds in metropolitan contexts, where central areas offer better accessibility and are associated with higher levels of PT use. In metropolitan peripheries, a large part of commuting is done on an interurban basis, so that the level of use of public transit can be linked to the supply and information available.

Row_130,"Research on the geography of metropolitan opportunities has focused on a set of opportunities in different urban areas over time to justify policy interventions. The Beijing government implemented large-scale policy interventions to achieve structural industrial changes in order to stop the downward spiral of poverty and segregation in ""urban villages."" Beijing has accelerated the redevelopment of urban villages and helped tens of thousands of low-wage migrant workers in garment villages move to surrounding secondary cities or small towns in Hebei Province with better opportunities. However, low-wage migrant workers did not respond linearly to the intervention. This study analyzes the reasons underlying the response of low-wage migrant workers to these policy interventions. First, the antipoverty policy is a geographic exercise, moving low-end industries from a global center to peripheral locations. This study considers why this mobility strategy for improving opportunity has become the arena for opportunistic behavior and conceptualizes the logic of opportunism and the self-worth of low-wage migrant workers in a metropolitan area. Second, the Beijing government is attempting to disperse the low-end informal industries into formal industrial bases in Hebei. Dispersal campaigns inevitably involve circuitous mobility and the outcome of dispersal is inherently unstable. One of the crucial questions in dispersal strategies is scale. Would an upscaled Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) City Region or a downscaled ""neighborhood effect"" better implement the antipoverty strategy? This dispersal strategy can break up the concentration of migrants, but their perceived opportunities remain in Beijing. One of the obstacles to the full implementation of the dispersal strategy is grassroots opposition. This study uses a three-year survey conducted prior to the COVID-19 lockdown to analyze how displaced migrant workers perceive these opportunities in their processual and networked decision-making. Garment villages are important ""anchor places"" where migrants can mobilize their social capital and facilitate upward mobility outside a dominant institution in Beijing. This study reveals how garment workers replicated informal habitats in more remote locations in Beijing as the old habitats disappeared.","Liu, Ran","Huang, Xu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,CITIES,Geography of opportunity (GO),Migrants,Value,Urban village,Beijing -Tianjin -Hebei (BTH),Garment industry,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2024,"Changing value system, shifting geography of opportunity: Trajectory of migrant workers in the garment industry in Beijing"

As this new infrastructure would undoubtedly change the traffic network, there is a need for more understanding of its potential safety impact. Unfortunately, many advanced real-time crash prediction models encounter an important challenge in their applicability due to their demand for a substantial volume of data for direct modeling. To tackle this challenge, we proposed a simple yet effective approach - anomaly detection learning, which formulates model as an anomaly detection problem, solves it through normality feature recognition, and predicts crashes by identifying deviations from the normal state. The proposed approach demonstrates significant improvement in the Area Under the Curve (AUC), sensitivity, and False Alarm Rate (FAR). When juxtaposed with the prevalent direct classification paradigm, our proposed anomaly detection learning (ADL) consistently outperforms in AUC (with an increase of up to 45%), sensitivity (experiencing up to a 45% increase), and FAR (reducing by up to 0.53). The most performance gain is attained through the combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) in an ensemble, resulting in a 0.78 AUC, 0.79 sensitivity, and a 0.22 false alarm rate. Furthermore, we analyzed model features with a game-theoretic approach illustrating the most correlated features for accurate prediction, revealing the attention of advanced convolution neural networks to occupancy features.

This leads to higher commuter costs, immobility, transport and time poverty, pollution, higher accident rates and a lack of social interactions. To offer sustainable mobility options to citizens, we must comprehensively understand, together with their individual characteristics, their specific mobility practices and the built environment where they live. This study is centred on the Barcelona Metropolitan Region, which has a public transport network that covers its entire area. The aim of this study is to examine the relationships between travel behaviour, transport mode use, individual characteristics and built environment characteristics in the place of residence using detailed information sources. Herein, we used data from the 2018 to 2021 annual travel survey conducted in the Barcelona region, together with land use and sociodemographic information. Our findings suggest that transport policies have encouraged sustainable mobility practices, particularly in the centre of Barcelona. Despite the positive results, considerable disparities exist between the inner and outer city, with a notable decline in sustainable mobility practices in the latter, due to the uneven distribution of basic services and uneven provision of public transport, together with lower density areas. Our results demonstrate that this uneven distribution reduces the available sequence profiles of inhabitants. In conclusion, the promotion of sustainable mobility policies necessitates further advances in transport, city and land-use planning that consider equity, gender, the socioeconomic profiles of citizens and mixed urban planning.","Montero, Lidia","Mejia-Dorantes, Lucia","Barcelo, Jaume",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,SUSTAINABILITY,travel behaviour,sequence analysis,equity,clustering,spatial analysis,gender,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,"Land Use, Travel Patterns and Gender in Barcelona: A Sequence Analysis Approach"
Row_133,"The main purpose of this paper is to show how a direct demand ride model coupled with a transfer model was able to support the choice of alternative routes for the expansion of the light rail system serving the Porto Metropolitan Area. After an overview of the literature on direct ridership models, emphasizing some key issues such as the need for a systematic assessment of their forecasting performance, the issues related to the definition of the pedestrian catchment area and the limitations of the simultaneous consideration of demand and supply effects, the paper moves into the case study, providing some background information on current occupation densities, land uses and mobility patterns, as well as on the performance of the existing LRT in the Metropolitan Area of Porto. The development of the direct ridership model, measuring the potential attractiveness of each station, and the transfer model, measuring the number of transfers at each station, are presented in detail. A justification is provided why, in this case, a two-step modelling approach was necessary. Further details about the statistical tests for model validation are also provided. After a brief characterization of the alternative routes under analysis for the expansion of the network, the modelling results are presented enabling a comparative assessment of the potential performance of each proposed route.

Row_134,"Objectives:To identify what transportation barriers pediatric patients face when traveling to a major metropolitan orthopaedic center, how these barriers affect care, and what changes can be made to address this issue. Study Design:A cross-sectional transportation survey was administered to 107 caregivers of patients being seen in the orthopaedic clinic at a tertiary children's hospital in a large metropolitan area. Using logistic regression analysis, we compared socioeconomic characteristics, transportation methods, and scheduling practices among caregivers who reported missing at least one visit in the past and those who reported never missing a visit. Results:13% (14/108) of caregivers reported missing one or more past visits due to late arrival or transportation issues. Families that traveled more than 45 minutes to clinic (P = 0.04), waited more than one week to schedule a visit (P = 0.002), or reported difficulty scheduling a visit (P = 0.02) were significantly more likely to have a history of nonattendance. In addition, patients who were nonambulatory (P = 0.007), used a mobility device (P = 0.007), or were non-White (P < 0.05) were significantly more likely to have missed a visit. Conclusion:Travel time, difficult or delayed scheduling, and patient ambulatory status were all associated with missing orthopaedic clinic visits although other socioeconomic factors were not related. Interventions to improve orthopaedic clinic attendance should focus on promoting accessibility for patients with mobility limitations and encouraging simple and timely scheduling practices.","Hauschild, Maia H.","Wren, Tishya A.

This assumption is problematic when applied to economic activities for which social stigma exists. In this article, we examine the influence of social stigma on the locational choices made by customers of illicit massage businesses in the DallasFort Worth, Texas metropolitan area. We introduce the concept of shame buffers - zones around the places to which each customer is most deeply socially embedded, their home, workplace, and other community spaces, where the customer would not engage in stigmatized behaviors for fear of being observed and facing social shaming. We then examine the validity of the shame-buffer concept by analyzing customers' mobility patterns for both legal and illicit massage businesses in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metropolitan Area (DFW metro).","Crotty, Sean M.","Zhou, Xiaolu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,APPLIED GEOGRAPHY,Illicit massage,Retail geography,Locational selection,Shame,Black market,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,Shame buffers and spatial risk-mitigation: Exploring the effects of social stigma on the locational strategies of illicit massage businesses and their customers
Row_136,"Introduction: Going out of the home is important for older people 's health. This study examined how staying at home was associated with population density and whether car ownership and public transport mediated the association. Methods: Data from 86,077 older adults who participated in the Sixth Greater Tokyo Metropolitan Area Household Travel Survey were used. We conducted multilevel logistic regression analyses to estimate the odds of staying at home (not reporting any travel on a survey day) by population density. Further analyses for the samples stratified by car ownership and public transport stop (PTS) density were conducted. Results: Staying at home was more common in low population density areas. Each additional 100 persons/ha was associated with a 15% lower odds ratio of staying at home. This association was moderated by PTS density score but not by car ownership. Population density was not significantly associated with staying at home in areas with high PTS density score (odds ratio [OR] = 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.93, 1.02), but low density was associated with a higher odds ratio in areas with lower PTS density score (OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.76, 0.85) and regardless of car ownership. Conclusions: Better access to public transport may protect older adults living in lower density areas from staying at home.

Row_137,"Over decades, many cities have been expanded and functionally diversified by population activities, socio-demographics and attributes of the built environment. Urban expansion and development have led to the emergence of spatial structures of cities. Uncovering cities' spatial structures is critical to understanding various urban phenomena such as segregation, equity of access, and sustainability. In this study, we propose using a neural embedding model-graph neural network (GNN)-that leverages the heterogeneous features of urban areas and their interactions captured by human mobility networks to obtain vector representations of these areas. Using large-scale high-resolution mobility data sets from millions of aggregated and anonymized mobile phone users in 16 metropolitan counties in the United States, we demonstrate that our embeddings encode complex relationships among features related to urban components (such as distribution of facilities) and population attributes and activities. The clustered representations of urban areas show the shared characteristics among urban areas in the same cluster. We show that embeddings generated by a model trained on a different county can capture 50% to 60% of the spatial structure in another county, allowing us to make cross-county comparisons and inferences. The findings reveal complex relationships among urban components in cities. Since the identified multifaceted spatial structures capture the combined effects of various mechanisms, such as segregation, disparate facility distribution, and human mobility, the findings could help identify the limitations of the current city structure to inform planning decisions and policies. Also, the model and findings set the stage for a variety of research in urban planning, engineering and social science through an integrated understanding of how the complex interactions between urban components and population activities and attributes shape the spatial structures in cities.","Fan, Chao","Yang, Yang","Mostafavi, Ali",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 14 2024,Neural embeddings of urban big data reveal spatial structures in cities
Row_138,"Environmental epidemiologic studies using geospatial data often estimate exposure at a participant's residence upon enrollment, but mobility during the exposure period can lead to misclassification. We aimed to mitigate this issue by constructing residential histories for participants in the California Teachers Study through follow-up (1995-2018). Address records have been collected from the US Postal Service, LexisNexis, Experian, and California Cancer Registry. We identified records of the same address based on geo-coordinate distance (<= 250 m) and street name similarity. We consolidated addresses, prioritizing those confirmed by participants during follow-up questionnaires, and estimating the duration lived at each address using dates associated with records (e.g., date-first-seen). During 23 years of follow-up, about half of participants moved (48%, including 14% out-of-state). We observed greater mobility among younger women, Hispanic/Latino women, and those in metropolitan and lower socioeconomic status areas. The cumulative proportion of in-state movers remaining eligible for analysis was 21%, 32%, and 41% at 5, 10, and 20 years post enrollment, respectively. Using self-reported information collected 10 years after enrollment, we correctly identified 94% of movers and 95% of non-movers as having moved or not moved from their enrollment address. This dataset provides a foundation for estimating long-term environmental exposures in diverse epidemiologic studies in this cohort.IMPACT:Our efforts in constructing residential histories for California Teachers Study participants through follow-up (1995-2018) benefit future environmental epidemiologic studies. Address availability during the exposure period can mitigate misclassification due to residential changes, especially when evaluating long-term exposures and chronic health outcomes. This can reduce differential misclassification among more mobile subgroups, including younger women and those from lower socioeconomic and urban areas. Our approach to consolidating addresses from multiple sources showed high accuracy in comparison to self-reported residential information. The residential dataset produced from this analysis provides a valuable tool for future studies, ultimately enhancing our understanding of environmental health impacts.","Medgyesi, Danielle N.","Spielfogel, Emma S.","Ward, Mary H.","Jones, Rena R.","Savage, Kristen E.","Benbow, Jennifer L.","Lacey, James V.","Sanchez, Tiffany R.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,JOURNAL OF EXPOSURE SCIENCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY,Epidemiology,Geospatial analyses,Health studies,Analytic methods,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2024,Construction of residential histories to estimate long-term environmental exposures in the California Teachers Study cohort
Row_139,"Valley width is largely controlled by lithology and upstream drainage area, but little work has focused on identifying the processes through which valleys widen. Bedrock valleys widen by first laterally eroding bedrock valley walls, followed by the collapse of overlying bedrock material that must then be transported away from the valley wall before the valley can continue widening. We hypothesize that talus piles that cannot be transported by the river protect the valley wall and slow valley widening, while talus piles that are rapidly transported allow for uninterrupted valley widening. We used field measurements from 40 locations in both wide and narrow valleys along the Buffalo River, AR to test this hypothesis. Our data show that wide valleys tend to have fewer talus piles and smaller talus grain sizes, whereas talus in narrow valleys is larger in size and more continuous along valley walls. We calculated potential talus block entrainment at each site location and found that talus blocks in wide valleys are potentially entrained and moved away from valley walls during moderate and large flood events, whereas talus blocks in narrow valleys are very rarely moved. Our results show that the potential transport of talus piles protecting bedrock valley walls from widening is controlled by the block size of collapsed bedrock wall material relative to stream competency. Our results also suggest that persistence versus mobility of collapsed talus piles is an important process in the development of wide bedrock valleys.The width of a river valley largely depends on the rock type of the valley walls and the size of the upstream watershed, but we know very little about how a wide bedrock valley is formed. A river widens a bedrock valley by first undercutting the valley wall, causing the overlying material to collapse into the valley bottom. Then, the river must transport the collapsed material away from the valley wall so that the widening can continue. We use field data to test a conceptual model that links the width of bedrock valleys with how easily rivers can transport collapsed wall material. We measured the size of talus blocks and river channel geometry at 40 locations along the wide and narrow valleys of the Buffalo National River in northwest Arkansas. Next, we calculated whether moderate to very large floods can transport talus blocks away from valley walls. We found that in wide valleys the river can sometimes transport talus, while in narrow valleys, no talus blocks could be transported even in the 1000-year flood. Our results suggest that the widening of bedrock valleys could be stalled by large, immobile blocks of talus that shield valley walls from undercutting and eventual widening.Our data tests a process-based model linking bedrock valley width with how quickly river export collapsed talus away from valley walls In this field site, talus blocks are larger and difficult to transport in narrow valleys, while wide valleys have smaller talus blocks Wide bedrock valleys can develop where rivers efficiently transport talus away from valley walls; rarely transported talus can inhibit valley widening","Groeber, O.

Senior citizens represent an increasingly important group in this transition, as they are increasingly mobile and make up a large share of the population. In this paper, we investigate senior citizen's mobility decision-making, focusing on public transport. Through a survey of 5,000 people in three metropolitan areas in Sweden, we find that while senior citizens desire to live in harmony with nature, they are less likely to see car traffic as a cause of environmental problems. They also struggle with the development of digital service delivery options of public transport. For instance, they use apps less, and like using timetables on paper and signs at bus stops more than younger public transport users. Even so, they are more satisfied with public transport than younger travelers, indicating that many seniors like using public transport, despite lacking the environmental motivations to do so.","Nilsson, Jonas","Jansson, Johan","Nicholas, Kimberly","Zhao, Chunli",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,TRAVEL BEHAVIOUR AND SOCIETY,Senior citizens,Public transport,Digitalization,Satisfaction,Environmental concerns,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2025,"Examining senior citizens' in public transport: The role of digitalization, environmental concern, and traveler satisfaction"

Over the past 20 years, home price inflation and affordable housing shrinkage have been particularly acute in Paris. Such issues have been linked to the displacement of lower-income Parisians and the suburbanisation of poverty on a regional scale. In this article, we match disaggregated data from the Family Benefits Fund (CAF) with information on local housing markets, to empirically document these expulsionary processes. Our methodology is twofold. First, we investigate out-migration factors using logistic regressions. Second, we compare households' changes in access to the city centre and urban resources following a move. Data show that social vulnerability is associated with a greater risk of leaving Paris and that housing welfare is playing a crucial role in mitigating this risk. Also, the higher the pressure on local housing markets, the more social inequalities determine mobility behaviour. Finally, beyond the effects of family structure, patterns of decentralisation are related to income level: less affluent households go farther from the city centre, job opportunities and services than higher-income households.","Guibard, Luc","Le Goix, Renaud",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,URBAN STUDIES,decentralisation,displacement,exclusion,gentrification,housing,out-migration,poverty,,,,,,,,,AUG 2024,Those who leave: Out-migration and decentralisation of welfare beneficiaries in gentrified Paris

Using a real-world scenario from the Leeds Metropolitan Area as a case study, we demonstrate an effective way of combining macro-level mobility simulations based on open data with global optimisation techniques to discover realistic optimal deployment strategies for CAVs. The macro-level mobility simulations are used to assess the quality of a potential multi-route CAV service by quantifying geographic accessibility improvements using an extended version of Dijkstra's algorithm on an abstract multi-modal transport network. The optimisations were carried out using several popular population-based optimisation algorithms that were combined with several routing strategies aimed at constructing the best routes by ordering stops in a realistic sequence.","Han, Kate","Christie, Lee A.","Zavoianu, Alexandru-Ciprian","McCall, John A.

Row_144,"One of the challenges to achieve sustainability in mobility, especially post-pandemic, is to analyse urban accessibility as a service for people, incorporating perceptions of (in)satisfaction with their displacements. This is possible by considering alternatives that inhabitants declare to improve this perception, expanding the analysis beyond aspects only linked to transportation. This research, applied in the territory of the Collao sector, belonging to the Metropolitan Area of Concepci & oacute;n, which, like other neighbourhoods of the city and the world, suffered a strong crisis of immobility as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, dramatically altering the conditions of accessibility of its inhabitants to basic services. The objective was to integrate the perceived accessibility before and during the pandemic with the (in)satisfaction, systematizing declared alternatives to improve it in both situations. The analysis used social geomarketing, obtaining data with declared surveys. Perceptions show walking and proximity as the main elements influencing satisfaction for both periods. Contrary to this, sidewalks in poor condition and vehicular congestion would be factors of dissatisfaction, added to health elements of the pandemic. Results also show that the alternatives declared to increase satisfaction could be implemented in their usual routes, coinciding with previously detected areas of spatial satisfaction. Conclusions remark that integrating scenarios proposed by people into the urban design is relevant in emergency situations.

However, several factors lead to the emergence of fragile and disintegrated systems, where several subsystems work under different schemes of formality. In this context, transit travel tends to be highly multimodal, which at the trip level has been scarcely studied. In this study, the metropolitan geography of the primary forms of Transit Mode Combinations (TMCs) is explored for the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) based on data from the 2017 Household Origin -Destination Survey (HODS17). Transit travel is disaggregated to analyze its multimodality, its link with location, as well as its sociodemographic profiles. The most frequent TMCs are compared regarding average travel distances and speed, and their ridership rates are mapped. A regression model is used to test the socioeconomic and urban form correlates of the TMCs. The results show that transit multimodality has a specific geographical pattern by TMCs. Most Metro users are not those residing close to its stations but those having these stations at their trip destination. Travel by Metro shows a stronger association with decreasing Colectivo ridership than with travel by Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). These findings are discussed based on issues of equity and the emerging debates about the path that transit systems must follow in the developing world.","Bautista-Hernandez, Dorian Antonio","Nieto, Alejandra Trejo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Transit,Commute,Multimodality,Intermodality,Built environment,Mexico City,,,,,,,,,,MAY 2024,"Who uses transit in the journey to work?

Row_148,"The aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic saw more severe outcomes for racial minority groups and economically-deprived communities. Such disparities can be explained by several factors, including unequal access to healthcare, as well as the inability of low income groups to reduce their mobility due to work or social obligations. Moreover, senior citizens were found to be more susceptible to severe symptoms, largely due to age-related health reasons. Adapting vaccine distribution strategies to consider a range of demographics is therefore essential to address these disparities. In this study, we propose a novel approach that utilizes influence maximization (IM) on mobility networks to develop vaccination strategies which incorporate demographic fairness. By considering factors such as race, social status, age, and associated risk factors, we aim to optimize vaccine distribution to achieve various fairness definitions for one or more protected attributes at a time.

In an IoV framework, vehicles communicate with each other, roadside units (RSUs), and the surrounding infrastructure, leveraging edge, fog, and cloud computing for diverse tasks. These networks must support dynamic vehicular mobility and meet strict Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, such as ultra-low latency and high throughput. Terrestrial wireless networks often fail to satisfy these needs, which has led to the integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) into IoV systems. UAV transceivers provide superior line-of-sight (LOS) connections with vehicles, offering better connectivity than ground-based RSUs and serving as mobile RSUs (mRSUs). UAVs improve IoV performance in several ways, but traditional optimization methods are inadequate for dynamic vehicular environments. As a result, recent studies have been incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms into UAV-assisted IoV systems to enhance network performance, particularly in complex areas like resource allocation, routing, and mobility management.

Various geographical models, including ordinary least squares (OLS), geographically weighted regression (GWR), and multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR), were used to examine the spatial association. The MGWR model, with an explanatory power of R2 2 = 0.816, provided a detailed understanding of spatial relationships and variations in DARIA. Our findings indicate specific zones with frequent DARIA occurrences, mainly near major transportation hubs, commercial points, and areas with significant mobility. Key exploratory factors such as illiteracy rate, population density, proximity to playgrounds and slums were highly associated with DARIA incidents. These findings contribute to developing safer, more resilient, and more sustainable cities worldwide.","Roy, Subham","Chowdhury, Indrajit Roy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,APPLIED GEOGRAPHY,Urban crime,Substance use,Hotspot mapping,Moran's I,Urban planning,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,Intoxication in the city: Investigating spatial patterns and determinants of drugs and alcohol-related illegal activities in India's ' s geostrategic corridor

However, it could also increase inequality, with some people struggling to access and use digital services. It is important to understand who is likely to be excluded in this way and why. This can help to identify groups at particular risk of digital exclusion, inform efforts to overcome the barriers, and develop more inclusive digital services. This paper introduces a set of five linked datasets examining a range of user factors affecting the use of digital services. The datasets focus on the use of digital mobility services, but the data is useful in understanding the use of other digital services as well. The user factors considered include technology access, use and competence and attitudes towards digital technology. The datasets were the results of surveys in five European regions and countries (Germany, Italy, Barcelona Metropolitan Area, Flanders and the Netherlands).

Row_157,"Multi-modal public transport (PT) networks within metropolitan areas are often characterized by complexity resulting mainly from their infrastructure, design, operations, and demand. This complexity leads to a significant amount of effort on behalf of the transit agencies to properly evaluate their performance at certain locations and proceed with improvements. This study proposes a methodology based on clustering techniques that facilitates the evaluation of PT networks. The evaluation framework refers to the comparison between the levels of supply and demand at a certain stop. Service supply is quantified through an existing connectivity index, whereas demand is considered through the number of transfers that are performed at each stop. Transfers are critical within multi-modal mobility and often serve as a hindrance for choosing PT. The case study here is the Helsinki PT network in Finland. General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data are used for quantifying connectivity and a dataset deriving from smartphone ticketing application for quantifying transfers. Results include the evaluation for each PT mode and for the overall multi-modal PT network. Focusing on the evaluation of the overall multi-modal PT network, connectivity and transfers levels for 75.60% of stops are found to be well aligned. Therefore, these stops could be eliminated from the list of candidate stops for performing improvements. Of the remaining stops, 19.73% belongs to the case of higher connectivity than transfers and 4.67% to the case of lower connectivity than transfers. Stops included in these two cases require further attention and prioritization during planning processes.","Sipetas, Charalampos","Huang, Zhiren","de Villafranca, Alonso Espinosa Mireles",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD,public transportation,management and performance,performance measures,transformative trends in transit data,GTFS,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,Evaluation Framework for Multi-Modal Public Transport Systems Based on Connectivity and Transfers at Stop Level

In these studies, the social construction of a rural tourist destination or the creation and dissemination of its image is a very important aspect, because it reflects and affects how the countryside is used by society. This research aims to analyse the image of rural areas normally based on a ""rural idyll"" of the lifestyle migrant, at the beginning of the migratory process, and how this image mutates (or not) after spending a year in the chosen destination. Two important conclusions can be drawn from this study. In the first place, even though lifestyle migrations are a minority in the set of migrations that occur in any country in a year, occasion allyin some rural areas they are decisive to overcome their ageing processes since in many cases it is entire families that migrate and not just individuals or older people. Secondly, and at least in the case of Spain, the significant increase in lifestyle migrations to rural areas since the pandemic could be a response to classical urban problems, such as housing, mass tourism or mobility issues symptom of an incipient urban crisis, especially present in many large cities, which are currently losing population, although their metropolitan areas are not.","Renau, Luis del Romero","Salvador, Nuria Fernandez",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,AGER-REVISTA DE ESTUDIOS SOBRE DESPOBLACION Y DESARROLLO RURAL,Urban exodus,"rural Spain, pandemics",migrations,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024,"Looking for Thoreau's Cabin.

Row_159,"Small cities and towns often struggle to provide high-quality public transport services to daily commuters. This is reflected in the modal split, where the share of car users dominates. Such a problem requires a modern solution, where transport planners can verify the impact of potential transport network improvements on the travel behavior of the residents before the changes are actually deployed. This study aims to demonstrate the usefulness of employing an agent-based simulation tool in the decision process for redesigning an express service regional bus route connecting a network of small cities and towns. The model was initially developed as a Mobility as a Service simulation solution for suburban areas of European metropolises. The model is adapted and applied to a case study for the region of Agder, Norway, simulating the impact of nine different scenarios on the patronage of a specific bus route. The simulation model proposes to upgrade the classic agent structure to a persona profile designed specifically for the case study. The main objective of this research is to identify the scenario that maximizes patronage while minimizing total route travel time and additional costs. The results suggest that the proposed model can be successfully adapted from suburban metropolitan areas to the realities of the considered case study, and potentially other similar regions. Specifically, out of the nine proposed scenarios, the model identified four promising ones. One of the four scenarios also fits the cost constraints imposed by the transport provider. The model provides a solid approach for analyzing complex transport systems that are practically impossible to consider in detail if the analysis is done without computer support. Thus, the results can be used as a decision support system for public transport planning and operations in networks of small cities and towns.","Rasca, Sinziana I.","Hu, Bin","Biesinger, Benjamin","Prandtstetter, Matthias",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,PUBLIC TRANSPORT,Public transport,Agent-based simulation,Decision support system,Persona,Small cities and towns,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2024,"Agent-based decision-support model for bus route redesign in networks of small cities and towns: case study of Agder, Norway"

Metals and metalloids in three subcellular fractions (insoluble, thermolabile and thermostable) obtained from the MT purification process were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Lower MT concentrations were observed both during the dry sampling periods, associated to the crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) and during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to reduced urban mobility, decreasing pollutant emissions. The percentage of non-bioavailable metals detected in the insoluble fraction increased throughout the sampling period for both species. Several metals (Cr, Co, Cu, Cd, Mn, Ni, Se, and Zn), most associated with vehicle emissions, the main pollutant source in urban centers, were detected in the thermostable fraction and are, thus, associated with MT through the MT-metal detoxification route. Insoluble metal concentrations were higher in T. stricta , indicating that this species seems less susceptible to cellular metal exposure damage. A potential protective effect of Se and Fe was detected against Pb, suggested by a strong negative correlation, which may be attributed to antioxidant roles and similar uptake routes, respectively.","Beringui, Karmel","Gomes, Maria Vitoria R.","Mello, Felipe Dias","Godoy, Jose Marcus","Saint'Pierre, Tatiana D.","Hauser-Davis, Rachel Ann","Gioda, Adriana",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY,Tillandsia,Metallothionein,Metals and metalloids,Subcellular compartmentalization,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 15 2024,Ecotoxicological assessments of atmospheric biomonitors exposed to urban pollution in a Brazilian metropolis

The surge in road traffic levels poses a primary threat to metropolitan areas, leading to congestion and reduced feasibility of public transportation, ultimately impacting accessibility. Addressing the environmental impact of transportation, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and implementing green cover cultivation and electric transport infrastructure policies are crucial steps in achieving sustainable transportation in urban areas. Therefore, the study aims to evaluate measures to promote sustainable transport infrastructure in Johannesburg. The paper adopted a quantitative research method with the targeted respondents as people responsible for the delivery and construction of the road infrastructure. The questionnaires were also in the form of closed-ended multiple-choice questions. The respondents' responses were analysed using the mean item score (MIS) and factor analysis. The findings revealed that the primary measures to improve the sustainability of existing transportation infrastructure are promoting green infrastructure construction, enhancing transportation facilities to attract more public transportation users, such as safe taxi ranks and embracing traffic management measures. The study concluded by emphasising the increasing recognition of green infrastructure as a holistic strategy to address environmental challenges and improve transportation efficiency within current urban transport systems. It is therefore recommended that cities prioritise the integration of green infrastructure, including eco-friendly transit systems, renewable energy sources and eco-corridors, into urban transport systems to address environmental challenges and improve transportation efficiency.","Ngcobo, Ntebo","Akinradewo, Opeoluwa","Mokoena, Phindile",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING,eco-friendly transit systems,renewable energy in transport,sustainable transport infrastructure,transportation efficiency,urban traffic management,,,,,,,,,,,2024,"Evaluating the Measures to Promote Sustainable Transport Infrastructure: A Case of City of Johannesburg, South Africa"

To support decision-making, we applied a scientific approach to analyse the immediate and long-term impacts of two major planned projects in the most threatened Atlantic Forest region - the Pernambuco Endemism Center, a crucial area for the survival of many endemic species. A Metropolitan Road Arch and a Training School for Career Sergeants are expected in the Environmental Protection Area Aldeia-Beberibe (31,634 ha) in the next few years. The area has 198 protected forest remnants, including one larger than 10,000 ha. Our analysis shows that the projects' implementation may deforest 189 ha, increase fragment number by 3.5 % and decrease the average patch area by 4 %. The largest fragment will be divided into two. We may lose 335,307 trees and 44,655.59 Mg of carbon. Approximately 112.67 ha of watershed protection will be damaged. Thus, in the medium to long term, habitat quality will worsen, and the probability of connectivity will decrease, restricting forest-dependent species' mobility considerably. To date, alternative areas have been proposed in meetings, working groups, and environmental advisory bodies for the analysed projects. We strongly oppose further deforestation and suggest that science-based approaches must be immediately considered for any project that requires forest suppression in highly fragmented landscapes. This is crucial to mitigate the alarming scenarios of extreme climate and biodiversity loss that we are currently witnessing in Brazil and worldwide.","Alves Cunha, Jessica Stefane","Fonseca, Nathan Castro","Vieira de Lima, Cinthia Renata","dos Santos, Jhonathan Gomes","Pereira, Herbert de Tejo","Bezerra, Bruna Martins","Borges Lins-e-Silva, Ana Carolina",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION,Deforestation,Carbon loss,Connectivity,Degradation,Environmental impact,Habitat quality,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2024,Minor loss or huge threat?

This paper proposes a comprehensive approach to assess transport disadvantages and identify areas with limited access to public transport and services. By combining statistical and geographic techniques, we analyze demographic, socioeconomic, and travel data to spatially contextualize areas based on the social structure and understand the characteristics of population groups facing transportation challenges in the Porto Metropolitan Area. Cluster analysis results revealed four distinct clusters with homogeneous characteristics. In contrast, service area analysis assessed the public transport coverage to identify served zones, the population within these zones, and activities reached in the region. Our findings indicate that suburban and rural areas often lack access to public transport stops, aggravated by lower service frequencies, leading to high reliance on private cars for essential activities, such as work and education. Despite the good geographical coverage of rail and bus stops, urban and central-urban areas also suffer from inadequate service frequencies, impacting public transport usage. Improving service quality in high-demand areas could encourage greater public transport utilization and enhance accessibility.

The system is composed of a dedicated simulator that evaluates the transport scenario and an intermodal dispatcher that optimises the service according to requests, accounting for their time windows. This intermodal approach considers trips with multiple legs, for which either ride-pooling or public transport are used. This study investigates how the batch size and the early dispatching of the last leg, supported by a vehicle reservation strategy, impact diverse demand profiles that range from single-passenger to multiple-passenger requests, while also addressing the critical aspect of fleet size.

Nevertheless, gender biases in physical infrastructure investments lead to negative consequences for women and children that reduce their empowerment and limit their economic benefits. Public fixed-route buses, such as those in Washington, DC, illustrate how physical transportation infrastructure has innate gender biases. These young residents likely depend on strollers to travel longer than a few blocks. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) runs the public transportation system in Washington, DC. In 2021, 7% of DC's 720,000 residents were under five. WMATA maintains a fleet of approximately 1595 buses, 95% of which banned the onboarding of open strollers until recently. This ban directly limited the use of Metro buses for the caregivers of young children, primarily women. It also reduced the opportunities for these caregivers to participate in DC's economic life. In neighborhoods dependent on buses for essential mobility, the stroller ban reduces employment, healthcare, social service, educational, and recreational offerings beyond walkable distances.

Even with all the recognized benefits and recent advancements in energy efficiency, decrease of noise, and environmental impact reduction, the market of electric and hydrogen mobility is still not up to par. Allocating charging stations in metropolitan areas for electric vehicles is considered as one of the most significant obstacles preventing electric and hydrogen vehicles from becoming more widely used. In this paper, an efficient approach aimed at finding optimal locations for electric vehicles (EV) charging stations in urban areas is proposed. Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm technique is utilized with the proposed approach. Various parameters were taken into consideration in this work, such as the horizontal distance that EVs travel to reach charging stations (CSs), and positive slope that EVs face to reach charging stations. The optimization problem is formulated as a Mixed-integer problem. The objective function works on minimizing the energy consumption of EVs to reach CSs in the investigated area. Difference constraints are incorporated with the proposed approach in order to increase the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach. The proposed approach is applied on real world datasets and is experimentally validated using through comparison with Genetic Algorithm and the greedy approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach saves energy about 22% and 43% compared to the genetic algorithm and greedy technique, respectively.","Aljaidi, Mohammad","Samara, Ghassan","Singla, Manish Kumar","Alsarhan, Ayoub","Hassan, Mohammad","Safaraliev, Murodbek","Matrenin, Pavel","Tavlintsev, Alexander",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY,Hydrogen storage,Electric vehicles,Charging station,Energy consumption,Hydrogen,Placement,Elevation,GA,PSO,,,,,,,OCT 18 2024,A particle swarm optimizer-based optimization approach for locating electric vehicles charging stations in smart cities

However, comprehensive studies on emission patterns and decarbonization strategies in these metropolitan areas remain limited. This study presents a novel and portable big data-based workflow for megacities to reveal their spatiotemporal dynamics of road CO2 emissions and quantify decarbonization potentials associated with inter-city travel and the 15-minute city concept. We take Guangzhou City (China) as a case study. Our results reveal that primary purpose trips produce 17 % more CO2 emissions than secondary trips on average. Inter-city trips account for 36.3 % of the total emissions in the city, and those for primary purposes exhibit closer spatial distributions with intra-city trips. While providing more 15-minute-walk POIs exhibits a marginally diminishing effect on reducing trip average emissions, comprehensive implementation of the 15-minute city concept in Guangzhou can reduce up to 56.3 % of the total emissions from non-home-related passenger trips, with variations observed across different trip purposes (40 %-70 %).

Results indicate that factors such as expressway proportion, travel cost, and road density at the origin and destination locations have similar effects on route variability during morning and evening commuting. However, departure time, travel distance, and the number of traffic lights significantly differ in impacting route variability between the two scenarios. This study provides a foundation for optimizing route choices and alleviating traffic emissions during peak hours through advanced TDM measures.

This study examined how different street classification scenarios will affect active transportation equity. Four different scenarios with different planning rationales were developed that reformulate the street classification in a municipality within a metropolitan area, i.e., Kallithea in Athens, Greece. These scenarios give rise to new street categories that reallocate street space favoring active transport users. The evaluation of active transportation equity was carried out by utilizing spatial analysis and welfare economics through the lens of egalitarian and sufficientarian approaches. Based on the results, scenarios that propose new urban centers as well as a readable street classification with traffic calming zones determined by ring roads seem to be more efficient in accommodating vulnerable users in an equitable way. Hence, new planning schemes should rely on active modes, leaving automobiles behind. In general, measuring the impact of street classification scenarios through the lens of equity is critical for improving the quality of life in cities.

Previous research has mainly been conducted in Asia and North America and in metropolitan areas. Potential interdependencies have been analysed mostly towards public transport (PT). Surprisingly, investigations concerning the usage of shared e-scooters and other shared mobility services have been scarce. However, understanding possible (inter-)dependencies and potentials for inter- and multimodality is crucial for policymakers and transport planners to design efficient and sustainable transportation systems. This is why we draw on an original data set of 118,047 shared e-scooter trips in Karlsruhe, a non-metropolitan city in southwest Germany and add information about carsharing and PT. Apart from station information for both modes, we add departure information for tramways, and weather data. Shared e-scooter data is retrieved via the local providers from November 2020 to April 2021, information about the stations of carsharing and PT is added via OpenStreetMap, and tramway service data is retrieved via the local authority. We find an average trip distance of 1.40 km and substantially less usage on Sundays. The potential of combining shared e-scooters is higher for PT than for carsharing. Shared e-scooter trips show longer distances in times of lower or none PT service. Negative binomial regression models with fixed effects for the PT or carsharing stations show that the number of tram departures positively affects shared e-scooter usage, particularly at off-peak times. Applying mode shift scenarios and focusing on the usage phase, the energy consumption effect of shared e-scooters is found to be between -5 to +0.5 TWh.

Row_177,"The relationship between the built environment and transportation mode choice is well-studied, but less attention has been spent on the way that urban environments influence the relative travel costs for different modes. This paper uses a 'cost-distance' framework to assess the tradeoffs between transportation modes for commuters in the Dublin metropolitan area and employs random forest models to investigate non-linearities in the relationships between relative mobility by mode and built environment characteristics. The results suggest that more 'walkable' built environments increase the efficiency of active transport modes; however, we also find that these environments are negatively related to cost efficiency for public transport, likely due to congestion effects for buses. Beyond these theoretical insights, the results also provide a spatially targeted set of priorities for policymakers looking to improve the efficiency of sustainable transportation modes. These methods could be applied to any global region with access to the requisite data.","Credit, Kevin","O'Driscoll, Conor",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Public transport,Cycling,Walkability,Urban form,Travel time,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 2024,Assessing modal tradeoffs and associated built environment characteristics using a cost-distance framework

Row_179,"Counterurban migration is known to be driven by lifestyle motivations, in which employment considerations are more of an enabling factor than a driver. In this paper, the self-reported motives, along with labour-market and lifestyle outcomes, of counterurban migration are investigated. The focus is on trade-offs between work-related and lifestyle-related amenities for different subgroups based on recent survey data in Sweden collected from families with children in 2018-2019 who left metropolitan regions. The key results indicate that, overall, counterurban movers are satisfied with their decision and the majority cite the importance of lifestyle amenities over work-related amenities. Our conclusion is that, besides voluntary trade-offs, counterurban migration does not necessarily pose a trade-off between labour-market and lifestyle-related amenities since, to a large extent, individuals reported better outcomes in both areas. This study makes two contributions. Firstly, the data considers self-reported outcomes, including labour-market outcomes beyond income and lifestyle outcomes. Secondly, we explore individual characteristics of counterurban migrants in relation to post-migration outcomes in different destinations.","Neyse, Sarper","Lundholm, Emma",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,REGIONAL STUDIES REGIONAL SCIENCE,Counterurbanisation,internal migration,lifestyle,subjective well-being (SWB),urban hierarchy,D10,I31,O15,R23,,,,,,,DEC 31 2024,Individual gains and trade-offs from counterurban migration in Sweden

Emotional responses are not only integral to personal quality of life but also influence urban practices. Concepts aimed at fostering sustainable, inclusive, and vibrant urban areas, hinge upon fostering positive emotional experiences. Understanding how people perceive urban spaces is central to promoting active mobility and social interaction. This study focuses on two districts in Potenza, Italy, examining the distribution of emotional responses and identifying built environment factors that influence individuals' reactions. The study operates on the premise that built environment factors elicit distinct emotions, which, in turn, impact individuals' practices and motivations.

Row_181,"When interacting with driverless cars, pedestrians might be emboldened to jaywalk knowing the vehicles will slow down for them automatically. Increased jaywalking might disrupt traffic flow and pose challenges for traffic law enforcement. Few studies examined pedestrians' attitudes toward driverless cars' safety implication, management strategies for the interactions between pedestrians and driverless cars, and how pedestrians would expect their street crossing behavior to change in the presence of driverless cars. We conducted an online stated preference survey of 1,000 residents in the Philadelphia and the Seattle metropolitan areas to investigate respondents' attitudes toward driverless cars and their preferences of jaywalking under different driverless car saturation levels. Through descriptive data analysis and multilevel binomial logit analysis, we found that overall pedestrians felt less safe with driverless cars on the road. Pedestrians preferred limiting the speeds of driverless cars or disabling driverless functions in areas with heavy pedestrian traffic to increasing enforcement for jaywalking laws. Multilevel binomial logit analysis showed pedestrians were more likely to jaywalk in the presence of driverless cars in high visibility and low traffic volume, and were deterred by bigger, faster streets. Respondents' current crossing behavior might serve as an indicator of their crossing behavior in the presence of driverless cars. Our findings remind cities that sound street design strategies could help to ensure safer interactions between pedestrians and driverless cars and greater acceptance of driverless cars on urban streets.","Dong, Xiaoxia","Guerra, Erick","Daziano, Ricardo A.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART F-TRAFFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR,Crossing behavior,Driverless car,Jaywalking,Pedestrian safety,Stated preference survey,Street design,,,,,,,,,,MAY 2024,Will automated vehicles encourage more jaywalking?

Row_182,"IMPORTANCE With older drivers representing the fastest growing segment of the driver population and dementia prevalence increasing with age, policymakers face the challenge of balancing road safety and mobility of older adults. In states that require reporting a dementia diagnosis to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), individuals with dementia may be reluctant to disclose symptoms of cognitive decline, and clinicians may be reluctant to probe for those symptoms, which may be associated with missed or delayed diagnoses. OBJECTIVE To assess whether DMV reporting policies for drivers with dementia are associated with primary care clinicians' underdiagnosing dementia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study used data from the 100% Medicare fee-for-service program and the Medicare Advantage plans from 2017 to 2019 on 223 036 primary care clinicians with at least 25 Medicare patients. Statistical analysis was performed from July to October 2023. EXPOSURES State DMV reporting policies for drivers with dementia. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcome was a binary variable indicating whether the clinician underdiagnosed dementia or not. Each clinician's expected number of dementia cases was estimated using a predictive model based on patient characteristics. Comparing the estimation with observed dementia diagnoses identified clinicians who underdiagnosed dementia vs those who did not, after accounting for sampling errors. RESULTS Four states have clinician reporting mandates, 14 have mandates requiring drivers to self-report dementia diagnoses, and 32 states and the District of Columbia do not have explicit requirements. Among primary care clinicians in states with clinician reporting mandates (n = 35 620), 51.4% were female, 91.9% worked in a metropolitan area, and 19.9% of the patient panel were beneficiaries dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. Among primary care clinicians in states with patient self-reporting mandates (n = 57 548), 55.7% were female, 83.1% worked in a metropolitan area, and 15.4% of the patient panel were dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. Among clinicians in states without mandates, 55.7% were female, 83.0% worked in a metropolitan area, and 14.6% of the patient panel were dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. Clinicians in states with clinician reporting mandates had an adjusted 12.4% (95% CI, 10.5%-14.2%) probability of underdiagnosing dementia compared with 7.8% (95% CI, 6.9%-8.7%) in states with self-reporting and 7.7% (95% CI, 6.9%-8.4%) in states with no mandates, an approximately 4-percentage point difference (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Results of this cross-sectional study of primary care clinicians suggest that mandatory DMV policies for clinicians to report patients with dementia may be associated with a higher risk of missed or delayed dementia diagnoses. Future research is needed to better understand the unintended consequences and the risk-benefit tradeoffs of these policies.","Jun, Hankyung","Liu, Ying","Chen, Emily","Becker, Andrew","Mattke, Soeren",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JAMA NETWORK OPEN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,APR 25 2024,State Department of Motor Vehicles Reporting Mandates of Dementia Diagnoses and Dementia Underdiagnosis

However, the social implications of their travel behaviour changes remain less explored. Applying latent transition analysis on longitudinal data collected in 2019 and 2022, we examined travel behaviour changes among young adults in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area, Canada in response to two life events- start of employment after completion of education and residential relocation and explored their social sustainability-related implications in terms of potential transportation-related social exclusion. Young adults showed a higher probability of becoming car users in 2022, however, those who joined workforce and relocated to urban areas were more likely to become transit users and active modes users.

Row_184,"Based on the analysis of one-week GPS-based travel diary data from the four largest metropolitan areas in California, this study performs a latent-class cluster analysis and identifies four distinctive traveler groups with varying levels of multimodality. These groups are characterized by their distinctive use of five travel modes (i.e., single-occupant vehicles, carpooling, public transit, biking, and walking) for both work and non-work trips. Two of these groups are more car-oriented and less multimodal (i.e., drive-alone users and carpoolers), whereas the other two are less car-oriented and display higher levels of multimodality (i.e., transit users and cyclists). Results from this study reveal the unique profiles of each traveler group in terms of their sociodemographic characteristics and built-environment attributes. The study further investigates the different characteristics of each traveler group in relation to ridehailing adoption, trip frequency and trip attributes. Transit users are found to have the highest rate of ridehailing adoption and usage. They are also more prone to use pooled ridehailing services in comparison to other groups. In terms of mode substitution, if ridehailing were not available, respondents tend to choose the mode they use most frequently. In other words, car-based travelers are more likely to substitute ridehailing trips with car trips, whereas non-car-based travelers are more likely to replace ridehailing with less-polluting modes. The findings from this study will prove valuable for transit agencies and policymakers interested in integrating ridehailing with other modes and promoting more multimodal and less car-dependent lifestyles.","Iogansen, Xiatian","Lee, Yongsung","Young, Mischa","Compostella, Junia","Circella, Giovanni","Jenn, Alan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,TRAVEL BEHAVIOUR AND SOCIETY,Travel modality,Ridehailing,Latent-class cluster analysis,Mode substitution,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2025,"Ridehailing use, travel patterns and multimodality: A latent-class cluster analysis of one-week GPS-based travel diaries in California"
Row_185,"In this paper, we present a mixed qualitative-quantitative approach to analyse the multiple dimensions of the barrier effect caused by the removal of all at-level pedestrian crossings on a railway in a residential area of Santiago, Chile, as part of a new suburban rail service. A set of interviews with a wide range of stakeholders is followed by a quantitative analysis of time delays and extra discomfort for pedestrians, as we measure both the horizontal and vertical detours on walking distance and time, due to having to cross on pedestrian overpasses and underpasses. We find that (i) the new suburban rail service is a source of social inclusion on a metropolitan scale (accessibility gains) and of social exclusion on a more local scale, due to a barrier effect (ii) the confinement of the railway produces strong negative impacts on pedestrians that need to cross the railway, by increasing walking times and by worsening their perception of security and comfort (iii) underpasses and overpasses increase between twofold and fourfold the time needed to cross the railway on average, relative to the case of atlevel crossings, (iv) taking into account the increased physical burden and insecurity perceived on overpasses and underpasses, weighted walking times increase up to ten times relative to at-level crossing, and (v) women, elderly people and pedestrians with heavy luggage are more affected by the increased walking time. Traditional methods employed to analyse large-scale transport projects should assess the negative implications of the barrier effect on local communities, as well as the relief measures designed to reduce local segregation, especially in vulnerable communities. The results of this study are useful to quantify the social value of such relief measures, particularly in highly unequal urban settings.","Tirachini, Alejandro","Inostroza, Francisca","Mora, Rodrigo","Cuevas, Daniela","Fuchser, Diego",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,CASE STUDIES ON TRANSPORT POLICY,Barrier effect,Pedestrian mobility,Community severance,Transport infrastructure,Transport externalities,Pedestrian comfort,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2024,Externalities from the confinement of a railway: Analysis of the barrier effect

In this paper, we study the reasons behind the support among the Mexican population for increasing or introducing new taxes, under two different progressivity schemes. Through a face-to-face survey representative of Mexican metropolitan areas, we find that there is substantial support for increasing taxes for high-income groups and corporations. The introduction of new taxes for these groups has a mean support of 47.6% (in comparison with 19.5% for those without a threshold). Increasing taxes for these groups, on the other hand, has a mean support of 31.9% (in comparison with 7% for the taxes paid by the general population). This desire is mediated by the perception that high-income groups do not fulfill their tax obligations. We also find that factors traditionally related to equity and equality of opportunities are less relevant, which suggests that this support could be driven by the desire to equalize outcomes.","Campos-Vazquez, Raymundo M.","Cepeda-Francese, Camilo A.","Krozer, Alice","Ramirez-Alvarez, Aurora A.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,TRIMESTRE ECONOMICO,Taxes,inequality,rich people,Mexico,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT-DEC 2024,Determinants of social support to increase and introduce new taxes for high-income groups in Mexico
Row_189,"The relentless expansion of urban populations and the surge in e-commerce have increased the demand for rapid delivery services, leading to an increase in truck traffic that contributes to urban congestion, environmental pollution, and economic inefficiencies. The critical challenge this poses is not only in managing urban spaces efficiently but also in aligning with global sustainability goals. This study addresses the pressing need for innovative solutions to reduce reliance on truck transportation in congested urban areas without compromising the efficiency of freight delivery systems. This study contributes a novel approach that leverages electrified and autonomous aircraft (EAA) cargo shuttles to shift the bulk of air transportable freight from road to air, specifically targeting underutilized airports and establishing vertiports in remote locations. By applying data mining techniques to analyze freight flow data, this research identifies key commodity categories and metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) where the implementation of EAA services could significantly mitigate truck-induced congestion. The findings reveal that targeting a select few commodities and MSAs can potentially decrease truck traffic, with electronics emerging as the dominant commodity category, and cities like Los Angeles and Chicago as prime candidates for initial EAA service deployment. Stakeholders in urban planning, transportation logistics, and environmental policy will find this study's insights beneficial.

The purpose of this research is to examine consumer attitudes on EVs and the factors that prevent their mainstream adoption. Unlike conventional survey methods, the researchers used theme analysis to uncover and make sense of the myriad of aspects that went into their purchase. The study also takes into account the often-overlooked part played by emotions. People's openness to express their opinions online makes eWOM a useful source of information for this study on electric automobiles. This technique is useful for identifying any and all gaps (physical and intangible) between a company's offering (EVs) and a customer's expectations. This research also sheds light on the interconnected nature of these obstructions, revealing a potentially crippling snowball effect on adoption rates. In this study, we look at how technology has altered transportation in the United States. Efficiency, sustainability, safety, and accessibility are only few of the topics covered, along with infrastructure, vehicle technology, and mobility services. This study analyzes data and research to provide light on how technology has changed the face of transportation in the United States. This research looked at how electric car market share relates to the availability of government subsidies and other important socioeconomic factors. The findings showed a negative correlation between energy prices and EV adoption, whereas a positive correlation between the market share of electric vehicles in each state and the presence of urban highways and government incentives. Based on the results of the sensitivity analysis, it appears that the cost of power has the greatest impact on the number of people opting to buy electric cars. The analysis of EV adoption found that the price of power and the availability of charging stations in metropolitan areas had the greatest impact.","Kasem, John",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,QUALITY-ACCESS TO SUCCESS,Electric vehicles,Technology adoption,Electric vehicle,Transportation,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2024,The Impact of Technology on Transportation in the United States

Incorporating these services in urban environments involves various principles, partnerships, organizational strategies, and methodologies. A vast body of research exists on ecosystem services. However, there is a lack of studies that address equity concerns in access to urban ecosystem services. This paper critically reviews the literature to investigate the state of access to ecosystem services in urban areas. We use deductive content analysis for this purpose. We explore traditional concepts of justice and update them by examining the sources and types of ecosystem services in urban environments. We examine justice typology considering various social, environmental, infrastructural, ecological, and mobility issues. We also explore different justice dimensions, including distributional, procedural, recognitional, and restorative issues. Results showed a notable prioritization of green infrastructures (73%) over blue infrastructures (5%). Furthermore, there has been an apparent emphasis on cultural services (42%) and regulating services (25%) in offering recreational activities, fostering social integration, improving place -making capabilities, showcasing adaptability, and demonstrating resilience. An important finding is that most of the publications (87%) highlight that there is no justice in access to ecosystem services. Regarding typologies, we found that there has been more attention to environmental justice, and infrastructural, ecological, and mobility justice are underexplored. As for dimensions, more attention has been paid to distributional and recognitional justice at the cost of restorative justice. A key shortcoming is that cities in the Global South are not adequately represented in the literature, despite their significance for achieving sustainable urban development in the coming decades.","Haque, Md.

Cognitive decline and reduced arm reflexes following balance loss impede the elderly's execution of activities of daily living. To address these challenges, robots have emerged as valuable assistants for elderly individuals in their daily activities, including object manipulation, and have the potential to significantly improve the quality of life for the aging population. However, no research has been undertaken to enhance the selection of object handover locations in humanrobot interactions by merging topology mapping with both parties' range of motion, based on personal space. Based on the idea of personal space within humanrobot proxemics, this research presents an alternative approach that makes use of topological mapping while taking into account the range of motion of both humans and robots. This research aims to minimize the expenses related to human -robot proximity and to determine the best locations for item handovers in order to discover which locations are optimal. In order to improve object handover locations, this work is a groundbreaking attempt to combine growing neural gas and human proxemics inside a robotic framework. Furthermore, it implies the creation of robot behaviors that resemble human proximity by estimating personal distances and incorporating rule -based requirements for item handover locations by taking into account the mobility ranges of both humans and robots.

This species, native to the Mediterranean Basin and Western Asia, is commonly used as an ornamental plant in many parts of the world, including Australia, Europe, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States. It is not recognized in major world invasive databases as being a problematic invasive species. We documented the recovery of this naturalised population and evaluated other records of naturalised occurrences in the Cape Town metropolitan area. We assessed the known characteristics of the species in terms of its fire tolerance, water relations, shade preference, seed set, dispersal and germination. We propose that fire constitutes a useful tool to expose this species for eradication through herbicide application.

However, further research is required to fully understand the relationship between this ratio, its components, and meteorological conditions in various scenarios. This study analyzed the effect of COVID-19 restrictions on the PM2.5/PM10 ratio in Recife, Brazil. The data showed that the PM2.5/PM10 ratio significantly decreased in 2020 due to the reduction in urban mobility and human activities. The strictest restrictions were maintained in the state until August and as soon as the first major loosening took place, the ratio began to approach typical pollution levels. The average daily PM2.5/PM10 ratios for 2020, 2021 and 2022 were 0.52 +/- 0.08, 0.58 +/- 0.03 and 0.58 +/- 0.02, respectively, lower than those found in other metropolitan areas. During the phases of greater restrictions, the PM2.5/PM10 ratio had an average value of 0.48 +/- 0.08 and as restrictions were lifted, it became 0.56 +/- 0.03. The results showed that the reductions observed in 2020 were directly related to the decrease in anthropogenic emissions of PM2.5. A machine learning approach was used to estimate the expected PM2.5/PM10 ratio, corrected for the meteorological conditions and it was found that the observed ratios were lower than expected even in this scenario. Furthermore, only temperature and wind speed presented significant correlation to the PM2.5/PM10 ratio in both the scenarios with and without restriction of activities. Our study provides valuable insights into the efficacy of restriction measures in the Brazilian tropical and coastal metropolis of Recife and also highlight the intrinsic relation between the ratio and the local meteorological variables.","Tavella, Ronan Adler","Brum, Rodrigo de Lima","da Silva, Leopoldo dos Santos","Freitas, Livia da Silva","Ramires, Paula Florencio","They, Ng Haig","Coronas, Mariana Vieira","da Silva Junior, Flavio Manoel Rodrigues",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,AEROSOL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,Air pollution,Meteorological parameters,Machine learning,Brazil,Air quality,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2024,Footprints of COVID-19 on PM2.5/PM10 Ratio in a Brazilian Tropical Metropolis
Row_197,"This study investigates disparities in Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption among different socio-economic groups and geographic areas within Texas. We focused on the Texas Triangle, which includes Austin, Houston, San Antonio, and the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area. Using EV registration data, our study applied unsupervised machine learning techniques, specifically hierarchical clustering analysis, to identify distinct patterns of EV adoption. We conducted a longitudinal analysis to investigate changes in carmakers' market share and to understand EV adoption patterns over time. We used Anselin Local Moran's I analysis to profile the characteristics of Tesla owners. Our analysis results revealed significant market segmentation in the EV market, particularly between different sale price ranges and brands. Notably, Tesla emerged as a market leader with strong brand appeal in the mid to high price tiers. EV adoption has been spreading from the Texas Triangle. Clusters with overall high EV registration, as identified in Anselin Local Moran's I analysis, were more associated with high-income, highly educated communities, where residents own multiple vehicles and are predominantly White. This trend was also observed among Tesla owners in relative to low-tier EV adopters.

Row_198,"Ethnoracial segregation persists as a pressing issue in American cities. Understanding these issues is crucial for promoting social equity and justice, and planning more inclusive cities. Prior research has predominantly emphasized residential ethnoracial diversity but has often overlooked or inadequately addressed ethnoracial diversity and segregation in individuals' daily activities and places they visit, due in part to data limitations. This study leverages a dynamic measure of ethnoracial diversity and dominance at the finest spatial scale, specifically at the Points of Interest (POI) level and various temporal contexts. Using one month of privacy-enhanced mobile phone location data in Los Angeles County, California, this study explores ethnoracial diversity and spatial segregation simultaneously in POI visits in LA County. Our findings confirm that individuals' daily mobility in urban areas enhances ethnoracial mixing at activity locations. Empirical results indicate that the diversity of visitors to a POI is significantly higher than the neighborhood diversity where the same POI is located. A significant positive linear relationship was found between the neighborhood diversity of POIs and the diversity of visitors. About 34 % of the variance in the diversity of visitors to POIs can be explained by the neighborhood diversity of POIs. Our results also suggest significant spatial clusters of isolated/integrated areas regarding ethnoracial mixing in people's daily activity locations. Notably, the Hispanic or Latino population tends to stay in their own communities and experiences a higher level of segregation in their daily activity locations. The findings have significant implications for urban planners and policymakers to design targeted solutions and policies to promote social equity, integration, and equal access to public amenities and opportunities in urban spaces.","Su, Rongxiang","Newsham, Niall","Dodge, Somayeh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS,Ethnoracial diversity,Segregation,Point of interest,Mobile phone data,Human activities,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,Spatiotemporal dynamics of ethnoracial diversity and segregation in Los Angeles County: Insights from mobile phone data
Row_199,"The Rapid Rail Transit (Metro) systems have been set as an important tool for world cities to supply the transit riders (users) the mobility and accessibility requirements in the high demand (highly loaded) urban corridors, which require a combination of large passenger capacity and service quality. Given their large capacity and the associated high service level and environmental performance, the metro systems provide a high quality accessibility, which ultimately, set them as a structural tool to drive the long term urban spatial and economic development.Metro systems are set as urban megaprojects, given their required very large outlays of capital intensive investments on long-lived assets, such as guideways, stations, rolling stock, and the associated systems (electrification and signaling). The system's design features might strongly affect its capacity, operational flexibility, service performance, and cost, with the passenger-carrying capacity in the highest-demand sections of the network being one of the most critical design parameters, given its effect on the system's investments.This work presents, based on the state of the art available public technical data, a review of the rail metro technology challenges associated with their implementation and expansion initiatives.

This information, mainly available from geotechnical surveys, can be integrated into spatial databases to produce operational models. Aiming to generate strategies that enable the visualisation of underground properties in highly anthropised environments, the following four-phase methodology has been proposed: (a) Gathering of geotechnical data; (b) Spatial and statistical analysis; (c) Database design; (d) Generation of 2D and 3D models. Following the aforementioned criteria and using open sources, a spatial dataset of 650 points located within the historical centre of Seville (Spain) has been developed. This urban area is characterised by the heterogeneous distribution of its soil layers and their geotechnical properties. The results show that the application of this method enables a prompt and efficient display of the distribution of geotechnical layers in urban and metropolitan environments, by considering the variations in their mechanical properties. This simplified approach therefore establishes a new starting point for the development of predictive strategies based on approaches of a more complex nature that facilitate the analysis of the interactions between subsoil, buildings, and infrastructures.","Soriano-Cuesta, Cristina","Romero-Hernandez, Rocio","Mascort-Albea, Emilio J.","Kada, Martin","Fuls, Andreas","Jaramillo-Morilla, Antonio",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,REMOTE SENSING,microzoning,urban geotechnical maps,Geographic Information Systems (GIS),LIDAR,Digital Soil Modelling,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2024,Evaluation of Open Geotechnical Knowledge in Urban Environments for 3D Modelling of the City of Seville (Spain)

Unlike other countries where food security is mainly achieved through informal trade, in Chile, weekly streets markets is the structural system providing fresh food. Supermarkets complement spatially and functionally street markets. Both systems and their temporal operation makes that the Chilean food deserts main characteristic is their intermittency. The purpose of this research is to analyze the Chilean food deserts to contrast them with the predominant North and Global South discourses and position the Chilean case internationally. Specifically, this article looks to analyze the importance of the spatiotemporal dimension in food access studies where a healthy diet depends on systems other than supermarkets characterized by intermittent operation over week. For this purpose, this article takes the Metropolitan Area of Concepcion as case. First, the research identifies the location and the socioeconomic groups associated with the different degrees of access from a static perspective based on the spatial distribution of supermarkets and street markets. Then, the dynamic analysis introduces the time dimension to reveal the variability of access patterns and the impact on vulnerable groups. The intermittency of the food deserts positions Chile as halfway between the Global South and North models. The particularity of this model is that intermittently and regularly provides a healthy food environment within food deserts. Additionaly, it has the potential to be planned for overcoming structural inequalities in spatial fresh food access.","Zazo-Moratalla, Ana","Orellana-McBride, Alejandro",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,HABITAT INTERNATIONAL,Food access,Healthy diet,Supermarkets,Street markets,Informality,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2024,Intermittent food deserts.

Row_202,"Botulinum toxin-A (BoNT-A) injection is known to exert beneficial effects on muscle tone, joint mobility and gait in children with cerebral palsy (CP). However, recent animal and human studies have raised the concern that BoNT-A might be harmful to muscle integrity. In CP-children, the impact of BoNT-A on muscle structure has been poorly studied, and inconsistent results have been reported. This study was aimed at determining the time course effect of a single BoNT-A administration on medial gastrocnemius (MG) morphology in CP-children. MG microbiopsies from 12 ambulant and BoNT-A-naive CP-children (age, 3.4 (2.3) years, ranging from 2.5 to 7.8 years; seven boys and five girls; GMFCS I = 5, II = 4 and III = 3) were collected before and 3 and 6 months after BoNT-A treatment to analyze the fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA) and proportion; capillarization; and satellite cell (SC) content. Compared with the baseline, the fCSA decreased at 3 months (-14%, NS) and increased at 6 months (+13%, NS). Fiber size variability was significantly higher at 3 months (type I: +56%, p = 0.032; type IIa: +37%, p = 0.032) and 6 months (type I: +69%, p = 0.04; type IIa: +121%, p = 0.032) compared with the baseline. The higher type I proportion seen at 3 months was still present and more pronounced at 6 months (type I: +17%, p = 0.04; type IIx: -65%, p = 0.032). The capillary fiber density was reduced at 3 months (type I: -43%, NS; type II: -44%, p = 0.0320) but normalized at 6 months. There was a non-significant increase in SC/100 fibers at 3 months (+75%, NS) and 6 months (+40%, NS) compared with the baseline.

However, with the deployment of 5G networks, even 5G NSA by 4G LTE, the complexity of the operating environment of mobile networks has increased. To evaluate the behavior of mobile networks in terms of signal quality and other important metrics for mobile telephony, we developed a dataset consisting of 33 radio parameters that can collect up to 736,974 records generated daily by smartphones and tablets. The dataset comprises samples collected in cities situated on the banks of the Amazon and Negro rivers.

At the same time, there has been a shift in urban dynamics, characterised by the diversification of peripheries and the emergence of sub-centralities, challenging conventional notions of urban marginalisation. It underscores the need for a deeper understanding of urban insertion as the attention moves from macro -scale segregation to micro -scale analysis. Amidst this context, urban insertion remains a subject of dispute and ambiguity within the literature, often conflated with peripheralisation and segregation. Addressing this gap, we advance toward a concept of urban insertion, proposing an analytical framework that integrates multiple criteria from diverse disciplinary perspectives. This framework was empirically validated in the metropolitan area of Curitiba (Brazil) by analysing 55 social housing developments constructed over the past decade. The findings yield valuable insights and pragmatic guidelines for evaluating urban insertion and informing policy decisions in similar contexts.","Neto, Paulo Nascimento","de Paula, Marina Quirino Luxi","de Araujo, Agnes Silva","de Oliveira, Everton Narciso",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,TEMA-JOURNAL OF LAND USE MOBILITY AND ENVIRONMENT,Urban insertion,Peripheralization,Social housing,Housing program,Segregation,,,,,,,,,,,2024,From peripheries to neighbourhoods: measuring urban insertion of social housing projects

These changes affect the urban environment and impact several aspects, such as climate, energy, air quality, and socioeconomic factors, among others. Therefore, it is important to lead cities towards sustainable development. The goal of this paper is to understand which domains should be considered to assess the sustainability of cities, at an environmental level and with a focus on air quality, and how those domains are connected, based on a comprehensive literature review, which resulted in 1479 articles. The results show that ""Urban Climate"", ""Air Quality"", ""Urban Morphology"", ""Health"", ""Energy"" and ""Mobility"" are the most common domains in research, and that 39% of articles only assess one domain. It is possible to understand that though 96% of articles contain up to three domains, the great majority do not assess those domains in an integrated way. There are many studies that evaluate important domains of urban areas; however, they mostly evaluate these effects in isolation, and rarely in tandem. Moving forward, it is important to understand how to best connect the most relevant domains, under an integrated multicriteria approach, thus allowing a more complete assessment of the sustainability of urban areas.","Augusto, Bruno","Rafael, Sandra","Coelho, Margarida C.","Ferreira, Joana",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,SUSTAINABILITY,sustainability,urban morphology,systematic literature review,air quality,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2024,Connecting the Dots between Urban Morphology and the Air Quality of Cities under a Changing Climate: A Bibliometric Analysis

Advocates, practitioners, and scholars have offered a range of explanations for pre-pandemic patronage decline. This analysis examines the demand-side of this phenomenon by focusing on high-propensity transit riders, and, in particular, immigrants in the most populous US state: California. Drawing on the California add-on to the 2009 and 2017 National Household Travel Surveys, we evaluate changes in transit use among Hispanic and Asian immigrants. We find that during the study period, transit trip frequency of Hispanic immigrants declined, converging toward the ridership patterns of US-born Hispanics. While this trend was largely the result of rising incomes, increased vehicle ownership, and lower residential densities among non-US-born Hispanics, all else equal, Hispanic immigrants continued to use transit more than their US-born counterparts. By contrast, transit trip making by Asian immigrants diverged from that of US-born Asians. Notably, this divergence was not the result of declining perperson trip making by Asian immigrants, which was relatively stable during the study period. Instead, the growing gap was due to increases in transit trip frequency by US-born Asians.","Schouten, Andrew","Blumenberg, Evelyn","Taylor, Brian D.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,TRAVEL BEHAVIOUR AND SOCIETY,Transit use,Nativity,Foreign born,Immigrants,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2024,Are immigrants migrating away from transit?

Row_207,"A central problem in the study of human mobility is that of migration systems. Typically, migration systems are defined as a set of relatively stable movements of people between two or more locations over time. While these emergent systems are expected to vary over time, they ideally contain a stable underlying structure that could be discovered empirically. There have been some notable attempts to formally or informally define migration systems. However, they have been limited by being hard to operationalize and defining migration systems in ways that ignore origin/destination aspects and fail to account for migration dynamics over time. In this work, we propose to employ spatio-temporal tensor co-clustering-that stems from signal processing and machine learning theory-as a novel migration system analysis tool. Tensor co-clustering is designed to cluster entities exhibiting similar patterns across multiple modalities and thus suits our purpose of analyzing spatial migration activities across time. To demonstrate its effectiveness in describing stable migration systems, we first focus on domestic migration between counties in the US from 1990 to 2018. We conduct three case studies on domestic migration, namely, (i) US Metropolitan Areas, (ii) the state of California, and (iii) Louisiana, in which the last focuses on detecting exogenous events such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005. In addition, we also examine a case study at a larger scale, using worldwide international migration data from 200 countries between 1990 and 2015. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of this approach and its limitations.","Almquist, Zack W.","Nguyen, Tri Duc","Sorensen, Mikael","Fu, Xiao","Sidiropoulos, Nicholas D.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Social networks,Network science,Migration,Tensors,Clustering,Dynamic clustering,,,,,,,,,,NOV 6 2024,Uncovering migration systems through spatio-temporal tensor co-clustering

The study aims to address the socio-demographicand economic structure of Turkey's provinces with a multidimensional approach and to analyze them comparatively.

The results of these cluster analyses conducted with different methods at the NUTS-3 level in Turkey include a methodological discussion and a comparative determination. Although there are spatial differences as a result of the analysis of rurality with both socio-demographic and economic variables, the general similarity of the clusters formed by the three methods is significant.

Predictive capability of the model: a minimalistic and easy-to-understand input data set enables preliminary assessments of the implementation of autonomous vehicles for various local governments and suburbs located near metropolitan centres.Abstract An important development task for the suburbs of smart cities is the transition from rigid and economically inefficient public transport to the flexible order-based service with autonomous vehicles. The article proposes a compact model with a minimal input data set to estimate the effective daily travel time (EDTT) of an average resident of a suburban area considering the availability of the first-mile autonomous vehicles (AVs). Our example case is the J & auml;rvek & uuml;la residential area beyond the Tallinn city border. In the model, the transport times of the whole day are estimated on the basis of the forenoon outbound trips. The one-dimensional distance-based spatial model with 5 residential origin zones and 6 destination districts in the city is applied. A crucial simplification is the 3-parameter sub-model of the distribution of distances on the basis of the real mobility statistics. Effective travel times, optionally completed with psycho-physiological stress factors and psychologically perceived financial costs, are calculated for all distances and transportation modes using the characteristic speeds of each mode of transport. A sub-model of switching from 5 traditional transport modes to two AV-assisted modes is defined by an aggregated AV acceptance parameter 'a' based on resident surveys. The main output of the model is the EDTT, dependent on the value of the parameter a.Thanks to the compact and easily adjustable set of input data, the main values of the presented model are its generalizability, predictive ability, and transferability to other similar suburban use cases.","Udal, Andres","Sell, Raivo","Kalda, Krister","Antov, Dago",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,SMART CITIES,autonomous vehicle acceptance,autonomous shuttle vehicle,compact model,distance distribution function,effective travel time,first-mile transport,psycho-physiological stress factor,smart city suburb,travel time model,,,,,,,DEC 2024,A Predictive Compact Model of Effective Travel Time Considering the Implementation of First-Mile Autonomous Mini-Buses in Smart Suburbs

Using data from the new Graduate Outcomes survey and controlling for a rich set of background characteristics, the findings indicate that ethnic minority graduates are more likely than their White counterparts to find work in ethnically diverse areas of the United Kingdom after leaving higher education. An identity utility framework is then formalized that combines identity economics with traditional approaches of human capital theory and job search theory. A test of an ethnic identity-based hypothesis reveals that Asian, Black, and Mixed-background graduates are comparatively more likely to migrate to areas with higher ethnic diversity levels, rather than less diverse areas. In addition to traditional explanations based on human capital theory and job search theory, this paper argues that these patterns are best explained by ethnic identity norms, which introduce a preference for working in ethnically diverse places. However, the results should be interpreted with some caution because of concerns related to heterogeneity within the ethnic group classifications used in the paper and possible omitted and unobserved variables.","Brophy, Sean",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF REGIONAL SCIENCE,ethnicity,graduate migration,identity economics,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2024,Ethnicity and UK graduate migration: An identity economics approach

Yet, the decision-making process behind migrants choosing their destination remains elusive. Existing models primarily rely on population size and travel distance to explain the spatial patterns of migration flows, overlooking significant population heterogeneities. Paradoxically, migrants often travel long distances and to smaller destinations if their diaspora is present in those locations. To address this gap, we propose the diaspora model of migration, incorporating intensity (the number of people moving to a country), and assortativity (the destination within the country). Our model considers only the existing diaspora sizes in the destination country, influencing the probability of migrants selecting a specific residence. Despite its simplicity, our model accurately reproduces the observed stable flow and distribution of migration in Austria (postal code level) and US metropolitan areas, yielding precise estimates of migrant inflow at various geographic scales.

The shortage of homes has decreased affordability, forcing 43 million U.S. households to become renters rather than owners. Racially targeted policies and widespread discrimination, coupled with neoliberal urban renewal policies, have forced communities of color, especially immigrants and the foreign-born, at the greatest disadvantage in homeownership. This paper examines tract-scale disparities in homeownership across major racial/ethnic groups. Using the U.S. Census Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) 2019 definition of the 13-county-metropolitan statistical area (MSA) of Nashville, Tennessee, as the study area, I use five-year American Community Survey (ACS) (2015-2019) data estimates to examine the spatial disparity in homeownership and its predictors. Nashville MSA is one of the fastest-growing southern gateways, and it is also the largest, most diverse, and most intermixed metropolis in Tennessee. It contains higher than the state's overall share of foreign-born, and during 2019-2040, its share of immigrants is projected to grow by 40.7%, making it the best-suited laboratory for race/immigrant-focused research on housing. This analysis finds significant differences in race-based mean per-capita income, with Whites ($32,522) and Asians ($32,556) at the top, whereas Blacks ($25,062) and Hispanics ($20,091) are at the lowest. The ratio of race-based per-capita-income-versus-median housing values is the highest for Whites (15.19) and Asians (15.07) and the lowest for Blacks (11.49) and Hispanics (9.27), putting these two groups as the most disadvantaged regarding their affordability. Regression models suggest lower White homeownership in higher diversity tracts among foreign-born-not-citizens (FBNCs), whereas Black and Hispanic homeownerships are higher in tracts with higher diversity among FBNCs. Interestingly, Asian homeownership is high in tracts with high-income Black tracts, pointing toward the increasing significance of class.","Sharma, Madhuri",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL,homeownership,diversity,Hispanics,Nashville MSA,foreign-born,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2024,Race/Ethnicity and Homeownership in an Emerging Immigrant Gateway of the US Southeast: A Neighborhood Scale Analysis
Row_214,"Due to the increasing demand for goods movement, externalities from freight mobility have attracted much concern among local citizens and policymakers. Freight truck- related crash is one of these externalities and impacts urban freight transportation most drastically. Previous studies have mainly focused on correlation analyses of influencing factors based on crash density/count data, but have paid little attention to the inherent uncertainties of freight truck-related crashes (FTCs) from a spatial perspective. While establishing an interpretable analysis model for freight truck-related accidents that considers uncertainties is of great significance for promoting the robust development of urban freight transportation systems. Hence, this study proposes the concept of FTC hazard (FTCH), and employs the Bayesian neural network (BNN) model based on stochastic variational inference to model uncertainty. Considering the difficulty in interpreting deep learning-based models, this study introduces the local interpretable modelagnostic explanation (LIME) model into the analysis framework to explain the results of the neural network model. This study then verifies the feasibility of the proposed analysis framework using data from California from 2011 to 2020. Results show that FTCHs can be effectively modeled by predicting confidence intervals for effects of built environment factors, in particular demographics, land use, and road network structure. Results based on LIME values indicate the spatial heterogeneity in influence mechanisms on FTCHs between areas within the metropolitan regions and alongside the freeways. These findings may help transport planners and logistic managers develop more effective measures to avoid potential negative effects brought by FTCHs in local communities.

Articulating spacers, which allow joint mobility, often yield better outcomes than static ones. Spacer pharmacokinetics are vital for maintaining therapeutic antibiotic levels, influenced by cement porosity, mixing techniques, and the contact area. Antibiotic choice depends on heat stability, solubility, and impact on cement's mechanical properties. Mechanical properties are crucial, as spacers must withstand physical stresses, with antibiotics potentially affecting these properties.

This paper uses Zhejiang Province as a case study to investigate the spatiotemporal evolution and influencing factors of rural shrinkage from 2000 to 2020. By employing spatial autocorrelation analysis and spatial econometric modeling, the study investigates both population and spatial shrinkage. The findings reveal the following: (1) a marked spatiotemporal imbalance exists in population and spatial dynamics in Zhejiang's rural areas, where the interplay between population and spatial shrinkage contributes to regional disparities. (2) From 2000 to 2020, population shrinkage shifted from a global shrinkage to a more localized decline in the northeast and southwest, while spatial shrinkage shifted from a global non-shrinkage to a focus on central and southwestern areas. (3) Urbanization significantly negatively impacts rural shrinkage, while the spatial spillover effect of urbanization is notably positive. In contrast, factors related to natural conditions, location, and agricultural investment show significant positive effects but also notable negative spatial spillover effects. This study aims to provide a comprehensive analytical framework for understanding rural shrinkage and offers valuable insights for rural development, infrastructure planning, and spatial governance.","Zhuo, Rongrong","Xu, Xinni","Zhou, Yuchen","Guo, Xinwei",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,LAND,rural shrinkage,rural depopulation,spatial shrinkage,urbanization,spatial econometric model,rural China,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,"Spatiotemporal Evolution Patterns and Influencing Factors of Rural Shrinkage Under Rapid Urbanization: A Case Study of Zhejiang Province, China"
Row_217,"Due to very high mobility in the environment and penetration ability into living organisms, nanoparticles (NPs) of urban dust pose a potential threat to human health and urban ecosystems. Currently, data on the chemical composition of NPs of urban dust, their fate in the environment, and corresponding risks are rather limited. In the present work, NPs of deposited urban dust have been comprehensively studied for the first time; NPs isolated from 78 samples of dust collected in Moscow, the largest megacity in Europe, being taken as example. The elemental composition, potential sources as well as environmental, ecological, and health risks of NPs of urban dust are assessed. It is found that dust NPs are extremely enriched by Cu, Hg, Zn, Mo, Sb, and Pb, and can serve as their carrier in urban environments. No regularities in the spatial distribution of elements have been found, probably, due to high mobility of dust NPs. High ecological and health risks caused by dust NPs are demonstrated. Source apportionment study has evaluated one natural and two anthropogenic sources of elements in NPs of urban dust; the contribution of natural and anthropogenic sources being comparable. It is also shown that dust NPs may be considered as an important carrier of trace elements in urban aquatic systems. Additionally, the risks associated with NPs and bulk samples of dust have been compared. The observed risks associated with NPs are significantly higher.","Ivaneev, Alexandr","Brzhezinskiy, Anton","Karandashev, Vasily","Fedyunina, Natalia","Ermolin, Mikhail","Fedotov, Petr",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH,Moscow megacity,Trace elements,Coiled tube field-flow fractionation,Source apportionment,Risk assessment,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,Nanoparticles of dust as an emerging contaminant in urban environments

We used census poverty data and local spatial statistics to identify hot-spots of high concentrated poverty areas and cold-spots of low concentrated poverty located within each SWAN site region, and used linear mixed-effect models to estimate percentage differences (95% confidence interval [CI]) in average BMI and WC levels between neighborhood concentrated poverty categories.Results: After adjusting for individual-level sociodemographics, health-related factors, and residential mobility, compared to residents of moderate concentrated poverty communities, women living in site-specific hot-spots of high concentrated poverty had 1.5% higher (95% CI: 0.6, 2.3) BMI and 1.3% higher (95% CI: 0.5, 2.0) WC levels, whereas women living in cold-spots of low concentrated poverty had 0.7% lower (95% CI: -1.2, -0.1) BMI and 0.3% lower (95% CI: -0.8, 0.2) WC. Site-stratified results remained in largely similar directions to overall estimates, despite wide CIs and small sample sizes.Conclusions: Longitudinal exposure to neighborhood concentrated poverty is associated with slightly higher BMI and WC among women across midlife.","Schiff, Mary D.","Barinas-Mitchell, Emma","Brooks, Maria M.","Mair, Christina F.","Mendez, Dara D.","Naimi, Ashley I.","Hedderson, Monique","Janssen, Imke","Fabio, Anthony",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH,neighborhood poverty,adiposity,midlife,longitudinal analysis,obesity,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 1 2024,Longitudinal Exposure to Neighborhood Concentrated Poverty Contributes to Differences in Adiposity in Midlife Women

Facets studied included frequency of weekly commuting; trip duration to the workplace; trip chaining behavior; usage of public transportation; and utilization of private vehicles. Commuting trips were limited to the home-work-home context, and the research was conducted on adult disabled commuters (aged 17 to 60) in the Jakarta Metropolitan Area (Jabodetabek). A total of 51 commuters with motor and sensory (visual and auditory) disabilities participated in the survey. The results indicate that people with disabilities tend to spend more hours commuting; use public transportation, with the TransJakarta Bus Rapid Transit and paratransit in the form of online motorcycle taxis as the primary modes of transport; and engage in pre-planned trip chaining activities, primarily for visiting family, friends, and clients as well as doing grocery shopping and getting medical treatment. The research findings can serve as valuable resources for developing inclusive transportation policies and planning, such as improving and enhancing access to public transportation for people with disabilities, supporting inclusive training policy in the public transportation field, implementing TOD strategies, and advancing transportation technology to enhance convenience for people with disabilities.","Fitri, Husnul",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF REGIONAL AND CITY PLANNING,Commuting,disabilities,inclusion,public transportation,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 2024,Commuting Behaviors of People with Disabilities and the Implications for Transport Planning and Policy: A Preliminary Study
Row_220,"Limited available market share data seems to suggest that ridesourcing platforms benefit from, even thrive on, socio-economic inequality. We suspect that this is associated with high levels of socio-economic inequality allowing for cheap labour as well as increasing the share of travellers with a considerably above-average willingness to pay for travel time savings and comfort. We test the relation between inequality and system performance by means of an agent-based simulation model representing within-day and day-to-day supply-demand interaction in the ridesourcing market. The model captures travellers' mode choice with a heterogeneous perception of relevant time components, as well as job seekers' participation choice with heterogeneous reservation wage. Our experiments cover scenarios for the entire spectrum ranging from perfect equality to extreme inequality. For several of such scenarios, we explore alternative platform pricing strategies. Our analysis shows a strong, positive relationship between socio-economic inequality and ridesourcing market share. This is the outcome of the combination of cheap labour and time-sensitive ridesourcing users, reinforced by network effects inherent to ridesourcing markets. We find that driver earnings are minimal in urban areas with large socio-economic inequality. In such contexts, drivers are likely to face a high platform commission, and yet, fierce competition for passengers.","de Ruijter, Arjan","Cats, Oded","van Lint, Hans",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 28 2024,Ridesourcing platforms thrive on socio-economic inequality
Row_221,"The robustness of long-distance transport services is paramount for ensuring network connectivity under disruptions. We conduct a comparative analysis of the European rail and air networks of 124 main metropolitan areas, assessing their ability to withstand successive network degradation. We undertake a multi-modal and multi-layer approach in our analysis of the robustness of long-distance transport networks. In particular, we are interested in the role of individual nodes for both air and rail networks as well as for the integrated multi-modal network. Given the hierarchical nature of long-distance transport services, we adopt a multi-layer perspective by means of clustering nodes based on their criticality in order to identify common performance profiles. Original metrics are formulated to measure the impact of nodes on network fragmentation, both at the individual level and as cluster members. Additionally, a new metric is introduced to assess cities' reliance on air transportation, when considering the integrated multi-layer air-rail network during disruptions in air connections. Our findings indicate that the air network exhibits significantly greater robustness compared to rail, i.e. 10% versus 71% performance loss in the worst case scenario, respectively. Furthermore, primary sub-graph of nodes whose protection from attacks can greatly enhance network's overall robustness is identified. We discuss our findings in terms of the relationship between network structure, robustness, and the role of critical nodes as well as propose potential mitigation measures.","Ippolito, Nicola","Cats, Oded",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Network robustness,Targeted and random failures,Rail and air networks,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 6 2024,Multi-modal and multi-layer robustness analysis of the European rail and air networks
Row_222,"In this paper, we present a systematic approach based on dynamic discrete choice models (DDCM) to investigate individuals' forward-looking mode choice behaviours in daily travel tours with multiple destinations. We propose a novel network transformation model that encompasses the entire decision space of all feasible mode combinations for every observed trip/tour in the dataset. By applying the well-established Recursive Logit model structure commonly used in path choice modelling, we address the tour mode choice problem effectively and quantify forward looking considerations in the mode choice process. The proposed model captures the complex considerations individuals take into account when making mode choices. The network transformation incorporates downstream mode limitations into the preceding mode choice options, enabling us to model individuals' forward-looking behaviour and gain insights into how considerations of future trips such as a shopping in the evening, or school pick-up trip influence previous mode choice decisions earlier in the day. Uncovering and quantifying these hidden forward-looking factors can help modellers better explain the private car usage usually observed for the entire sequences of daily trips, even in presence of competitive alternative modes. The proposed network transformation also enables us to measure the effect of the requirement/preference to return private vehicles (car, motorcycle, and bicycle) home on mode choices in home-bound trips, and subsequently, on the entire daily mode choice decisions. To validate the proposed model, we utilise the VISTA household travel survey data from the Melbourne Metropolitan area in Australia. The model is compared against baseline models, demonstrating its statistical advantages. Additionally, intuitive illustrations using the data showcase the model's efficacy. From transport planning and policy perspective, tour-based mode choice modelling provides a more comprehensive and precise understanding of travel behaviour by considering the sequence of trips made by an individual. This can help capture the interactions and dependencies between different trips, which trip-based models may overlook. The proposed model is more suitable for analysing the effects of policy interventions like congestion pricing, public transport investments, or new mobility initiatives, as they can better represent the cascading effects of such policies across multiple trips.","Leong, Joseph","Nassir, Neema","Mohri, Seyed Sina","Sarvi, Majid",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,Recursive logit,Tour mode choice modelling,Discrete choice modelling,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,A dynamic discrete choice modelling approach for forward-looking travel mode choices
Row_223,"Carrion's disease, caused by infection with the bacterium Bartonella bacilliformis (B. bacilliformis), is effectively treated with antibiotics, but reaches fatality rates of similar to 90% if untreated. Current diagnostic methods are limited, insufficiently sensitive, or require laboratory technology unavailable in endemic areas. Electrochemical aptamer-based (E-AB) biosensors provide a potential solution for this unmet need, as these biosensors are portable, sensitive, and can rapidly report the detection of small molecule targets. Here, we developed an E-AB biosensor to detect Pap31, a biomarker of Carrion's disease and an outer membrane protein in B. bacilliformis. We identified an aptamer with Pap31-specific binding affinity using a magnetic pull-down assay with magnetic bead-bound Pap31 and an aptamer library followed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. We incorporated the Pap31-binding aptamer into a DNA oligonucleotide that changes conformation upon binding Pap31. The resultant Pap31 E-AB biosensor produced a rapid, significant, and target-specific electrical current readout in the buffer, demonstrating an apparent K-D of 0.95 nM with a limit of detection of 0.1 nM, and no significant signal change when challenged with off-target proteins. This proof-of-concept Pap31 biosensor design is a first step toward the development of more rapid, sensitive, and portable diagnostic tools for detecting Carrion's disease.","Silver, Keaton","Smith, Andrew","Colling, Haley V.","Tenorio, Nico","Rowland, Teisha J.","Bonham, Andrew J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,SENSORS,aptamer,carrion's disease,E-AB,electrochemical biosensor,neglected tropical disease,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2024,"Electrochemical Aptamer-Based Biosensor for Detecting Pap31, a Biomarker for Carrion's Disease"
Row_224,"Increasing urban traffic congestion and environmental pollution have led to the embrace of bike-sharing for its low-carbon convenience. This study enhances the operational efficiency and environmental benefits of bike-sharing systems by optimizing electronic fences (e-fences). Using bike-sharing order data from Shenzhen, China, a data-driven multi-objective optimization approach is proposed to design the sustainable dynamic capacity of e-fences. A dynamic planning model, solved with an improved Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), adjusts e-fence capacities to match fluctuating user demand, optimizing resource utilization. The results show that an initial placement of 20 bicycles per e-fence provided a balance between cost efficiency and user convenience, with the enterprise cost being approximately 76,000 CNY and an extra walking distance for users of 15.1 m. The optimal number of e-fence sites was determined to be 40 based on the solution algorithm constructed in the study. These sites are strategically located in high-demand areas, such as residential zones, commercial districts, educational institutions, subway stations, and parks. This strategic placement enhances urban mobility and reduces disorderly parking.","Deng, Chen","Ma, Houqiang",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,SUSTAINABILITY,bike sharing,electronic fences,dynamic capacity,NSGA-II,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2024,A Sustainable Dynamic Capacity Estimation Method Based on Bike-Sharing E-Fences

However, transportation is one of the sectors that most impacts sustainability, causing, among other things, emissions of gases, noise, and accidents. Through an integrative bibliographic framework, this study aims to assess the indicators used to evaluate the sustainability of land transportation in various contexts. To this end, relevant papers were selected with intuition to present their main characteristics, and through correlations between the variables analyzed, a framework was built indicating the current situation and future perspectives of the study. In terms of results, some common points were identified among papers, and some categories were pointed out as priorities for a future research agenda, such as the lack of standardization of indicators regarding metrics and nomenclature to emphasize sustainability. A lack of studies covering sustainability as a whole was found, which limits the results of sustainability assessments by only focusing on classic indicators and their deficiencies in relation to social inclusion, political-legal issues, and civil and human rights, as well as the standardization of indicators in other specific sectors.","Goulart, Jose Hugo de Souza","Fidelis, Reginaldo","De Andrade Junior, Pedro Paulo","Horst, Diogo Jose","Marco-Ferreira, Antonio",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,SUSTAINABILITY,analysis tools,coding and classification,integrative literature review,sustainability indicator assessment,transportation evaluation,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2024,Sustainability Assessment Indicators in Land Transportation
Row_226,"The energy transition is driving the adoption of local renewable energy production. Decentralised renewable plants enable citizens to play an active role in generating and managing energy supplies. In Europe, recent policies are promoting Renewable Energy Communities (RECs), which consist of aggregations of end -users aiming to produce and share renewable energy, generating and managing cost-effective energy supply chains autonomously. A comprehensive analysis of REC potential requires tools that integrate socio-economic, environmental, and spatial evaluations for renewable energy assessment. The objective of this study is to present the current status and capabilities of tools for REC modelling. This paper reviews twelve energy modelling tools which have the potential for the evaluation of RECs. The review structure follows the steps of a REC assessment process, which is structured in background, inputs, simulation or optimisation and outputs. Technical, economic, and environmental aspects of REC projects should be included without leaving behind the spatialisation and geographical planning of the new energy systems. Findings reveal that the co -existence of multiple criteria is not satisfied in any of the current tools, as most of them mainly analyse a few areas of interest and partially consider other aspects. The comparison reveals that the energy and financial outputs are mainly deepened. Meanwhile, environmental and spatial criteria have a marginal role among both inputs and outputs. Finally, software marginally spatializes the workflow steps except for CEA and URBANopt, which are revealed to be the most complete options for REC design.","Vecchi, Francesca","Stasi, Roberto","Berardi, Umberto",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,,ENERGY REPORTS,Renewable Energy Communities,energy planning,sustainable cities,energy transition,renewable energy technologies,energy assessment,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2024,Modelling tools for the assessment of Renewable Energy Communities
Row_227,"For a number of years research has been carried out in several centres which has demonstrated the potential benefits of 100-m scale models for a range of meteorological phenomena. More recently, some meteorological services have started to consider seriously the operational implementation of practical hectometric models. Many, but by no means all, of the applications are likely to relate to urban areas, where the enhanced resolution has obvious benefits. This article is concerned with the issues that need to be addressed to bridge the gap between research at 100-m scales and practical models. We highlight a number of key issues that need to be addressed, with suggestions of important avenues for future development. An overarching issue is the high computational cost of these models. Although some ideas to reduce this are presented, it will always be a serious constraint. This means that the benefits of these models over lower resolution ones, or other techniques for generating high-resolution forecasts, will need to be clearly understood, as will the trade-offs with resolution. We discuss issues with model dynamical cores and physics-dynamics coupling. There are a number of challenges around model parameterisations, where some of the traditional problems (e.g., convection) become easier but a number of new challenges (e.g., around surface parameterisations) appear. Observational data at these scales present a challenge and novel types of observations will need to be considered. Data assimilation will be needed for short-range forecasts, but there is currently little knowledge of this, although some of the likely issues are clear. An ensemble approach will be essential in many cases (e.g., convection), but research is needed into ensembles at these scales and significant work on post-processing systems is required to make the best use of models at these grid lengths.Research shows that 100-m scale models can improve the representation of several meteorological phenomena. Here, improved resolution of either the atmosphere or the surface is important for modelling urban hazards. This review article surveys the challenges in transitioning these models into practical forecast systems and suggests ways forward. We consider model dynamics issues, parameterisations, physics-dynamics coupling, and surface representation, along with other aspects required for practical modelling systems, such as sources of surface data, observations, data assimilation, predictability, and post-processing. image","Lean, Humphrey W.","Theeuwes, Natalie E.","Baldauf, Michael","Barkmeijer, Jan","Bessardon, Geoffrey","Blunn, Lewis","Bojarova, Jelena","Boutle, Ian A.","Clark, Peter A.","Demuzere, Matthias","Dueben, Peter","Frogner, Inger-Lise","de Haan, Siebren","Harrison, Dawn","van Heerwaarden, Chiel","Honnert, Rachel","Lock, Adrian","Marsigli, Chiara","Masson, Valery","Mccabe, Anne","van Reeuwijk, Maarten","Roberts, Nigel","Siebesma, Pier","Smolikova, Petra","Yang, Xiaohua",2,,QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY,hectometric modelling,numerical weather prediction,parameterisations,urban,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,The hectometric modelling challenge: Gaps in the current state of the art and ways forward towards the implementation of 100-m scale weather and climate models
Row_228,"The influence of specific local land-use activities (continuously redistributing elements across environments) and environmental conditions (altering the chemical composition of airborne particulate matter) on the intrinsic health risk of PM 2.5 exposure is sparsely reported. To fill this gap, we employed a novel integrated approach to address the influence of short-term changes in source-specific PM 2.5 composition on the exposure-response risk, while controlling for weather conditions. We combine receptor-based source apportionment with conditional logistic regression in a space-time-stratified case-crossover design. This approach is different from previous studies as it: i) controls the impact of spatiotemporal variations in air pollution and human mobility using multilocation-specific fixed and disjointed space-time strata ii) addresses the spatial heterogeneity of personal exposure separating its variable effect from other predictors by allowing different baseline hazards for each space-time stratum; iii) aligns case/control periods with strong/regular episodes of source-specific PM-multi- pollutant fingerprint contributions rather than health outcomes. This enabled comprehensive examination of the association between source-specific PM2.5-bound species and cardiorespiratory disease hospitalizations. The epidemiological findings were that primary anthropogenic emissions [industrial (ORs 2.5 - 4.8)] were associated with higher 1-day moving average PM-induced risks. Natural-related sources [fresh / aged sea salt aerosol, dust, soil resuspension] and secondary sulfate formation were consistently associated with higher health risks (ORs 1.0 - 1.54) after 1 to 5-days since exposure. The results emphasize the importance of source-specific air quality management in complex areas and our research provides an adaptable universal tool to support targeted place- based policy interventions to mitigate air pollution impacts on health.","Silva, Jessica Caroline dos Santos","Potgieter-Vermaak, Sanja","Medeiros, Sandra Helena Westrupp","da Silva, Luiz Vitor","Ferreira, Danielli Ventura","Godoi, Ana Flavia Locateli","Yamamoto, Carlos Itsuo","Godoi, Ricardo Henrique Moreton",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS,Air pollution exposure,Atmospheric chemistry,Case-crossover study,Hospital admission,Water-soluble inorganic ions,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 5 2024,A fingerprint of source-specific health risk of PM2.5-bound components over a coastal industrial city
Row_229,"Mobility is essential for all of us, and the daily routine of the majority is impacted by vehicular transportation. Thus, the ability to predict traffic flow is a challenging task in the field of intelligent transportation systems. However, achieving precise predictions of the state of traffic is a complex undertaking, there are two challenges: 1) Existing studies do not explicitly account for the causal influence of the ""trigger effect"" from contextual conditions on spatial dependencies. 2) Prior methods ignore the fact that there is a time delay in the spread of information in large-scale regions. To address these limitations, we present a novel Graph Structural Causality Spread Delay-aware Model (i.e., GSCSDM) for accurate traffic flow prediction. First, we develop a contextual causality graph that learns the spatial graph structure under the ""triggering effect"". Second, we present a spread time-delay module that captures the information spread delaying triggered by contextual conditions in global regions. Furthermore, we construct a multi-graph fusion matrix to extract spatial correlation from diverse perspectives, which enhances the understanding of regions' state interaction. Experiments on two real datasets demonstrate that GSCSDM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Since the ""trigger effect"" widely exists in practical datasets, the proposed framework may also cast light on other spatial-temporal applications.","Xiong, Yijun","Wang, Huajun",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,IEEE ACCESS,Correlation,Convolutional neural networks,Roads,Predictive models,Traffic control,Heuristic algorithms,Causality graph,contextual conditions,multi-graph convolution,spread time-delay,,,,,,2024,Spatio-Temporal Contextual Conditions Causality and Spread Delay-Aware Modeling for Traffic Flow Prediction
