Row_1,"Urban land use is central to urban planning. With the emergence of urban big data and advances in deep learning methods, several studies have leveraged graph convolutional networks (GCNs) with local functional characteristics from points of interest data and spatial features from flow data to infer urban land use. However, these studies cannot distinguish spatial interaction and spatial dependence in terms of conceptualization and modeling mechanisms and overlook the inadequacy of GCNs in modeling spatial interaction. This study proposes a novel framework-a heterogeneous graph convolutional network (HGCN)-to explicitly account for the spatial demand and supply components embedded in spatial interaction data. Several experiments, including 19 different models and datasets from Shenzhen and London, were conducted to validate the proposed framework and its generalizability within the same and different spatial contexts. The HGCN can distinguish heterogeneous mechanisms in supply- and demand-related modalities of spatial interactions, incorporating both spatial interaction and spatial dependence for urban land-use inference. Empowered by HGCN, we found that spatial interaction features play a distinctively crucial role in urban land-use inference compared to local attributes and spatial dependence features. In addition, our findings highlight the superiority of HGCN-based models in boosting performance and enhancing model transferability.","Gong, Zhaoya","Wang, Chenglong","Chen, Yuting","Liu, Bin","Zhao, Pengjun","Zhou, Zhengzi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE,Heterogeneous graph convolutional networks,spatial interaction,urban land-use modeling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 1 2024,Learning spatial interaction representation with heterogeneous graph convolutional networks for urban land-use inference
Row_2,"Urban Functional regions represent dynamic formations molded by spatial interactions, illustrating the intricate connections between different geographic areas. Identifying functional regions is essential for supporting urban planning efforts and promoting sustainable development. This study presents a comprehensive framework to characterize critical road network locations, integrating structural, functional, and geographical dimensions of the built environment. Addressing limitations in one-dimensional networks and multivariate issues, the study utilizes spatial density-based hotspot detection approaches and develops a method to identify critical locations as multivariate hotspots. Emphasizing critical locations as foundational units for functional regions, it then addresses spatial interaction data limitations through flexible modeling approaches, enhancing local modeling with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) within Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models. Lastly, dynamic spatial interactions are considered using overlapping community detection methods, offering a structured framework for identifying overlapping functional regions in urban landscapes. This study enhances the identification and analysis of urban functional regions, providing deeper insights into spatial complexities and facilitating more effective decision-making for sustainability.","Ghanbari, Marjan","Karimi, Mohammad","Claramunt, Christophe","Lagesse, Claire",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,"WEB AND WIRELESS GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS, W2GIS 2024",Urban functional regions,Road network critical locations,Spatial interaction modeling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024,A Spatial Interaction Model for the Identification of Urban Functional Regions
Row_3,"Spatial interaction centrality reflects the relative importance of population mobility within a location in urban population mobility. Population mobility networks visually represent urban population mobility, with mobility features and network topology contributing to the quantification of spatial interaction centrality of locations (i. e., geographical nodes). However, existing centrality measures rarely consider mobility features and network topology simultaneously. Centrality quantification also ignores the differences in distance effects between longand short-distance trips. These factors have led to the inaccurate quantification of centrality. We propose an algorithm called k-dis-weight-shell that quantifies the spatial interaction centrality of geographical nodes at different spatiotemporal scales. Considering the different effects of distance on long- and short-distance trips, we use a spatial continuous wavelet transformation to estimate the radiation radius of geographical nodes. Then, by combining network topology with mobility features (mobility distance and flow), the algorithm transforms them into a ranked order of spatial interaction centrality. Tested in Wuhan and Chengdu, our algorithm outperforms six existing benchmarks. For cases in urban planning and epidemic management, results show that k-dis-weightshell effectively distinguishes similarities and differences between the distribution of population mobility's spatial interaction centrality and the urban center hierarchy at a coarse spatiotemporal scale. Additionally, it reveals a double wave phenomenon of spatiotemporal correlation between population mobility and COVID-19 transmission before and after lockdown at a fine spatiotemporal scale.","Cai, Jing","Li, Rui","Liu, Zhaohui","Liu, Xinrui","Wu, Huayi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY,Urban population mobility,Geographical nodes quantification,Spatial interaction centrality,Urban planning,Emergency management,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 1 2024,Quantifying spatial interaction centrality in urban population mobility: A mobility feature- and network topology-based locational measure
Row_4,"Western literature shows evidence of a positive relationship between socio-spatial features of neighbourhoods and social interaction. However, there is little research exploring this relationship in the Chinese context, particularly between locals and migrants in peri-urban China where significant housing is being created. This paper studies the socio-spatial features of neighbourhoods in supporting social interaction between locals and migrants across different neighbourhood types in the peri-urban areas in Guangzhou. In this research, data were collected using door-to-door questionnaires and site surveys in 9 peri-urban neighbourhoods in Guangzhou. The nature and strength of relationships between socio-spatial features of neighbourhoods and social interaction were examined through statistical analysis. The results of this study suggest that the level of maintenance and accessibility can help improve social interaction for locals and migrants living together in villages, redeveloped villages, and commodity housing. Neighbourhood boundaries and quality of neighbourhoods were found to be positively related to social interaction for locals and migrants in redeveloped villages only. In addition, the perceived character of the neighbourhood can positively impact social interaction for locals in villages only. This study demonstrates that high-quality neighbourhoods can improve social interaction between migrants and locals in peri-urban villages, commodity housing, and redeveloped villages in China. The study provides a guide for neighbourhood designers, urban planners, and property managers in periurban China regarding how to create a neighbourhood supporting social interaction between locals and migrants in villages, redeveloped villages and commodity housing respectively.","Dai, Linyan","Sheng, Xin","Gupta, Rangan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF URBAN MANAGEMENT,Socio-spatial features,Social interaction,Locals,Migrants,peri-Urban China,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,Socio-spatial features of neighbourhoods supporting social interaction between locals and migrants in peri-urban China
Row_5,"This paper explores the relationship between urban spatial configuration and retail location. We present the Contact model to quantify the capacity of diverse urban configurations to foster economic interactions. Employing a network approach, the model simulates potential interactions between residents and retail activities as they move through the city. The model computes the number of shortest paths, weighted by resident density, in a network loaded with retail activities. The method allows for ranking different urban networks based on their potential to stimulate or constrain interactions between inhabitants and retail establishments. The weighted Contact model is tested across various metric radii in a sample of 35 US cities, utilizing population data from US Census Bureau (c2020) and retail data from the ReferenceUSA database (NAICS, c2020). To validate the model, we correlate results with total retail sales data for each city. Our findings reveal that cities with higher weighted Contact values exhibit greater retail sales volume, particularly within smaller radii up to 1000 m. The differences and relevance of this measurement decreases at >1000 m radius showing that the Contact model is relevant at the local level. We conclude that the urban spatial configuration remains to play an important role in the urban economic environment, holding implications for business and service planning, as well as urban planning and design.","Lima, Leonardo","Maraschin, Clarice","Giaccom, Barbara","Giusti, Cecilia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,CITIES,Contact model,Urban spatial configuration,Retail,Spatial interaction,US cities,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 2024,Urban spatial configuration and interactions with retail activities: An approach based on contact
Row_6,"Understanding the spatial interaction among residents, cooling service, and heat risk area in complex urban areas is conducive to developing targeted management. However, traditional urban thermal environment assessments typically relied on simple linear integration of associated indicators, often neglecting the spatial interaction effect. To explore the spatial interaction among the three elements, this study proposes an accessibility -based urban thermal environment assessment framework. Using Zhengzhou, a rapidly urbanizing city, as an example, remotely sensed images from three periods (2010, 2015 and 2020) were applied to extract urban green space (UGS) and hot island area (HIA). An improved two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method and bivariate local Moran's I were employed to explore whether residents' clustering locations are more likely to access cooling service or to be exposed to heat risk. The results demonstrate that the UGS in the city has been expanding, whereas the HIA shrank within the inner city in 2015 and then increased in 2020. Even though the urban thermal environment may have improved in the last decade, the spatial interaction among the residents, cooling service and heat risk area could be exacerbated. Spatial autocorrelation shows an increase in locations that are disadvantageous for resident congregation. Even when sufficient cooling services were provided, residents in these areas could still be exposed to high heat risk. The developed urban thermal environment framework provides a novel insight into the residents' heat risk exposure and cooling service accessibility, and the findings could assist urban planners in targeting the improvement of extra heat exposure risk locations.","Dong, Xinyu","Li, Xiaoya","Ye, Yanmei","Su, Dan","Yang, Runjia","Lausch, Angela",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,GEOGRAPHY AND SUSTAINABILITY,Urban heat island,Urban green space,Accessibility,Remote sensing,Spatial autocorrelation analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2024,Measuring urban thermal environment from accessibility-based perspective: A case study in a populous city
Row_7,"Rapid urbanization has dramatically changed the urban spatial structures, causing a mismatch between residents' commuting activities and the optimal status of the current urban facility configuration. However, limited attention has been paid to detecting these mismatched commuting patterns and their associations with built environmental characteristics. To maximize the effectiveness of urban facility allocation and improve commuting efficiency, this paper developed a framework to identify anomalous commuting interaction patterns. A weighted bipartite network considering urban land attractiveness was first constructed to analyze the commuting flows between urban units. Then a modified Hungarian algorithm was proposed to obtain the optimal commuting interaction fluxes. By comparing real and optimal interaction fluxes, two types of commuting anomalies were detected. Finally, the machine learning model was used to explore the non-linear relationships between built environment and anomalous commuting patterns. Results show the spatial distribution of areas with significant anomalous interactions and the difference between overload- and underload- related anomalous commuting patterns. Potential urban sub-centers were identified to adjust the urban spatial layouts. Besides, the nonlinear and threshold effects of the built environment on the two anomalous commuting patterns were confirmed, which can provide references for urban spatial renewal and commuting flow allocation.","Tong, Zhaomin","Zhang, Ziyi","An, Rui","Liu, Yaolin","Chen, Huiting","Xu, Jiwei","Fu, Shihang",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Anomalous commuting patterns,Bipartite network,Built environment,Machine learning model,Non-linear effects,,,,,,,,,,,,APR 2024,Detecting anomalous commuting patterns: Mismatch between urban land attractiveness and commuting activities
Row_8,"As interconnectivity within urban agglomeration intensifies, enhancing inter-city economic linkages and resilience to uncertainty shocks has become imperative for economic sustainability. This study measured urban economic resilience, and then unveiled its spatial correlation and heterogeneity at urban agglomeration scale. Social network analysis revealed overall network characteristics and nodes' structural features of the delineated spatially correlated network of economic resilience. Factors driving spatial correlations were explored using QAP regression. Additionally, spatial heterogeneity of economic resilience was analysed, and GeoDetector was employed to determine the impacts of various factors and their interactions. The economic resilience of 26 cities within the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration was calculated. The spatially correlated network exhibits lower density and efficiency. Some cities play central, bridging, and connected roles, while others have limited connectivity, linked to factors like population mobility, spatial adjacency, economic development difference, and knowledge network. During regional integration strategy promotion, significant global spatial autocorrelation is observed, and local spatial autocorrelation reveals heterogeneity in economic resilience. It could be explained by various factors, with nonlinear enhancement effects of two-factor interactions. Recommendations are proposed for enhancing economic resilience by strengthening connections and coordinating despite differences, thus facilitating resilience shaping economic growth and advancing regional sustainability.","Yang, Xiaodong","Li, Huili","Zhang, Jiayu","Niu, Shuyi","Miao, Mengmeng",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11,,SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY,Urban economic resilience,Spatially correlated network,Spatial heterogeneity,Urban agglomeration,,,,,,,,,,,,,APR 2024,Urban economic resilience within the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration: Exploring spatially correlated network and spatial heterogeneity
Row_9,"The shape of cities has historically been the expression of complex processes of material and energy differentiation. Like any open and self-regulating system, it needs to evolve by exchanging flows of information and matter with its environment based on non-linear interactions made up of hierarchies and complementarities necessary for its adaptation. In order to establish causality with the phenomenon of socio-spatial fragmentation, structural inequality has been analyzed as a stratifying factor of spatialities in urban space. The dialectical hermeneutic method has allowed the modeling of concepts from information theory and thermodynamics to explain the interaction logic of the operating subsystems and their consequences in the hybrid structuring of urban space. The identification of cycles and morphogenetic causality in the production of spatialities forms a theoretical-conceptual contribution to the study of urban dynamics when spatial proximity coexists with social distance as a norm.","Ferretti-Ramoss, Mariano A.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,ESTOA-REVISTA DE LA FACULTAD DE ARQUITECTURA Y URBANISMO DE LA UNIVERSIDAD DE CUENCA,urban systems,urban complexity,urban coevolution,urban inequality,socio-spatial fragmentation,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL-DEC 2024,Urban system and complexity.

Row_11,"Understanding spatial interactions in urban environments has become critical in the context of spatio-temporal big data. However, Spatial-temporal big data often exhibit non-uniformity, necessitating the imputation of spatial interaction relationships derived from the analysis of such data. Previous studies often used simplified grid-based or TAZ approaches that ignore the complex interactions for spatial interaction imputation, leading to limitations in accuracy. In this paper, we proposed a two-layer spatial interaction imputation framework (SIF) for accurate multi-scale spatial interaction imputation. To our knowledge, this is the first time that we impute spatial interactions in multi-scale urban areas. In the first layer, it utilised a hierarchical spatial units division algorithm inspired by Shannon's information entropy to hierarchically classify study area using point of interest (POI) data; In the second layer, it integrates the classified areas and travel flow data into a spatial interaction graph convolutional network (SI-GCN) for spatial interaction imputation. Two case studies were conducted in Beijing, China and New York City, USA, using over eight million taxi data and one million bike- sharing data. The results showed the superior performance of SIF compared to baseline models. The results also analysed the travel behaviours in both Cities, as well as the impact of social, economic and environmental factors on passengers' spatial choices when travelling.","Xiao, Zeyu","Gong, Shuhui","Wang, Qirui","Di, Heyan","Jing, Changfeng",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION,Spatial interactions imputation,Travel behaviours analysis,Spatial interaction graph convolutional,network (SI-GCN),Hierarchical zoning of regions,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2024,A two-layer graph-convolutional network for spatial interaction imputation from hierarchical functional regions
Row_12,"Street-view imagery has been densely covering cities. They provide a close-up perspective of the urban physical environment, allowing a comprehensive perception and understanding of cities. There has been a significant amount of effort to represent the urban physical environment based on street view imagery, and this representation has been utilized to study the relationships between the physical environment, human dynamics, and socioeconomic environments. However, there are two key challenges in representing the urban physical environment of streets based on street-view images for downstream tasks. First, current research mainly focuses on the proportions of visual elements within the scene, neglecting the spatial adjacency between them. Second, the spatial dependency and spatial interaction between streets have not been adequately accounted for. These limitations hinder the effective representation and understanding of urban streets. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic graph representation framework based on dual spatial semantics. At the intra-street level, we consider the spatial adjacency relationships of visual elements. Our method dynamically parses visual elements within the scene, achieving context-specific representations. At the inter-street level, we construct two spatial weight matrices by integrating the spatial dependency and the spatial interaction relationships. It could account for the hybrid spatial relationships between streets comprehensively, enhancing the model's ability to represent human dynamics and socioeconomic status. Furthermore, aside from these two modules, we also provide a spatial interpretability analysis tool for downstream tasks. A case study of our research framework shows that our method improves vehicle speed and flow estimation by 2.4% and 6.4%, respectively. This not only indicates that street-view imagery provides rich information about urban transportation but also offers a more accurate and reliable data-driven framework for urban studies.

Row_13,"With the rapid development of smart cities and the swift transition toward digital governance, optimizing urban spatial governance through digital technology remains underexplored in the Global South, particularly from the perspective of resident perception and interaction. Digitization of government services is a key area of interest in digital governance research; this study investigates the impact of government self-service systems on the spatial perception and behavior of residents in Guangzhou and Foshan, China. Through a mixed-method approach, combining questionnaire surveys and semi-structured interviews and analyzing them using a structural equation model, the findings reveal that government self-service systems significantly influence residents' spatial behavior and perception. These systems enhance the efficiency of administrative processes, increase convenience, and lead to temporal-spatial compression, thereby reshaping residents' physical interactions with urban spaces. The findings provide practical insights for policymakers to enhance urban governance by integrating digital technologies to improve residents' interaction with government services. These insights can guide the development of more efficient, resident-centered digital governance frameworks, particularly in rapidly urbanizing regions. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of how digital technology transforms urban spatial governance, highlighting the critical interplay between individuals, technology, and the urban environment.

Therefore, this research aimed to analyze the factors that determine, influence, and map models of lifestyle changes and individual mobility perceptions in socio-economic spatial interactions. Data collection was conducted through observation and a questionnaire from 398 samples in the settlement of Bumi Tamal Anrea Permai and the surroundings. The multivariant statistical analysis methods was used to test the factors and perception mapping with multidimensional scaling was processed with SPSS 25 software. The results showed that individual mobility is characterized by changes in lifestyle and socio-economic, such as increase in private vehicle ownership in suburban. Based on the scenarios created, perceptual model of individual mobility and spatial interaction was formed to determine the increase in private vehicle ownership.

Row_15,"The escalating demand for resources in urban and rural construction development raises the crucial question of achieving green development within limited resource constraints. This study delves into the interplay between environmental policy and green development in urban and rural construction. Utilizing the spatial Durbin model for analysis, findings reveal that investment-oriented environmental regulation significantly impacts green development and positive spillover effects in neighboring regions when considering spatial weight matrices. In contrast, cost-based environmental regulations positively affect green development when spatial interactions are disregarded. However, they exhibit negative effects at the spatial level, potentially leading to a ""pollution relocation"" phenomenon. Although the influence of R& D subsidy-based environmental regulations on green development is not significant, their impact becomes notable upon considering spatial interactions, potentially generating positive effects across regions through mechanisms such as technology diffusion and knowledge transfer. Furthermore, from an endogeneity perspective, the impact of environmental regulatory tools on green development exhibits a time lag effect. Moreover, investment-type regulation in the eastern regions significantly fosters green development, whereas cost-based regulation shows a suppressive effect; investment-type regulation in central regions has a positive spillover on neighboring areas; and R&D subsidies in western regions negatively impact local green development. Moreover, the quality of governmental institutions, market integration, and technological innovation are key factors influencing green development in China's urban and rural construction. This study reveals the direct and indirect effects of various environmental policy tools on green development in urban and rural areas. It emphasizes the importance of considering spatial interactions in implementing environmental policies, providing a theoretical foundation and practical guidance for optimizing environmental policies.","Huang, Yujie","Gan, Jiawu","Liu, Baoliu","Zhao, Kunqian",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,23,,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,Environmental policy,Green development in urban and rural,construction,Spatial durbin model,Technological innovation,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 25 2024,Environmental policy and green development in urban and rural construction: Beggar-thy-neighbor or win-win situation?
Row_16,"The notion of ""spatial vulnerability"" is present in most disaster studies with a strong geographical connotation and accordingly is adopted at all scales, including the urban. While enabling mapping and visualizing risk patterns at macroscales, this geocentric foundation fails to capture disaster risk dynamics associated with the urban spatial network-an element that plays a significant role in the everyday and emergency functioning of cities, enabling users' movement and interaction. Yet, urban vulnerability assessment overlooks this aspect and thus leaves urban disaster risk mechanisms partially unexplored. This study investigated the role of the network of urban public open spaces (UPOS) in the creation and progression of urban disaster risk in earthquake-prone settlements. Through a multimethod approach that integrates quantitative and qualitative methods and explores spatial configuration, planning policies, and practices of use of UPOS in everyday and emergency scenarios, our study demonstrated that UPOS configuration plays an active role in urban disaster risk. Urban public open spaces impact risk by influencing the exposure of pedestrians and their capacity for self-protection. The study further reconceptualized spatial vulnerability at the urban scale, as the fraction of vulnerability associated to the spatial network, highlighting the interplay of planning policies and spatial practices in its production and progression. Our findings make the notion of spatial vulnerability less ambiguous at the urban scale, by viewing the variable as an imbalance in capacities and exposure that generates spatially unsafe conditions. This refined conceptualization of spatial vulnerability becomes a lens for a more granular approach to urban disaster risk reduction and city planning by identifying and integrating sociospatial considerations.","Del Pinto, Monia","Chmutina, Ksenia","Palaiologou, Falli","Bosher, Lee",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK SCIENCE,Central Italy Earthquakes,Pedestrian evacuation,Space syntax,Spatial vulnerability,Urban disaster risk,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2024,The Role of the Spatial Network in Urban Disaster Risk Variations: Reimagining the Notion of Spatial Vulnerability at the Urban Scale

In this context, coastal cities have become vulnerable to climate change-induced extreme weather events and human-made disasters in recent history, where effective measures to improve the resilience of cities are pivotal for developing sustainable living environments. This study proposes a framework for assessing urban resilience to natural disasters (floods) using bottom-up spatial interactions among natural, physical, and social systems within cities and regions. It is noted that seminal studies focus on either the mitigation or adaptation strategies within urban environments to assess disaster resilience, where limited multidisciplinary and operational models hinder evaluations at the city scale. Therefore, urban system interactions and quantifiable parameters proposed in this framework are essential for policymakers and disaster management agencies in the timely allocation of resources to optimize the recovery process. Moreover, spatial planning agencies can adopt resilience mapping to identify the potential risk zones and orient sustainable land use management. Urban resilience can be embodied in spatial strategies with the operational framework proposed here, and future urban growth scenarios can be tested in multiple disaster conditions.","Peiris, Mutu Tantrige Osada Vishvajith",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,SUSTAINABILITY,flood resilience,urban planning,land use change,vulnerability,coping capacity,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,Assessment of Urban Resilience to Floods: A Spatial Planning Framework for Cities

Employing a mixed-method approach, we examine their embedded urban social landscapes through tribal toponyms (landmarks or place names) and evolving urban socio-spatial interactions via demographic concentrations, both as indicators of growing integrations into indigenous urbanscapes. Findings suggest that despite their long-established histories and enduring identities, to a greater or lesser extent, urban tribals are increasingly adapting an outward-pushed urban socio-spatial formation.

A comprehensive understanding of the land economic value of urban blue-green spaces (UBGS) holds immense significance for urban sustainable development, urban spatial justice and the promotion of human well-being. In this study, the MGWR model is employed to discuss the heterogeneous effects of UBGS on housing prices in Hangzhou. Additionally, the interaction effect between blue space and green space was examined at the district level, and the specific locations and spatial patterns were identified. The results show that (1) different types, features and accessibility of UBGS have different degrees and spatial scale of effect on housing prices, and will be affected by other attributes of UBGS; (2) in 30.92% of the main urban area of Hangzhou, the effect of blue spaces and green spaces on housing prices exhibits an interactive effect. The spatial patterns are divided into blue-green positive synergistic, antagonistic and negative synergistic regions; (3) green space has positive and negative effects on housing prices, while blue space has positive effects on housing prices at the regional level.

Row_20,"Rapid urbanization has led to significant changes in ecosystem services (ESs) and thus increased ecological risks. Understating how ESs respond to land use/land cover (LULC) patterns is critical for identifying and controlling ecological risks. However, little is known about the ES patterns, interactions, and drivers at different urban hierarchical scales, posing great challenges for multiscale landscape planning. This study evaluated changes in multiple ESs and identified ecological risks using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs model in the Nanjing metropolitan area at the main urban, city, and metropolitan scales during 2000-2020. Then, ES interactions and drivers at different urban hierarchical scales were explored using Spearman's correlation analysis and the GeoDetector. By integrating the ES information above, a new multiscale landscape planning framework was proposed to mitigate ecological risks at different urban hierarchical scales. The results showed that most ESs have declined due to rapid urbanization. The ecological risks decreased with increasing spatial scale. The ES trade-offs/synergies at the small spatial scale may change at a larger spatial scale. Landscape composition was the dominant driver of ESs at the main urban scale, and the influence of natural factors strengthened with an increasing spatial scale. The construction of blue-green infrastructure is an effective way to mitigate ecological risk, but the effect is scale-dependent. Different urban hierarchical scales may face different ecological risks, and targeted landscape planning should be designed for different urban scales. The multi-scale landscape planning framework proposed in this study helps to identify the most effective landscape planning measures at different urban hierarchical scales. More attention should be paid to landscape configuration at small scales and ecological restoration at large scales.

Numerous research has investigated the impact of landscape composition and structure on urban land surface temperature (LST), yet the spatial clustering and heterogeneity between urbanization and the regional thermal environment remained largely unexplored. Here, we analyzed land use dynamics and LST variations in the Guangxi Beibu Gulf urban agglomeration (GBG_UA) from 2000 to 2020. The spatial relationships between urban expansion and the regional thermal environment were explored by bivariate spatial autocorrelation and coupling coordination degree analysis. The results demonstrated that the land use in the GBG_UA remained relatively stable, except for the expansion of developed land in urban centers. The area of heat island zones clearly increased, leading to an enhancement of the UHI effect. Urban development and the regional thermal environment exhibited a robust positive spatial autocorrelation. The H-H (High-High) and L-L (LowLow) types displayed significant aggregation effects. The H-H cluster areas dominated the central urban cores of prefecture-level cities, while the L-L correlation areas were primarily found in mountainous regions. The overall coupling coordination degree was relatively low, with most areas falling into the moderate dissonance level. While it showed a positive shift, with the regions of concordance levels expanding and coupling coordination degree increased.

It examines humanscale landscapes using a bottom-up metric system that includes eye-level quality, road network design, buildings and functions, and neighborhood location. The methods of deep learning and street view images are utilized to evaluate the eye-level morphology. The study then analyzes the heterogeneous impacts and interaction effects of morphological variables on urban vitality at the community life circle level through multiscale geographic weighted regression and geographical detector model. The findings reveal a core-periphery structure and strong spatial autocorrelations between the morphological variables and urban vitality. Furthermore, the determinants of urban vitality exhibit a blend of global, regional, and local spatial contexts. The human-observed greenery, sky openness, and public bus accessibility demonstrate significant spatial heterogeneity linked to local vitality, whereas street betweenness and commercial facilities exhibit limited effects. The interaction effects between morphological variables can either enhance or weaken their individual impacts, highlighting the need for community life circle planning that considers the combined effects of these variables. This study provides new insights into urban design approaches for promoting revitalization and micro-renewal at the human scale.","He, Sanwei","Zhang, Zhen","Yu, Shan","Xia, Chang","Tung, Chih-Lin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,,APPLIED GEOGRAPHY,Urban vitality,Urban morphology,Community life circles,Geospatial analysis,Human scale,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2024,Investigating the effects of urban morphology on vitality of community life circles using machine learning and geospatial approaches

Previous studies mainly used annual statistical data or online orders, which are criticized for the poor timeliness and data representativeness. This study presents a method to construct freight flow networks by analyzing largesample truck trajectories using spatiotemporal and semantic data mining. The spatiotemporal interaction patterns and influencing factors of intercity freight connections in China are then investigated. Key findings include: (1) The proposed method enables multidimensional and dynamic investigations by constructing timely and refined freight flow networks. (2) The network structure and spatial pattern of freight connections in China show monthly stability, significant spatial heterogeneity, symmetry, and a typical scale-free property. (3) Spatial interaction patterns are related to freight transportation scale. High-freight-volume regions form complete and homogeneous networks with activity space expanding, while low-freight-volume regions exhibit heterogeneity with connections focused on core cities. (4) More than 92 % of the socioeconomic factors exhibit significant nonlinear enhancement when interacting with distance. The nonlinear interaction between economic development level and distance is the most influential, explaining 23.7 %-85.7 % of the connection strength.

Row_24,"Public urban spaces are vital settings for fostering social interaction among people. However, understanding how spatial layouts can promote positive social behaviors remains a critical and debated challenge for urban designers and planners aiming to create socially sustainable environments. Space syntax, a well-established theory and research method, explores the influence of spatial configurations on social aspects. Despite its significant contributions, there is a lack of comprehensive systematic reviews evaluating its effectiveness in enhancing social interaction within urban public spaces. This study aims to identify the existing scientific gaps in the domain of space syntax studies, with a primary focus on sociability in public urban spaces. Following the PRISMA framework, a thorough literature search was conducted in the Scopus database, yielding 1107 relevant articles. After applying screening and eligibility criteria, 26 articles were selected for in-depth review. This review adopted a novel approach to synthesizing and analyzing the findings for identifying underexplored scientific gaps. The findings suggested a wide variety of research gaps to address, encompassing evidence, knowledge, practical, methodological, empirical, theoretical, and target populations to provide a thorough overview of the current state of knowledge in this field. In conclusion, by exploring the interplay between space syntax and design elements such as the urban infrastructure, landscaping, and microclimate in these areas, future research can bridge this gap, particularly when considering a cross-cultural lens. This study underscores the importance of space syntax in promoting social interaction in urban public spaces, offering a robust foundation for future research and practical applications to create more socially engaging environments.","Askarizad, Reza","Dauden, Patxi Jose Lamiquiz","Garau, Chiara",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,,ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION,systematic literature review,PRISMA,social interactions,sociability,space syntax,urban public space,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2024,The Application of Space Syntax to Enhance Sociability in Public Urban Spaces: A Systematic Review
Row_25,"Digital participation relies on computational systems as the instruments for expert engagement, data-driven insight, and informed decision-making. This study aims to increase expert engagement with the Bayesian-based decision support model in evaluating urban vibrancy decisions. In this study, urban vibrancy parameters are defined using ""economic, use, and image value"" measures. This article focuses on the visual aspect of vibrancy, defined as the image value of place. The image value is evaluated through likability and likability features. The case study area is the Eminonu Central Business District in the Istanbul Historic Peninsula due to its distinctive urban dynamics derived from the duality of being a cultural and cosmopolitan city center. This research presents a method as a decision support system (DSS) model based on the Bayesian belief network (BBN) and spatial BBN for supporting urban vibrancy decisions. The spatial BBNs monitor spatial outcomes of variables' dependencies that form through the BBN relationship network. Spatial BBN tools monitors the spatial impact of decisions for informed urban interventions. The results demonstrate that urban greening, pedestrianization, and human-scaled streetscapes should be prioritized to make streets more likable. The most significant intervention areas are Tahtakale for signboard regulation, Sultanahmet and Vefa for cultural landscape improvement, and Vefa and Mahmutpasa for planning building enclosures. The participation is achieved by evaluating urban vibrancy with what-if scenarios using BBN. The developed DSS model addresses which parameters should be prioritized, and what are their spatial consequences. The use of spatial BBN tools presents certain limitations in terms of interoperability and user interaction. Overall, this research contributes to participatory urban planning by incorporating both conditional and spatial dependencies.

The study uses a multidisciplinary approach that includes urban morphology, architectural phenomenology, and sociological study methods to investigate the relationships between spatial organization and decision-making processes on both the macro and micro levels of decision-making. The purpose is to look at how collective action decision-making processes affect the urban fabric and how social norms influence spatial organization at different levels. The study applies case study and spatial analysis approaches to investigate how the traditional settlements' spatial structure promotes peace among the inhabitants while also sustaining cultural traditions. The qualitative approach investigates how spatial arrangements influence behaviors, developing a better understanding of how residents interact with their surroundings. According to the study's findings, these spatial layouts sustain customs and assist communities in adapting to environmental changes by retaining cultural activities. The study identifies the significance of balancing development with the retention of important traditional values in the implementation of long-term urban conservation plans.

However, few studies investigate the cooling capacity (CC) of small UGI and how their spatial organization influences its provision. Here, we used an urban cooling model and landscape metrics to understand how UGI in public and private domains influences microclimate regulation in a dense urban region of Rio de Janeiro. Our findings highlight the significant correlation between private UGI and CC, explaining over 80 % of its variation. We found an interaction between UGI composition (i.e. the amount of UGI) and configuration (i.e. spatial distribution of UGI). Nevertheless, UGI configuration exerted the greatest influence with edge density being the most significant landscape metric, suggesting that, with an equivalent green area, patchwork or numerous smaller green areas enhance CC compared to fewer larger ones. This study underscores the pivotal role of private UGI organization in tropical and dense urban context, where public UGI is neglected. We conclude that UGI awareness initiatives must systematically pay attention to spatial configuration of the small UGI, aligning interventions with urban dwellers' needs in order to guarantee microclimate regulation provision.","Silveira, Carson","Amaral, Felipe Goncalves","Dias, Andre Tavares Correa","de Gois, Givanildo","Piston, Nuria",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY,Microclimate regulation,Cooling capacity,Nature-based solutions,Urban green infrastructure,Urban tree cover,Spatial configuration,Suburbs,,,,,,,,,,OCT 1 2024,The importance of private gardens and their spatial composition and configuration to urban heat island mitigation

A deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the urban heat island phenomenon is essentially beneficial for providing scientific supports towards improving the urban thermal environment. To address the challenge of effectively depicting the complex interactions among urban environment factors, this study employed the Peter-Clark causal discovery algorithm to analyze the causal structure of urban thermal driving factors, and validated the effectiveness of the 6 key factors directly influencing the surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII). In response to the inadequacy of existing big data causal inference tools in assessing the spatial heterogeneity of causal effects, this study proposed a method for evaluating the causal effects on SUHII and their spatial heterogeneity based on local analysis and geospatial causal principle. The result for 4 different intervention scenarios in this study show that there is obvious spatial heterogeneity in the causal effects of different interventions on SUHII in Wuhan, and that increasing greenery and preserving natural environments is an effective way to mitigate the urban heat island (UHI) effect.

Row_29,"Spatially explicit population data is critical to investigating human -nature interactions, identifying at -risk populations, and informing sustainable management and policy decisions. Most long-term global population data have three main limitations: 1) they were estimated with simple scaling or trend extrapolation methods which are not able to capture detailed population variation spatially and temporally; 2) the rate of urbanization and the spatial patterns of settlement changes were not fully considered; and 3) the spatial resolution is generally coarse. To address these limitations, we proposed a framework for large-scale spatially explicit downscaling of populations from census data and projecting future population distributions under different Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP) scenarios with the consideration of distinctive changes in urban extent. We downscaled urban and rural population separately and considered urban spatial sprawl in downscaling and projection. Treating urban and rural populations as distinct but interconnected entities, we constructed a random forest model to downscale historical populations and designed a gravity -based population potential model to project future population changes at the grid level.

Thus, it worth asking whether it is possible to speak of utopias and the virtuality of the utopia of an urban-natural considering the contemporary dystopian scenery. Understanding that another urban-nature relationship in a transformative horizon demands other spatial practices and the (de)construction of everyday life, this essay examines a series of urban greening alternative initiatives. Despite their shared intentions, these interventions have dissonant agendas. Therefore, effort is made to differentiate them according to their character, degree sanction, and their potential outcomes to effectively benefit vulnerable social groups sheltered from gentrification and hegemonic interests. A distinction is made between the reformist practices of tactical urbanism and the transformative initiatives of different interactions with nature conducted by communities vulnerable social groups and social movements, among others, with or without the support of public authorities, in addition to actions of guerrilla urbanism, pointing to the flourishing of other spatial practices and other daily life.

Row_31,"It is crucial for urban greening studies to comprehend the spatial synergy effect of the urban green space ecosystem on air pollution and the heat island effect. However, there are limited studies that have considered the impact of green space ecosystems on different air pollutants and urban heat island effects across different seasons from an urban space perspective. Therefore, this study took an urban space perspective and established a high-precision spatial grid with a resolution of 500 m. The spatial econometric regression and bivariate local Moran's I test were employed to analyze the impacts of urban green space ecosystems on air pollutants (including summer ozone (O3) concentration, winter fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration and winter inhalable particulate matter (PM10) concentration) and heat islands in summer and winter. The results showed that the spatial regression coefficients between green space and heat islands, PM2.5 concentration and PM10 concentration are significantly negative, - 0.00049***, -0.00329***, and -0.00365*, respectively. The urban green space ecosystems are observed to effectively mitigate the heat island effect and help to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 pollution in winter. There are 88 high-high clustering in the spatial interactions between green space and ozone concentration in summer, that is, the grids with high O3 concentration surrounded by the high green space grids. It implies that urban green space ecosystems can significantly increase O3 pollution in summer. This study reveals that low BVOCs tree species should be widely planted in urban green spaces, while large-scale green space parks should be established in the urban region to continuously increase the proportion of green space. This study would contribute to improving the awareness of the government and relevant employees on scientific urban greening methods.","Han, Li","Zhang, Ruijun","Wang, Junqi","Cao, Shi-Jie",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,URBAN CLIMATE,Green space ecosystem,Spatial econometric regression,Air pollution,Heat island effect,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 2024,Spatial synergistic effect of urban green space ecosystem on air pollution and heat island effect

This study innovatively investigated the interactive feedback between UCL and RCL transition. First, a theoretical analytical framework was proposed. Second, a spatial simultaneous equation model (SSEM) was employed to examine the interactive feedback between UCL and RCL transitions in Jiangsu Province, China, from 2000 to 2020. The main findings were as follows: The interactive feedback between UCL and RCL transitions followed two paths. The first interactive feedback path was driven by the interaction of urban and rural factors, whereas the second was driven by the integrated management of urban and rural land. UCL and RCL transition witnessed a positive interactive feedback relation. Specifically, a 1% increase in UCL transition led to a 0.535% increase in RCL transition, and a 1% increase in RCL transition resulted in a 0.579% increase in UCL transition. The two aspects exhibited complex spatial interaction effects. The UCL transition in the subject city had positive and negative effects on the UCL and RCL transitions of neighboring cities, respectively. The RCL transition had positive effect on the RCL transition in neighboring cities. The key to regulation is to make the mutual feedback pathways unobstructed through innovative policies in terms of both direct and indirect regulation.

Row_33,"As the rapid urban expansion and the rise of consumer society, urban fringe areas have become an essential place for urban capital to intervene and achieve spatial regeneration, and it has triggered the consumerization and transformation of space. Taking Guangming Town in the urban fringe area of Shenzhen as an example, this paper reveals the process and dynamics of spatial consumerization transformation under the influence of capital intervention. It examines the intricate mechanisms of capital operation underlie the production of space, and endeavors to explore a novel model of rural spatial regeneration in China's urban fringe areas. This paper found that the production of space in Guangming Town under the capital intervention includes the material production and social relations production. With the reconstruction of spatial form and relationships, new local products, spatial configuration, social services and organizational relations are generated, forming a consumption space with heterogeneous landscape, market institutionalized management, commercialization and symbolization. The realization of the production of consumption space in urban fringe areas is based on the joint action of core elements such as land, capital and government, which provide the material foundation, operational power and coordination organization for space consumption. These promote capital to complete the triple cycle of ""acquiring land - creating space scarcity - realizing space consumption"", and then realizing space reproduction and capital appreciation. In the Chinese context, the spatial transformation and production of urban fringe areas should not be regarded as a local practice of Western counter-urbanization or rural gentrification theory. Rather, it as a new spatial regeneration mode that harmonizes urban and rural production, lifestyles and development trajectories.

Row_35,"Rail transit plays a crucial role in improving urban sustainability and livability. In many Chinese cities, the planning of rail transit routes and stations is focused on facilitating new developments rather than revitalizing existing built-up areas. This approach reflects the local governments' expectations of substantial growth to reshape the urban structure. However, existing research on transit-oriented development (TOD) rarely explores the spatial interactions between individual transit stations and investigates how they can be integrated to achieve synergistic effects and balanced development. This study proposes that rail transit systems impact urban structure through two ""forces"": the provision of additional and reliable carrying capacity and the reduction of travel time between locations. Metro passenger flow is used as a proxy for these forces, and community detection techniques are employed to identify the actual and optimal spatial clusters in Wuhan, China. The results reveal that the planned sub-centers align reasonably well with the optimal spatial clusters in terms of spatial configuration. However, the actual spatial clusters tend to have longer internal travel times compared to the optimal clusters. Further exploration suggests the need for equalizing land use density within planned spatial clusters served by the metro system. Additionally, promoting concentrated, differentiated, and mixed functional arrangements in metro station areas with low passenger flows within the planned clusters could be beneficial. This paper presents a new framework for investigating urban spatial clusters influenced by a metro system.","Xiao, Longzhu","Xu, Wangtu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT,urban spatial clusters,metro travel flows,land use,metro smartcard data,Wuhan,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2024,Urban spatial cluster structure in metro travel networks: An explorative study of Wuhan using big and open data

Concurrently, we selected environmental, spatial structure, and housing economic indicators to construct a regression analysis. Our findings revealed that urban villagers exhibit a preference for shorter daily commutes, underscoring the positive role of UVs in promoting job-housing balance and providing diverse services. The high-frequency mobility of villagers accelerates the categorization of UVs and enhances intra-area circulation. We further discussed the interaction between UV renewal and its destigmatization. To counter spatial stigmatization, enhancing the spatial quality and infrastructure of UVs, as well as promoting diversified land use can reduce the public's stereotypical impressions. Moreover, prioritizing affordable housing and equitable distribution of facilities, along with fostering synergies between urban capital and UVs, can facilitate the destigmatization process.

This study explores the heterogeneities of land development in the administrative ranking system and realizes the justification of the administrative spillover effect on land development at the township level, using urban-rural fringe areas in Wuhan and neighboring cities in China as the case study area. Multi-schemes of spatial adjacencies among the subdistricts and towns have been devised to probe into the differences in their synergies and cooperations in developing land. Land development intensity gauged by the proportion of construction land has shown great spatial heterogeneity between subdistricts and towns, with a high impervious and urbanized land proximate to the urban center. Spatial interaction is more pronounced when two subdistricts are adjacent in the same municipality and is the least powerful when the subdistrict is adjacent to the town, verifying the close horizontal relationships of the local governments, as well as the administrative barriers at the different administrative ranks in the spatial governance system. In addition, local socio-economic development and the locational preferences for political centers and medical facilities have been identified as important influencing factors.

The study explored the degree of coupling, the level of coordinated development, and the dynamic development trend between TSDI and CDCC from the perspective of coupling coordination. Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) Region was used as a case study and it was found 1) there is a higher degree of coupling, and high correlation between TSDI and CDCC in the BTH urban agglomeration region; 2) the BTH region has the highest number of cities with coordination levels on the verge of maladjustment, followed by ones with barely coordinated cities; 3) while the overall level of coordination gradually increases, the overall deviation degree of development of TSDI and CDCC in the BTH urban agglomeration region is gradually decreasing; 4) there is an interactive coercion relationship between TSDI and CDCC in the BTH urban agglomeration region.

The complex interactions between Pressure, State, and Response form a nested cycle of UER, indicating that the UER in the Yangtze River Delta is evolving towards a more rational development trend, where the tight mechanism of societal Response plays a key role. The implications underscore the urgent need for tailored regional governance strategies that leverage spatial variations, balance human impact on ecosystems, and optimize dimensional interactions for resilient city development.

Row_44,"Extreme meteorological events and rapid urbanization have led to serious urban flooding problems. Characterizing spatial variations in flooding susceptibility and elucidating its driving factors are essential for preventing damages from urban pluvial flooding. However, conventional methods, limited by spatial heterogeneity and the intricate mechanisms of urban flooding, frequently demonstrated a deficiency in precision when assessing flooding susceptibility in dense urban areas. Therefore, this study proposed a novel framework for an integrated assessment of urban flood susceptibility, based on a comprehensive cascade modeling chain consisting of XGBoost, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) in combination with Kmeans. It aimed to recognize the specific influence of urban morphology and the spatial patterns of flooding risk agglomeration under different rainfall scenarios in high-density urban areas. The XGBoost model demonstrated enhanced accuracy and robustness relative to other three benchmark models: RF, SVR, and BPDNN. This superiority was effectively validated during both training and independent testing in Shenzhen. The results indicated that urban 3D morphology characteristics were the dominant factors for waterlogging magnitude, which occupied 46.02 % of relative contribution. Through PDP analysis, multi-staged trends highlighted critical thresholds and interactions between significant indicators like building congestion degree (BCD) and floor area ratio (FAR). Specifically, optimal intervals like BCD between 0 and 0.075 coupled with FAR values between 0.5 and 1 have the potential to substantially mitigate flooding risks. These findings emphasize the need for strategic building configuration within urban planning frameworks. In terms of the spatial-temporal assessment, a significant aggregation effect of high-risk areas that prone to prolonged duration or high-intensity rainfall scenarios emerged in the old urban districts. The approach in the present study provides quantitative insights into waterlogging adaptation strategies for sustainable urban planning and design.","Zhou, Shiqi","Jia, Weiyi","Wang, Mo","Liu, Zhiyu","Wang, Yuankai","Wu, Zhiqiang",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,Flooding susceptibility assessment,Urban morphology,XGBoost,Interpretation algorithm,Spatial agglomeration analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,"Synergistic assessment of multi-scenario urban waterlogging through data-driven decoupling analysis in high-density urban areas: A case study in Shenzhen, China"

Row_47,"Canton (present-day Guangzhou, China) has a long history as a trading port and serves as a window for studying the history of Sino-Western cultural exchanges. Canton was a city built under Confucian orders, leading to significant differences (when compared to Christian cities) in urban functional zoning, layout, urban landscape, and methods for shaping spatial order. Therefore, the churches constructed by Christian missionary societies in Canton merit particular attention in missionary history research and urban planning history. Based on local gazetteers, historical maps, export paintings, Western travelogues, and archives at that time, from a cultural landscape perspective, this article compares and analyzes the spatial expansion of Christian churches and their influences on the urban landscape in Canton in two stages. In the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, the spatial layout of the churches indicated an active integration into Canton City. After the Opium War, churches were not only used for religious purposes but also served as symbols asserting the presence of Christians and Western powers (which made the situation more complicated). Missionary societies attracted believers through the construction of public facilities, building Christian communities centered around churches, thereby competing with authorities for spatial power and influencing the urban functional system and spatial layout controlled by the authorities. Comparatively, the Roman Catholic Cathedral has profoundly changed the traditional landscape order in Canton, while the Protestant Dongshan Church interacted more closely with the city.","Li, Yonggu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,RELIGIONS,Christian churches,Canton,historic urban landscapes,Sino-Western interactions,Protestantism and Catholicism,Christian communities,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,"Spatial Expansion, Planning, and Their Influences on the Urban Landscape of Christian Churches in Canton (1582-1732 and 1844-1911)"
Row_48,"With the development of urban agglomerations in China, the study of the interactions between cities has become a popular and difficult issue. Exploring the interactions between cities can help decision-makers optimize regional resource allocation and improve regional spatial patterns. Combining the urban flow model and the patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model, this study simulates and analyzes the process of urban expansion in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, and investigates the impact of urban hierarchical structure differences on urban expansion. In this study, the role and influence of inter-city economy flow, transportation flow, population flow, and information flow on the development of urban agglomerations are comprehensively considered, and a multilevel urban interaction model is constructed based on a hierarchical generalized linear model (HGLM). Based on the national BTH cooperation and development strategy, a multi-scenario simulation study of urban expansion is carried out using the HGLM-PLUS model. The results indicate the following: (1) compared to the traditional PLUS model, the coupled HGLM-PLUS model, which considers multilevel urban flows, improved the overall accuracy by 0.047, the Kappa coefficient by 0.207, and the figure of merit (FoM) index by 0.051; (2) under different simulation scenarios, the development trend under the cooperation and development policy in the BTH region is more stable, demonstrating a relatively smooth urbanization expansion trend; and (3) under the BTH cooperation and development background, the total area of construction land in the BTH region is expected to be maintained at around 1,164,500 km2 by 2040.

Row_49,"Urban-rural interlaced zones are characterized by the interpenetration of urban and rural elements, drastic changes in construction, relatively weak planning and management, and anthropogenic activities that constantly impact the ecological background. However, the ecological barriers and hinterland spaces of the city center provide important ecological functions. In this study, we selected forest birds as indicator species of the urban ecological environment and explored the spatial stratification and heterogeneity effects of environmental substrates and anthropogenic activities on bird diversity (species richness, abundance, Shannon-Wiener index, and Simpson index) in urban-rural interlaced zones using the optimal parameter geographic detector model to characterize the changes in ecological functions in these zones. The results of this study are as follows: (1) The bird diversity index in Minhang District, Shanghai, showed an obvious urban-rural gradient divergence with the transition of urban zone- rural-urban interface - rural zone. An agglomerative spatial differentiation pattern was observed more in the southeast but less in the northwest, with a high degree of spatial distribution concentrations and evident imbalance characteristics. (2) The spatially stratified heterogeneity in bird diversity in urban-rural interlaced zones was because of the combined action of multiple driving factors under the three dimensions of habitat environment, degree of urbanization, and anthropogenic interference. Most of the interactions between any two factors showed non-linear or bifactorial enhancement effects. Furthermore, the one-factor explanatory power of urbanization and anthropogenic interference factors on bird diversity was significantly higher than that of the habitat environment factor. (3) Population heat distribution (PD), distance to the center of Shanghai (DC), and nighttime lighting index (NTL) were the main drivers of spatially stratified heterogeneity in bird diversity and the key indicators of urban-rural gradient changes. The interaction between PD and DC had the strongest explanatory power for the spatial differentiation of bird diversity.","Wang, Di","Zhang, Lang","Yu, Haoran","Zhong, Qicheng","Zhang, Guilian","Chen, Xuanying","Zhang, Qingping",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS,Optimal parameter geographic detector,(OPGD),Bird diversity,Urban-rural interlaced zone,Driving factor,Citizen observation data,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2024,Attributing spatially stratified heterogeneity in biodiversity of urban-rural interlaced zones based on the OPGD model

Using a socio-spatial analytics approach and mechanism theory, we compare rural- urban land use dynamics (RULD) in Kunshan and Nanhai, located in the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta regions respectively. The study analyzes factors driving RULD changes through actors' practices, attributing differences to globalization timing, land rights consciousness, and resulting path dependencies. These elements have shaped political-commercial alliances and land development norms, leading to inconsistent RULD over time. Two key arguments emerge: First, contemporary RULD divergence stems from socioeconomic transitions, distinct from environmental constraints in agrarian societies. Second, this divergence reflects cross-scale state- market-society interactions at the macro level, while resulting from multi-scale actor negotiations at the micro level.

As an important criterion for residents' social interaction and mobility vigor, collective walking describes the results of walking activities in streets and positively correlates with the built environments. However, limited attention has been given to the contribution of built environment factors in peri-urban areas towards promoting collective walking. Therefore, this study employed multisource data to assess the impact of these factors on collective walking in peri-urban areas. Our analysis delved into the impact of these factors on collective walking across various urban spaces and explored intervention effects through cross-classification studies that prioritize planning strategies. These results revealed that (1) The impacts of the built environment on collective walking behavior differs in peri-urban areas. (2) Diversity and distance only show significant impacts in peri-urban areas. (3) A distinct spatial mismatch between urban spatial form and collective walking behavior is observed. Subsequent urban design interventions should consider these spatial distribution differences for prioritized zoning planning.

Row_53,"Traditional urban simulation models often fail to adequately integrate crucial spatial population dynamics with land use, significantly limiting their effectiveness in supporting comprehensive urban spatial optimization. This study addresses this critical gap by developing an innovative model that couple's population-land simulation with macro and micro data for more sustainable urban land planning. Our method employs pre-simulated urban land data and leverages existing population data, while utilizing Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) sub-modules to accurately simulate crucial urban land development decision-making processes, including job location selection, commuting preferences, and choices of residential locations. These sub-modules are adept at reflecting natural limitations and capturing the socio-economic interactions of both working and non-working residents in urban settings. At the macro-scale, the Geographic Micro-process Model (GMP) assesses spatial variations in urban population and land. To optimize population distribution, our model incorporates controls that leverage social networking effects and urban capacity constraints at the micro-scale. Furthermore, by exploring the coupling relationship between urban population and land using the GMP model, our study has predicted population distribution under various land expansion scenarios (Compact, Sprawl and Stable). The application of this model in Wuhan, China, shows good convergence with the Curve Discrepancy Index (CDI), achieving a Pixel-level Precision Value (PPV) of 0.7466 and Elastic Tolerance Index (ETI) values of 0.9109, 0.9061, and 0.8846, with corresponding tolerance coefficients of 0.2, 0.1, and 0.01, demonstrating the overall robustness and reliability of our model.

Row_54,"The urban heat island (UHI) effect has evolved into one of the key environmental problems affecting the urban ecological environment and sustainable development. Based on 52 Urban Thermal Heat spots (UTHSs) with significant differences between land use structure and urban green infrastructure (UGI) spatial layout within the influence range of UHI in Shanghai, Landsat-8/9 satellite images were used to construct a high-dimensional dataset reflecting the impact of built environment components on urban thermal environment. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to analyze the spatial difference qualitatively. Using the stepwise regression (SWR) model and partial least square regression (PLSR) model, the complex response relationship between UGI's structure/spatial pattern differentiation and urban thermal environment in three spatial stratification ranges of UTHSs was quantitatively analyzed. Overall, the statistical explanatory power of the PLSR model is much better than the stepwise regression model. The PLSR model points out that moderately increasing the average building height, class area (CA), percentage of landscape (PLAND), landscape shape index (LSI), and largest patch index (LPI) play a positive role in inhibiting the growth of land surface temperature (LST), and the cooling effect of index weights decreases in order. However, the interaction effects of the box-cox transformed indices with underlines, e.g., CA x Cohesion x AI x LPI and PLAND x CA x Cohesion x AI x LPI, exert relatively small weight on the cooling effect.

Interaction effects show that FICA combined with other factors can enhance intervention success. The spatial distribution of forcibly displaced persons (FDPs) negatively impacts policy implementation. Enhancing city authorities' financial autonomy could improve DSFS success. Policymakers should target strategic interventions that address FDP needs, consider urban spatial challenges, and incorporate climate-inclusive financing models.

Row_57,"Vector cellular automata (VCA) models, which excel at representing spatiotemporal dynamics of irregularly shaped land parcels, have been widely employed in land use change simulations. However, current research faces the following issues: (1) most VCA models neglect the spatial heterogeneity of driving factors within each land parcel when evaluating the environmental driving effects; (2) when calculating the neighborhood effects, simple statistics of land use types in neighboring parcels are often used, overlooking the influence of driving factors within neighboring parcels; (3) the ability to explore the interactions between land parcels is often limited. To address the aforementioned issues, this study proposes a HashGAT-VCA model for investigating urban land use changes. The model utilizes a Hash function to encode the non-uniform distribution of each driving factor within each irregularly shaped land parcel into a fixed-length vector, and constructs a graph structure between land parcels based on their spatial topological relationships. By employing a Graph Attention Network (GAT), the model explores the mechanisms of environmental driving effects and inter-parcel interactions to calculate the probability of land use change for each parcel. The proposed HashGAT-VCA model was applied to simulate urban land use changes in Shenzhen, China, from 2009 to 2012. Compared to other VCA models, the HashGAT-VCA demonstrated higher simulation accuracy. The results indicated that HashGAT-VCA can effectively capture the impacts of the heterogeneously distributed driving factors and the interactions between land parcels on land use changes.

This study takes the Beibu Gulf urban agglomeration, a national-level model area for integrated land and sea development in China, as an example to investigate the spatial heterogeneity of CLIU and explore its driving factors through multiple econometrical and geographical methods, including identifying its underlying mechanisms. The results indicate that (1) the CLIU index is 0.334, its Gini coefficient is 0.183, and its comprehensive level has a low intensity and obvious spatial nonequilibrium characteristics. Hypervariable density (50.33%) and the intraprovincial gap (45.6%) are the main sources.

The interaction effects of two factors primarily manifested as nonlinear enhancements, with the interaction between the labor force index and multiple cropping index being particularly noteworthy (0.859). (3) The geographically weighted regression coefficients reveal that temperature (0.332), multiple cropping index (0.211), and labor force index (0.209) have relatively large and positive impacts on CLIU, while slope (-0.1), precipitation (-0.087), and population urbanization (-0.039) have relatively small and negative impacts; all factors exhibit spatial nonstationarity. The spatial heterogeneity of CLIU in the Beibu Gulf urban agglomeration is characterized by patterns' nonequilibrium and factors' nonstationarity.

Nevertheless, the spatial differentiation of greenness among major cities of China and its evolution process and drivers are still poorly understood. This study examined the spatial patterns of vegetation greenness across 289 cities in China in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2018 by using spatial autocorrelation analysis on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); then, the influencing factors were analyzed by using the optimal parameters -based geographical detector (OPGD) model and 18 natural and anthropogenic indicators. The findings demonstrated a noticeable rise in the overall greenness of the selected cities during 2000-2018. The cities in northwest China and east China exhibited the rapidest and slowest greening, respectively, among the six sub -regions. A significant positive spatial correlation was detected between the greenness of the 289 cities in different periods, but the correlation strength weakened over time. The hot and very hot spots in southern and eastern China gradually shifted to the southwest. While the spatial pattern of urban greenness in China is primarily influenced by wind speed (WS) and precipitation (PRE), the interaction between PRE and gross domestic product (GDP) has the highest explanatory power. The explanatory power of most natural factors decreased and, conversely, the influence of anthropogenic factors generally increased. These findings emphasize the variations in the influence strength of multiple factors on urban greenness pattern, which should be taken into account to understand and adapt to the changing urban ecosystem.","Jin, Yansong","Wang, Fei","Zong, Quanli","Jin, Kai","Liu, Chunxia","Qin, Peng",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,GEOGRAPHY AND SUSTAINABILITY,Vegetation greenness,Spatial heterogeneity,Influencing factors,Geographical detector,Urban areas,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2024,Spatial patterns and driving forces of urban vegetation greenness in China: A case study comprising 289 cities

For the urban construction of Pingdingshan City, regression analysis is used to point out the different situations with other cities from the perspective of quantitative analysis. The results show that the commercial point density is positively correlated with the global integration degree and negatively correlated with the total depth value.

Addressing a notable gap in previous UFV research, which predominantly focused on spatial characteristics while overlooking temporal dynamics, we introduce a novel framework for spatiotemporal UFV assessment, by presenting a multiplicative equation to elucidate the interaction between Urban Flood Susceptibility (UFS) and Vulnerable Entities (VE). Employing this framework in the Great Bay Area (GBA), by considering the composition of the UFV database, we leveraged Machine Learnings and the Urban Vitality Index for quantifying the UFS and VE, respectively. SHapley Additive exPlanations was employed to quantify the local contributions of various factors to UFV. We found (1) a discernible upward trajectory in UFV across the GBA from 2012 to 2020, coupled with an expansion in spatial scope, indicative of persistent challenges in the future, and (2) the impervious surface percentage emerges as the primary contributor to UFV, exhibiting spatial heterogeneity reflective of regional environments. We believe this study has the potential to significantly contribute to addressing UF challenges and fostering the development of sustainable cities.","Tang, Xianzhe","Huang, Xi","Tian, Juwei","Pan, Senyuan","Ding, Xue","Zhou, Qiaowei","Sun, Chuanzhun",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY,Urban Flood Vulnerability,Machine learning,Spatiotemporal distribution,SHapley Additive exPlanations,,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 15 2024,A novel framework for the spatiotemporal assessment of urban flood vulnerability

With the aim of operationally managing such complexity, scholars have recently started uneasy research toward the construction of system architectures to support informed and aware policymaking. In particular, agentbased modelling efforts have been developed using the so-called applied ontologies. These models appear promising towards supporting complex relational and cognitive interactions in processes of urban decisions. Increasing simulation and experimentation activities are now oriented towards the support of ontologybased spatial planning processes in the real world. In the current planning context, where natural discourses and narrations are embedded in participatory plans, useful answers can also be provided by the narrations of some literary works, in the aforementioned sense. The work we have carried out explores the spatial representations included in those narratives, trying to develop ontological analyzes based on complex structuring characters and features of the represented urban spaces. The work is based on multi -agent experiments carried out with university students, who have extracted some passages from literary works dealing with urban environments.

The findings indicate a high likelihood of rural-to-urban migration, leading to increased urbanization pressure and depopulation of rural areas in the country, further worsened by high mortality and low fertility rates. Socioeconomic and environmental factors, including population size, wages, employment, housing availability and precipitation, have a significant impact on migration flows, and the effects tend to vary according to whether the origin and destination are rural or urban.

However, most of the existing studies ignore the temporal dependence of the spatial pattern evolution of CEE and the scale variability of the factors influencing CEE. With the help of an exploratory spatiotemporal data analysis framework, this paper examined the spatiotemporal interactions of CEE across 110 cities in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB). In addition, a multiscale geographically weighted regression model was employed to reveal the scale effects of influencing factors on CEE. The main conclusions are as follows: first, the CEE of cities in the YREB shows a fluctuating upward trend, but the overall level is still low, and a certain polarization phenomenon exists. Second, the spatial pattern of the CEE of cities in the YREB is generally relatively stable, with strong spatial integration and path dependence. Finally, the factors influencing CEE exhibit obvious scale variability and spatial heterogeneity.

Row_69,"Urbanization has led to the rapid formation of novel biotic communities, which via interspecific interactions, may affect niche partitioning dynamics of native, sensitive species. The endangered San Joaquin kit fox (Vulpes macrotis mutica; hereafter 'kit fox') is a small mesocarnivore inhabiting urban areas of the southern Central Valley of California alongside other urban mesocarnivores. These other species may pose challenges for kit foxes due to a potential lack of evolved mechanisms of defense or avoidance. To address this notion, we evaluated evidence of temporal and spatial partitioning between the kit fox and its potential predators and competitors in an urban environment. We predicted that spatial and temporal overlap would be lower between kit foxes and their predators than with their competitors. We used camera traps with scent lures at high school and college campuses across the southern San Joaquin Valley to monitor the visitation patterns of urban mesocarnivores from 2020 to 2022. We used generalized linear mixed models and AIC model selection to evaluate spatial relationships between kit foxes and other mesocarnivores and we used temporal overlap coefficients and peak activity analysis to evaluate temporal overlap. Kit foxes exhibited low spatial overlap (negative association) with Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana) and high spatial overlap (positive association) with domestic cats (Felis catus), domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), northern raccoons (Procyon lotor), and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis). Kit foxes exhibited low to moderate levels of temporal overlap with other species, the least of which occurring with potential predators (i.e., coyotes (C. latrans), domestic dogs). Our findings support the temporal partitioning and partially support the spatial partitioning hypothesis as potential mechanisms to promote coexistence among mesocarnivores in an urban environment.","Alipio, Camille","McCullah-Boozer, Megan R.","Gaete, Caroline L.","Hall, Lucas K.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,Camera trap,Kit fox,Mesocarnivore,Urban,Temporal partitioning,Spatial partitioning,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,Spatiotemporal partitioning between the endangered San Joaquin kit fox and a novel mesocarnivore community in the urban environment as revealed by camera traps

Against India's swift urbanization, several urban areas exhibit the coexistence of escalating populace and expansion in developed regions alongside extensive spatial heterogeneity. The interaction mechanism between the growth of urban areas and the expansion of cities holds immense importance for the remediation of air pollution. Henceforth, the present investigation utilizes geographically weighted regression (GWR) to examine the influence of urban expansion and population growth on air quality. The examination will use a decade of data on the variation in PM2.5 levels from 2010 to 2020 in eight Indian metropolitan cities. The study's findings demonstrate a spatial heterogeneity between urban growth dynamics and air pollution levels. Urban growth and the expansion of cities demonstrate notable positive impacts on air quality, although the growth of infilling within expanding urban areas can significantly affect air quality.

This paper proposes a novel scheme to predict the trajectory of the target vehicle driving on urban main roads efficiently and accurately. Inspired by the substantial impact of road geometry on vehicle trajectory, we delve into three feature input methods to encode vehicle features. We integrate a multi-head attention mechanism for weighting map features. Following this, we utilize an attention gating mechanism to merge map features with the vehicle's dynamic features. Spatial and temporal attention mechanisms are employed to extract the spatial-temporal interaction features of the vehicle. We evaluate the proposed method on the Argoverse Motion Prediction dataset and the INTERACTION dataset. Compared to VectorNet, our proposed model achieves a reduction of 10.8% in Average Displacement Error (ADE) and 14.8% in Final Displacement Error (FDE), respectively.

Among the key players in these environments, cable bacteria interfere directly with C/N/S/O cycling, and are closely associated with phylogenetically diverse microorganisms in anoxic sediment as an electron conduit to mediate long-distance electron transport from deep -anoxic -layer sulfide to oxic-layer oxygen. Despite their hypothesized importance in blackodorous urban rivers, the spatial distribution patterns and roles of cable bacteria in large-scale polluted urban rivers remain inadequately understood. This study examined the diversity and spatial distribution pattern of cable bacteria in sediment samples from 186 black -odorous urban rivers across China. Results revealed the coexistence of two well -characterized cable bacteria (i.e., Candidatus Electrothrix and Candidatus Electronema), with Candidatus Electrothrix exhibiting a comparatively wider distribution in the polluted urban rivers. Concentrations of DOC, SS, sulfate, nitrate, and heavy metals (e.g., Ni and Cr) were correlated with the cable bacteria diversity, indicating their essential role in biogeochemical cycles. The activation energy of cable bacteria was 0.624 eV, close to the canonical 0.65 eV. Furthermore, cable bacteria were identified as key connectors and module hubs, closely associated with denitrifiers, sulfate -reducing bacteria, methanogens and alkane degraders, highlighting their role as keystone functional lineages in the contaminated urban rivers. Our study provided the first large-scale and comprehensive insight into the cable bacteria diversity, spatial distribution, and their essential function as keystone species in organic -matter -polluted urban rivers.","Wu, Bo","Liu, Feifei","Liang, Zhiwei","Wang, Chen","Wang, Shanquan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,Cable bacteria,Biogeography,Urban river,Organic matter pollution,Interspecific interaction,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 10 2024,Spatial distribution of cable bacteria in nationwide organic-matter-polluted urban rivers in China

However, most scholars have always paid attention to the exploration of the driving mechanisms of the spontaneous process. While for the self-organized process, most simulations based on cellular automata (CA) simply abstract it as the clustering process between land use types, ignoring the important role of human behaviors in urban growth. This study presents a framework that integrates a size-adaptive strategy with the multi-agent system (MAS) to establish a neighborhood with stakeholders' interactions (NSI). We employed the CA with NSI (Nsi-CA) to simulate the urban growth of Wuhan from 2000 to 2020 and analyzed its performance. The findings indicate that Nsi-CA performs better than the commonly used CA models at both local and global scales, with an increase in global Figure of Merit (FoM) of about 11.5 %.

To investigate the drivers of the spatial differentiation in GVI in urban areas, the GVI was calculated based on Baidu street view images and semantic segmentation in Futian District, Shenzhen, and its spatial variation characteristics were explored. The dominant influencing factors of GVI were analyzed and screened by applying the Pearson correlation coefficient and optimal parameters-based geographical detector (OPGD). The results showed that the overall GVI was high in the study area, with an average value of approximately 28%. The scale effect of GVI was not obvious, but the spatial heterogeneity was distinct, and the hot spots and cold spots of GVI had an evident clustered distribution. The spatial variation of GVI was influenced by the vegetation cover, landscape pattern, built environment and socioeconomic factors. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was the most dominant factor affecting the spatial differentiation of GVI, followed by land cover, fractal dimension index, patch area, building density and proximity. Furthermore, the interaction of the influencing factors had a higher degree of explanation than a single factor. In highly urbanized areas, exploring the factors affecting the spatial differentiation of GVI can provide a basis for optimizing the layout and structure of green spaces, contributing to a better perception and quality of urban greening.","Zhang, Weiyan","Zeng, Hui",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9,,URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING,Green view index,Influencing factors,Landscape pattern,Street view image,Urban area,Optimal parameters -based geographical,detector,,,,,,,,,,MAR 2024,"Spatial differentiation characteristics and influencing factors of the green view index in urban areas based on street view images: A case study of Futian District, Shenzhen, China"

The proposed method combines two approaches to assessing provision: predicting the number of interactions and evaluating provision according to regulatory requirements, as well as assessing the diversity of non-standardized urban services. The approach based on reducing the predicting of interactions to the knapsack problem using the Graph-Sage graph neural network architecture showed the best performance in evaluating provision with standardized services.

Informal green spaces (IGS) have been identified as a potential solution to this, offering unscripted opportunities for urban residents to engage with nature in a way that is not possible in formally planned parks and gardens. Despite an increasing focus on IGS, we are still developing our understanding of the extent to which people use these spaces to interact with nature. Our work addresses this research gap by employing a spatial analysis method to map IGS within Greater Melbourne, Australia. We used citizen science data to analyse the location and density of human-nature interactions on IGS compared to formal green spaces, as well as comparing different types of IGS and formal green spaces. Our findings revealed no significant difference in the density of citizen science observations between IGS and formal green spaces, once the variance in available area of each land use is accounted for. Notably, railway and utility easements exhibited the highest density of citizen science observations among all types of IGS.

However, the complexity of interactions among urban spatial units has impeded further research on UCEs. This study investigates synergistic emission reduction between cities by analyzing the spatial complexity within the UCEs network. The future potential for synergistic carbon emissions reduction is predicted by the link prediction algorithm. A case study conducted in the Pearl River Basin of China demonstrates that the UCEs network has a complex spatial structure, and the synergistic capacity of emission reduction among cities is enhanced. The core cities in the UCEs network, including Dongguan, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou, have spillover effects that contribute to synergistic emission reduction. Community detection reveals that the common characteristics associated with UCEs become concentrated, thereby enhancing the synergy of joint efforts between cities. The link prediction algorithm indicates a high probability of strengthened carbon emission connections in the Pearl River Delta, alongside those between upstream cities, which shows potential in forecasting synergistic emission reductions.

This information, mainly available from geotechnical surveys, can be integrated into spatial databases to produce operational models. Aiming to generate strategies that enable the visualisation of underground properties in highly anthropised environments, the following four-phase methodology has been proposed: (a) Gathering of geotechnical data; (b) Spatial and statistical analysis; (c) Database design; (d) Generation of 2D and 3D models. Following the aforementioned criteria and using open sources, a spatial dataset of 650 points located within the historical centre of Seville (Spain) has been developed. This urban area is characterised by the heterogeneous distribution of its soil layers and their geotechnical properties. The results show that the application of this method enables a prompt and efficient display of the distribution of geotechnical layers in urban and metropolitan environments, by considering the variations in their mechanical properties. This simplified approach therefore establishes a new starting point for the development of predictive strategies based on approaches of a more complex nature that facilitate the analysis of the interactions between subsoil, buildings, and infrastructures.","Soriano-Cuesta, Cristina","Romero-Hernandez, Rocio","Mascort-Albea, Emilio J.","Kada, Martin","Fuls, Andreas","Jaramillo-Morilla, Antonio",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,REMOTE SENSING,microzoning,urban geotechnical maps,Geographic Information Systems (GIS),LIDAR,Digital Soil Modelling,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2024,Evaluation of Open Geotechnical Knowledge in Urban Environments for 3D Modelling of the City of Seville (Spain)

But why choose green innovation as the driver for urban eco-efficiency? How did it do? Based on ecological civilization demonstration zone in China (Yangtze River Economic Belt) city data from 2006 to 2019. This research developed comprehensive evaluation systems to measure both urban green innovation and ecoefficiency, making use of the SBM model with undesired output to gauge ecological efficiency of urban areas. On this basis, we extended analysis by applying a baseline regression model and a Spatial Durbin model to delve into the mechanisms of green innovation affects eco-efficiency. The results are as follows. (1) green innovation and urban eco-efficiency showed fluctuating upward trends but that regional heterogeneity existed among the three regions. Specifically, the lower reaches outperform in green innovation, closely followed by the middle and upper reaches. Concurrently, the eco-efficiency levels of the middle reaches surpass those of the lower and upper reaches.

In the Algerian context, the topic of public open spaces has been extensively investigated. However, little research has examined how spatial and physical attributes of recreational open spaces influence their use and perceptions by residents. This study investigated the role of urban planning and urban design in shaping livable recreational open spaces in Souk Ahras City, Algeria. The study used a mixed-methods approach: spatial analysis was used to map five typologies, while a survey among 426 residents was used to assess the residents' satisfaction, use, and perception of recreational open spaces. Although several recreational spaces have been, their availability was insufficient. In addition, satisfaction levels with the spatial and physical attributes of recreational open spaces were mainly average to low. Moreover, satisfaction was positively correlated to use frequency, duration, and favorable perception, highlighting the importance of the design quality of those spaces. However, satisfaction did not predict activities undertaken, underscoring the need for considering more than just the physical aspect when new recreational open spaces are proposed. Recommendations include increasing provision and improving spatial and physical attributes.

Row_92,"There are complex interactions among urban spatial elements in rainstorm scenarios. Road interruptions may cause isolation between partially submerged buildings and emergency service facilities, thereby affecting the recovery capability of flooded buildings and the accessibility of emergency service facilities. This study constructed a compound spatial network of urban buildings-roads-emergency service facilities, and analyzed the complex dynamic impacts of time-varying dynamic floods on building risk, road risk, and emergency service accessibility. Firstly, a refined flood risk assessment at the building scale was carried out in combination with flood inundation, building vulnerability, population, vulnerable areas, underground buildings, and life facilities. Secondly, betweenness centrality indicator in complex networks was used to calculate road traffic capacity and collapse threshold, and the accessibility of emergency service facilities is calculated based on road traffic capacity. Finally, the interaction and feedback relationships between the compound spatial network were analyzed. The results show that: (1) Flooded building comprehensive risk analysis reveals that floods have a significant impact on residential and commercial land use, and high-risk flood areas are mainly concentrated in the central region of study area. (2) The road network has a collapse threshold, and the fluctuating state of emergency service accessibility is significantly influenced by road traffic capacity. (3) Roads act as ""bridges"" connecting buildings and emergency service facilities, leading to the redistribution of building flood comprehensive risk and emergency service accessibility, presenting complex dynamic changes over time. Additionally, submerged roads also affect the accessibility of emergency service facilities around flooded buildings, reducing the recovery capacity of flooded buildings, and exhibiting significant heterogeneity characteristics.

Amid rapid urbanization, maintaining and expanding green spaces has become increasingly challenging, especially in densely populated urban centers. This research utilizes remote sensing data and Point of Interest (POI) data to assess how different types of urban amenities influence UGS dynamics based on geospatial analytics. The study focuses on the central districts of Guangzhou, a city facing significant urban development pressures, to provide a nuanced understanding of these interactions. Employing both Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression and Random Forest (RF) models, the analysis examines the impact of 23 categories of POIs on the spatial and temporal changes in UGS. Key findings reveal that amenities such as auto repair shops, shopping services, and transit facilities are negatively correlated with UGS, indicating that their presence may contribute to the reduction in green space. Conversely, amenities like scenic spots and life services show a positive correlation, suggesting they might support the preservation or expansion of green spaces. The results underscore the dual role of urban amenities in both supporting and constraining green space development, highlighting the need for carefully balanced urban planning strategies. This study provides valuable insights for policymakers and urban planners aiming to promote sustainable urban growth while preserving essential green spaces, ensuring that urban environments remain livable and ecologically resilient.","Zhang, Shawei","Chen, Jiawen","Cai, Yuxuan","Wen, Yuhan","Niu, Jiaqi","Chen, Mingze",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION,urban green spaces,urban amenities,remote sensing,spatial analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,Assessing the Association Between Urban Amenities and Urban Green Space Transformation in Guangzhou

Neglecting the MAUP could lead to an incomplete understanding of LST changes and their driving mechanisms. This study used optimal parameters-based geographical detector and gradient boosting regressor models to investigate the MAUP in LST and its influencing factors. The analysis covered 87 cities across seven climate zones in China, examining MAUP in 12 spatial scales to discern the scale and zoning effects on LST and its influencing factors. The research findings were as follows: (1) The sensitivity of LST influencing factors to spatial scales exhibited both spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Significant differences in the q-values of LST influencing factors were observed across various climate zones and periods (daytime and nighttime), with human factors, particularly those related to residents' work, buildings, life, and rest, showing higher spatial scale dependency than natural factors. (2) Zoning effects significantly impacted the q-values of LST influencing factors and were closely linked to the discretization methods and quantities used, which could alter the trends of these q-values. (3) Across the 12 spatial scales, more than 67.34 % of LST influencing factor interaction types were classified as bi-variable enhancement types. The q-values for LST influencing factor interactions were higher and more stable than those of single factors. LST influencing factor interactions in transitional climate zones exhibited high sensitivity to spatial scales.

This study proposes a new barycenter formula-based multivariate spatial-temporal collaborative relationship model for identifying the complex relationships and interactions among the water footprint (WF), carbon footprint (CF), and gross domestic product (GDP) in the three largest urban agglomerations in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) of China. A nonlinear grey Bernoulli model is then advanced for illustrating the future evolution in WF-CF-GDP and their multivariate collaborative relationship. Results reveal that WF and CF of all urban agglomerations increase continuously, with annual growth rates of 0.59% and 5.63%, respectively. WF, CF, and GDP are significantly positively correlated, and they exhibit similar spatial clustering characteristics and centroid migration directions along the main course of the Yangtze River. Moreover, their multivariate temporal collaborative relationship (0.79) significantly surpasses their spatial (0.63), while the spatial-temporal (0.77) is intermediate. WF has the greatest impact on the binary spatial-temporal collaborative relationship between CF and GDP. In contrast, GDP has the least impact on the relationship between CF and WF. The projected WF, CF, and GDP indicate that the YREB will face more severe water and carbon pressures as its economy grows. Their multivariate spatial-temporal collaborative relationships are projected to decrease by 10.26% in 2050.

Effective heat reduction and adaptation strategies rely on a thorough understanding of urban heat island (UHI) dynamics, which vary within cities and over time due to local urban form and meteorological conditions. While existing studies have examined the spatiotemporal structure of UHIs, they have not examined the space-time variability of air temperature at high spatial and temporal resolutions. This study addresses this gap by utilizing a ground-based sensor network of 53 iButton thermochrons, synoptic weather stations, and satellites to capture these spatiotemporal patterns. Using these data, we developed generalized additive models to predict daily, daytime and nighttime air temperature anomalies throughout Baltimore City. We found that 1) meteorological variables are more influential in characterizing the nighttime UHI than the daytime UHI; 2) spatiotemporal variability of nighttime UHIs is greatest in areas with sparse vegetation canopy cover; and 3) interactions between urban form and meteorology have a systematic but modest impact on the spatial structure of UHIs.

Promoting their benign development is the key to realizing global sustainable development of urban and rural areas. Planning control is based on precisely defining the spatial extent of suburban areas, and understanding suburban area differentiation and its driving forces scientifically is a key component in raising the bar for focused planning. However, there are currently few research on fine-scale quantitative identification of suburban regions because of their spatial complexity, ambiguous boundaries, and structural dynamic features. Based on this, this paper develops a multi-dimensional identification index system for suburban areas by using multi-source big data and remote sensing information technology, employs the random forest model and the K-Medoids clustering algorithm, identifies the distribution of suburban areas and their subdivided types, analyzes spatial differentiation characteristics, and conducts empirical research using Chengdu City as an example. The findings demonstrate that: (1) The majority of suburban areas in Chengdu City are concentrated in groups or belts surrounding the urban centers of various districts and counties, and the higher the functional class of a district or county, the denser the distribution of suburban areas. (2)The distribution pattern of suburban areas in Chengdu basically conforms to its planned urban hierarchy system.(3)Urban-oriented, suburban-interacted and rural-oriented suburban areas have their own characteristics in land use level, economic development and regional population characteristics.(4)Regional openness, government behavior, social development and geographical location are the core driving factors of spatial differentiation of suburban areas in Chengdu, and the interaction between urban and rural systems, the flow of social resources and the transformation of development models are the spatial mapping dimensions that affect its differentiation.(5)Chengdu can draw up detailed regulatory planning of suburban units to standardize and guide the overall development of suburban areas.

Parks, street greening, and community greens play a significant role in regulating the urban microenvironment, enhancing subjective well-being, and increasing regional attractiveness. Additionally, urban greenbelts have the capacity to control urban sprawl, thereby influencing housing prices and population distribution. However, the exisiting urban models have typically addressed greenbelts and other green spaces in isolation, resulting in fragmented planning strategies. This study aims to establish a novel spatial equilibrium model that accurately assesses the socio-economic effects resulting from the combined impact of various urban green spaces. This model encompasses green infrastructure components and carefully balances their appeal against the consequent rise in housing costs. The proposed model can elucidate the latent synergistic interactions among multiple urban green policies, which enables urban policymakers to access the multifaceted impacts of greening policy combinations. and suggests that combining different urban greening policies can mitigate the negative effects of a single policy type, such as population redistribution. A case study based on empirical data from Shanghai, China, has been employed to identify the additional value associated with diverse urban green spaces. The scenario analysis suggests that combining different urban greening policies can alleviate the negative impacts of urban population relocation. These findings furnish urban planners and policymakers with novel insights to develop the distribution strategy of urban green spaces via judicious policy integration.

As a manifestation of spatial arrangement in mature urban growth, the ecological challenges within urban agglomerations and their surroundings deserve attention. Therefore, clarifying the interrelation within the ESV and urbanization is crucial to constructing sustainable progress-oriented cities. Previous researches on the coordination relationship between ESV and urbanization have been limited to the provincial and county levels, and insufficient consideration has been given to the differences across urban and rural areas at different scales. Utilizing the coupling coordination degree (CCD) model, the present investigation assesses the interplay between urbanization and ESV across various scales within the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration (YRDUA) region from 2000 to 2020, and explores the differences in their distributions throughout the urban-rural gradient, aiming to help the regional coordinated development. The findings indicate that from 2000 to 2010, with increasing intensity of land use, the ESV in YRDUA area decreased. But between 2010 and 2020, ESV increased. Moreover, the CCD in the YRDUA has a positive relationship across ESV and urbanization, and is in a status of primary coordination from 2000 to 2020, with a slow upward trajectory. Meanwhile, along the rural-urban gradient, ESV and CCD both are declining, and there is a significant plunge from suburban to urban. And the interactions between ESV and urbanization have obvious spatial heterogeneity, which tends to show the coordination at broader scales, such as provincial and county levels, while manifesting conflicts at finer scales, such as the grid scale.

Using MODIS LST data and the Geodetector model, we compared the spatiotemporal variations of LST and their drivers in super megacities (Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Shenzhen), a megacity (Xi'an), large cities (Urumqi and Harbin), and a small and medium-sized city (Lhasa). The LST of super megacities is primarily influenced by socioeconomic factors (11 %- 61 %), whereas natural factors significantly impact the LST of large cities and small to mediumsized cities (15 %-58 %). Socioeconomic factors contributed more significantly to daytime LST in Xi'an (68 %). Elevation is a crucial factor influencing the spatial heterogeneity of LST, and the enhanced vegetation index predominantly dictates the spatial variation of LST through its interactions with other factors. The interaction between various factors significantly enhances their contributions to LST. According to the urban heat island ratio index, Lhasa exhibited the highest urban heat stress risk (>0.83) during both day and night, whereas Harbin displayed the lowest (<0.34).

This is manifested in the use of derogatory social categories to refer especially to younger inhabitants and in forms of symbolic distancing among neighbors. The results underscore the moral dimension of stigma and its role in the construction of symbolic and social boundaries in contexts of urban relegation.

Initially, using collected street view images, street spatial elements are extracted through deep learning algorithms. Subsequently, integrating multiple data sources, machine learning methods are employed to quantify the impact and interactions of the built environment on street vitality. Illustrated with the case of Dingshu, the feasibility of this process is demonstrated. By examining the correlation and underlying mechanisms between the built environment and street vitality, this study aids decision-makers in leveraging technological means to expedite design processes and create human-centric cities.","Li, Jinze","Song, Zhehao","Wen, Jian","Cai, Chenyi","Tang, Peng",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 29TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTER-AIDED ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN RESEARCH IN ASIA, CAADRIA 2024, VOL 2",,Nonlinear Relationship,Built Environment,Street Vitality,GBDT-SHAP,Interaction Effect,,,,,,,,,,,,2024,EXPLORING NONLINEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND STREET VITALITY USING MACHINE LEARNING

This analysis thus well-indicates that merely supplying greater amount of commodities of any kind does not necessarily reflect greater complementarity and vice versa.

This study investigates the institutional factors driving urban sprawl in China through a case study of Wuhan, exploring the impact of influential governmental bodies on the spatiotemporal characteristics of urban sprawl as reflected in stringent policy implementations and top -down planning institutions. By employing spatial measurements, statistical analysis, and policy interpretation based on extensive fieldwork data, we observed a marked intensification of leapfrogging urban land expansion accompanied by the encroachment of agricultural land between 1996 and 2014 in Wuhan. These transformations are predominantly attributable to a two-tiered institutional mechanism comprised of central -local and intra-city institutional changes. Temporal shifts in spatial expansion have been heavily influenced by the interplay between central transitional development policies and corresponding local planning responses. The choice of specific locations for land sprawl is governed by the interaction of different government levels, each focusing on local development strategies and land institutional arrangements. These findings offer novel insights into the global discourse surrounding the state -market relations in addressing urban sprawl and achieving sustainable urbanization.","Zhu, Jiren","Tu, Yong","Zhu, Jieming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,CITIES,Institution-driven urban sprawl,State-market relations,Transitional development policy,Intra-city institutional change,Local planning response,Wuhan,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 2024,Institution-driven urban sprawl in China: Evidence from Wuhan

The complex interaction between ICT on urban space presents challenges in understanding their relationships. This study aims to discover the empirical evidence of the spatial variance of urban space linked to ICT. To pursue this objective, this study defines spaces that leverage ICT-based activities as Digitally Accessible Spaces (DAS), and choose restaurants that provide online reservation services through NAVER, which is the most dominant search engine in South Korea. Based on fundamental measurements in location theory, we stratified the entire area in Seoul into four groups in order of profitability. Using the location quotient (LQ), we quantified the locational characteristics of DAS compared to overall restaurants. Consequently, three measurements, which are density of marketplace, distance from public transit, and proper land use, indicate that the second-tier profitable areas commonly possess the largest portion of DAS. These characteristics provided empirical evidence supporting previous studies highlighting the liberation effect and altered travel behavior resulting from ICT-based activity through qualitative and theoretical approaches.

The reduction in mobility, decreased social interactions, and heightened uncertainty, negatively affected the public's emotional well-being. As restrictions eased, many countries transitioned towards a new normal. Understanding the connection between public attitude and urban mobility during the recovery phase is crucial for the planning of resilience urban environment. This study investigates the changes in urban mobility and public attitudes by analyzing public transportation and social media data. Findings indicate a significant increase in mobility during the recovery compared to the semi-lockdown period, with better resilience to subsequent outbreaks. Commercial areas and major public transit interchanges exhibited stronger recovery in mobility after new (sub)variants waves. Train mobility demonstrated robust recovery. Relaxation in April 2022 played a crucial role in increased mobility and reduced negative feelings. This policy shift contributed to a surge in positive emotions, particularly in locations where individuals could engage in social and recreational activities. Moreover, the increased beyond- neighborhood mobility was related to decreased negative emotions during the easing of restrictions.

Using a combination of several measurement models such as the BCG (Boston Consulting Group) matrix, ESDA (Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis), MLR (Machine Learning Regression), GWR (Geographically Weighted Regression), and GeoDetector, this paper presents an empirical study on the changes in Urban Park Green Areas (UPGAs) in the Grand Canal of China. By quantitatively measuring the spatio-temporal evolution patterns of UPGAs, this study reveals the driving mechanisms behind them and proposes policy recommendations for planning and management based on performance evaluation. The spatio-temporal evolution of UPGAs and their performance in China's Grand Canal are characterized by significant spatial heterogeneity and correlation, with diversified development patterns such as HH (High-scale-High-growth), HL (High-scale-Low-growth), LH (Low-scale-High-growth), and LL (Low-scale-Low-growth) emerging. The evolution performance is dominated by positive oversupply and positive equilibrium, where undersupply coexists with oversupply. Therefore, this paper recommends the implementation of a zoning strategy in the future spatial planning of ecological green areas, urban parks, and green infrastructure. It is also recommended to design differentiated construction strategies and management policies for each zoning area, while promoting inter-city mutual cooperation in the joint preparation and implementation of integrated symbiosis planning. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal evolution of the UPGAs in the Grand Canal of China is influenced by many factors with very complex dynamic mechanisms, and there are significant differences in the nature, intensity, spatial effects, and interaction effects between different factors. Therefore, in the future management of ecological green areas, urban parks, and green infrastructure, it is necessary to interconnect policies to enhance their synergies in population, aging, industry and economy, and ecological civilization to maximize the policy performance.","Cai, Zihan","Zhao, Sidong","Huang, Mengshi","Zhang, Congguo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,LAND,urban park,evolution mode,driving mechanism,spatial planning,grand canal,China,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2024,"Evolution Model, Mechanism, and Performance of Urban Park Green Areas in the Grand Canal of China"

As a result, urban areas are expected to undergo further anthropogenic transformations, which will not only influence spatial development (i.e. sealing urban systems) but also affect local climatic conditions. One likely consequence is the increasing incidence of adverse interactions between two phenomena occurring in city centers, which can have a significant impact on human quality of life: urban heat islands (UHI) and urban pollution islands (UPI). Here, we review scientific research relating to the interaction of UHI and UPI. Two basic databases were used: Web of Science and Scopus. The literature review covers publications appearing between 1968 and 2022 (Web of Science: 1300 related to 'heat island', 18,222 on 'air pollution'; Scopus: 4393 on 'heat island' and 34,498 on 'air pollution'), in fields such as environmental studies and meteorology studies. A significant number of the published articles were focused on cities located in Asia, Europe, and North America. Our findings show increasing research interest in UHI-UPI interactions, reflecting the risks they pose in the modern world-not only to human health and life, but also to the ecosystem. Effective urban planning emerges as a critical tool for addressing these challenges. Through the careful selection and implementation of targeted mitigation and adaptation strategies, it becomes possible to safeguard and enhance living conditions for urban populations. Such strategic planning is essential for ensuring that cities are not only habitable but also resilient and sustainable in the face of demographic shifts and environmental pressures.","Cichowicz, Robert","Bochenek, Anna Dominika",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,ANTHROPOCENE,Urban heat island,Air pollution,Health impact,Urban area,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2024,Assessing the effects of urban heat islands and air pollution on human quality of life

Images on social media that contain geographic information on the food market with research conditions are used as the data source, which is filtered by algorithms for the emotional value data. The filtered images are put into a machine learning model for training, resulting in a series of spatial images containing high emotional values, which are used as learning objects for the pictures entered by the user community at the input side of the system.

Nevertheless, there is a dearth of literature regarding the comprehensive policy -market mechanisms on the diffusion of plastic greenhouses. We combine the strength of spatial lag Tobit and BRT models to examine respective roles of policy and market as well as their intrinsic interactions in facilitating PMF growth. Our analysis reveals that both state promotion of food localization policies and spatial proximity to markets increase the intensity of PMF, and market -driven forces are confirmed to be the preponderant determinant. State investments in city -region vegetable production bases exert moderating effect on market-PMF linkages by alleviating market constraints on greenhouses adoption in remote farming regions, while direct policy effects show heterogeneity with different road accessibility, signaling a complex interplay in the interaction mechanism. The counterfactual simulation further emphasize a synergistic effect of policy -market confluence on PMF expansion, suggesting a robust combination of state interventions and market mechanisms.

However, existing models often overlook spatial heterogeneity and temporal dependencies when modeling LUCC at both the macro and microscales. In this paper, we propose a new model, a self-calibrated convolutional neural network-based cellular automata (SC-CNN-CA) model, which integrates macro- and microspatial characteristics to simulate complex interactions among land-use types. The SC-CNN-CA model incorporates a self-calibration module using Gaussian functions to capture macrotrend such as urban sprawl while accounting for microlevel land-use interactions such as neighborhood effects. The results indicated that (1) the neighborhood effect between agricultural land and urban land tended to ""increase followed by a decrease.""

Meanwhile, the conflicts and complex interaction characteristics of the EGI and CUI are discussed from both static and dynamic perspectives, and their driving mechanisms are investigated by combining specific indicators. The results demonstrate that over the past 20 years, LULC in Nanjing was dominated by cultivated land, forest land, and artificial surfaces. The encroachment of artificial surfaces on green space was strengthened, resulting in a decrease in the proportion of cultivated land from 70.09% in 2000 to 58.00% in 2020. The CUI increased at a change rate of 0.6%/year, while the EGI showed significant browning (change rate: -0.23%/year), mainly concentrated within the main urban boundaries. The relationship between the CUI and EGI made the leap from ""primary coordination"" to ""moderate coordination"", but there remains a risk of further deterioration of the decoupling relationship between the CUI and ecological pressures. The multi-year average contribution of the CUI to the EGI was 49.45%. Urbanization activities that dominate changes in greenness have changed over time, reflecting the timing of urban conflict management. The results provide important insights for urban ecological health monitoring and management.","Yang, Shengjie","Zhong, Liang","Zhou, Yunqiao","Sun, Bin","Wang, Rui","Sun, Zhengguo","Li, Jianlong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,REMOTE SENSING,spatial analysis,interaction driver,remote sensing index,greenness,coupling coordination degree,urbanization index,China,sustainability,,,,,,,,,JUL 2024,"Interactions and Conflicts between Urbanization and Greenness: A Case Study from Nanjing, China"

However, the potential capacity of urban forest carbon sequestration (CS) and its drivers remain unclear in urban agglomerations under rapid urbanization. In our study, the net primary productivity (NPP) of built-up areas was reconstructed in the Harbin-Changchun urban agglomeration (HCUA) from 2000 to 2020 to reflect urban forest CS, and the drivers of spatial urban forest CS patterns were further explored using the Geodetector model. Our results showed that the HCUA has experienced rapid urbanization over the past 20 years. Across the urbanization gradient, the CS capacity was higher in new developing built-up areas than in the old developed built-up areas for all years. The CS capacity of urban forests increased gradually from 2000 to 2020, especially in large built-up areas. The urban forest CS was skewed toward low (<100 g & sdot;m (- 2)) and medium value (100-300 g & sdot;m (- 2)) class distributions in all years; however, the proportion of high CS (>300 g & sdot;m (- 2)) show an overall increasing trend from 2000 to 2020, especially in small, low-altitude and old developed built-up areas. The total CS of built-up areas increased from 0.35 Mt & sdot;C & sdot;yr (- 1) in 2000 to 2.06 Mt & sdot;C & sdot;yr (- 1) in 2020, and the urban forests in the HCUA could offset approximately 2.23 % of urban carbon emissions in 2000, increasing to 5.08 % in 2020. Natural factors, such as temperature, mainly determined changes of the spatial urban forest CS distribution. In addition, we found that urban morphology factors, such as urban build-up area, construction height, population density, and gross national product, can significantly influence urban forest CS. We further found there may exist the threshold of urban built-up area and gross national product significantly affecting urban forest CS variation. The interaction between natural and anthropogenic factors had stronger explanatory power for the spatial variation of CS.

To integrate wind-thermal environment with urban design, we propose three scale levels, namely the district-superblock, superblock-block, and block-building levels, and divide the urban design elements into voids and solids. Thereafter, we establish a multiscale methodological framework in which the urban design contents are clarified by each scale, and the information transmitted between scales is obtained to ensure consistent value propositions and strategic approaches. The microclimate shaping of the urban open space is transformed into guiding strategies and quantitative indicators of the spatial form of the solid space.

However, the uncertainty of human mobility patterns and the complexity of urban transportation systems usually yield challenges in accurately estimating the travel flux within a city. Thus, we propose a novel travel flux estimation method that integrates traffic flow characteristics (traffic volume and travel time), spatio-temporal autocorrelation, and travel purpose correlation. First, the geographically weighted method was used to model and verify the spatio-temporal autocorrelation of origin-destination flows, whereas the purpose correlation of origin-destination flows was expressed through the function feature vectors of urban blocks. Then, a multi-objective bi-level programming model, according to the generalized least squares method, was constructed to estimate the travel flux between blocks. This was used to solve the problem of accurate estimation of travel flux by combining microscopic traffic flow characteristics with macroscopic spatio-temporal and purpose characteristics. Finally, an empirical analysis of the Hankou district, Wuhan City, demonstrated that in contrast to the existing method, the accuracy of the proposed method for predicting the human travel flux improved by approximately 20%. The estimated results were consistent with the spatial distribution pattern of human travel. Moreover, these results can provide targeted decision support for planning urban spaces, allocating urban resources, and guiding vehicular traffic.","Liu, Baoju","Tang, Zhongan","Deng, Min","Shi, Yan","He, Xiao","Huang, Bo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Travel flux estimation,Spatio-temporal autocorrelation,Purpose correlation,Integer programming,,,,,,,,,,,,,APR 2024,Estimation of travel flux between urban blocks by combining spatio-temporal and purpose correlation

What remains unclear is the impact of urban form and their interactions with seasonal changes. In this study, base on the air quality monitoring stations in the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration, the relationship between urban spatial indicators (building morphology and land use) and PM2.5 concentrations was investigated using full subset regression and variance partitioning analysis, and seasonal differences were further analysed. Our findings reveal that PM2.5 pollution exhibits different sensitivities to spatial scales, with higher sensitivity to the local microclimate formed by the three-dimensional structure of buildings at the local scale, while land use exerts greater influence at larger scales. Specifically, land use indicators contributed sustantially more to the PM2.5 prediction model as buffer zone expand (from an average of 2.41% at 100 m range to 47.30% at 5000 m range), whereas building morphology indicators display an inverse trend (from an average of 13.84% at 100 m range to 1.88% at 5000 m range). These results enderscore the importance of considering building morphology in local-scale urban planning, where the increasing building height can significantly enhance the disperion of PM2.5 pollution. Conversely, large-scale urban planning should prioritize the mixed use of green spaces and construction lands to mitigate PM2.5 pollution. Moreover, the significant seasonal differences in the ralationship between urban spatical indicatiors and PM2.5 pollution were observed. Particularly moteworthy is the heightened association between forest, water indicators and PM2.5 concentrations in summer, indicating the urban forests may facilitate the formation of volatile compunds, exacerbating the PM2.5 pollution.

Row_127,"Due to rapid urbanization and globalization, urban functions are increasingly segregated in cities comprising centers of population aggregation and economic activity. Urban development yields intertwining and interdependent functional areas for residence, commerce, and education, which leads to complex but regular population mobility patterns. Population mobility spaces can effectively represent the actual service scopes of urban functions. Therefore, in this study, we propose a function-associated population mobility network (FPMN) to dynamically delineate the service capacities of urban functions, and to quantify the driving effects of urban functions on population mobility under spatial interaction conditions. By integrating the cumulative opportunities of geographic nodes with the potential opportunities reflected by population mobility, k-step function accessibility with population mobility (k-step PFA) is defined in FPMN to characterize the accessibility relationships between geographic nodes and function nodes. Based on k-step PFA, considering the complementarity and intervention opportunities, the function-driven index (FDI) is proposed to quantify the driving effects of urban functions on population mobility. Our experimental results indicated that FPMN could effectively represent the actual service scopes and capabilities of urban functions. Compared with general location-based accessibility indicators, k-step PFA has a higher numerical distribution and less spatial disparity, and it aligns more closely with the actual service scopes of urban functions. In addition, compared with intervening opportunities models, FDI delineates the functional driving effects of population mobility with greater precision, as well as revealing the travel propensity traits of a population relative to various urban functions through propensity parameters.","Liu, Xinrui","Li, Rui","Cai, Jing","Li, Bosen","Li, Yanhao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION,Urban function,Population mobility network,Accessibility,Transferability,Complementarity,Intervention opportunities,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,Quantifying urban function accessibility and its effect on population mobility based on function-associated population mobility network

For each individual, we defined optimal pharmacy access as having a driving distance <= 2 miles to the closest pharmacy in urban counties, <= 5 miles in suburban counties, and <= 10 miles in rural counties. We used a logistic regression model to measure the association between race/ethnicity and pharmacy access, while controlling for racial/ethnic composition of the census tract, area deprivation index, income, age, gender, and U.S. region. The model included an interaction between race/ethnicity and urbanicity to evaluate whether racial/ethnic inequities differed across the rural-urban continuum. Results: The sample included 90,749,446 individuals of whom 80.6% had optimal pharmacy access. Racial/ethnic inequities in pharmacy access differed across the rural-urban continuum (P value for interaction= <0.0001). In rural areas, Black (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.86-0.87), Hispanic (OR 0.80; 95% CI 0.79-0.80), and indigenous (OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.47-0.48) individuals had lower odds of optimal pharmacy access, than White individuals. Hispanic (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.96-0.97) and Indigenous individuals (OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.75-0.76) had lower odds of optimal pharmacy access compared to White individuals in suburban areas. In Western states, Asian had lower odds of optimal pharmacy access in suburban (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.86-0.90) and rural areas (OR 0.91; 95% CI 0.87-0.95) compared to White individuals. Conclusions: Racial/ethnic inequities in spatial access to community pharmacies vary between urban and rural communities. Underrepresented racial/ethnic groups have significantly lower pharmacy access in rural and some suburban areas, but not in urban areas.","Appolon, Giovanni","Tang, Shangbin","Gabriel, Nico","Morales, Jasmine","Berenbrok, Lucas A.","Lacroix, Andrea Z.","Guo, Jingchuan","Mathis, Walter S.","Hernandez, Inmaculada",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL-AUG 2024,Racial and ethnic inequities in spatial access to pharmacies: A geographic information system analysis
Row_129,"The diversified innovative strategies adopted by the new retail format in urban spaces have significantly driven retail transformation and innovation. The combination of online platforms and physical stores provides a substantial advantage in market competition. This paper takes ""Freshippo"", a typical representative of China's new retail, as an example. Based on multi-source data and using tools such as GIS spatial analysis, statistical analysis, and geographical detectors, this study comprehensively examines the spatial clustering characteristics and influencing factors of Freshippo physical stores in Shanghai. The findings show that Freshippo has significantly expanded in the Shanghai fresh food market by innovatively opening various types of stores. However, there are substantial differences in the proportions of different types of stores, with 94% of the stores having online retail capabilities. Each offline store in the new retail format presents a multi-level ""complementary"" spatial distribution feature across the urban space, with distinctive clusters in the urban central districts, urban periphery areas, and outer suburban districts. The radiation range of logistics and distribution services exhibits characteristics of ""central agglomeration and multi-point distribution"", providing residents with diverse and accurate services. Additionally, the comparison of multiple model results shows that the location selection of various types of new retail stores is significantly influenced by multiple factors, especially the nonlinear amplification effect of factor interactions on store agglomeration. These findings provide an important scientific reference for understanding the development of new retail formats and offer new ideas that promote the transformation and innovation of the retail industry, thereby achieving sustainable development.","Zhang, Ershen","Zhou, Yajuan","Chen, Guojun","Wang, Guoen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,SUSTAINABILITY,new retail stores,spatial clustering,sustainable retail,platform economy,complementary,Freshippo,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 2024,Classified Spatial Clustering and Influencing Factors of New Retail Stores: A Case Study of Freshippo in Shanghai
Row_130,"The unchecked growth of urban populations has spurred rapid and unsustainable urban expansion, exacerbating environmental degradation both locally and globally. This research offers a comprehensive analysis of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon in Bangalore and Hyderabad, India, focusing on its spatial and temporal distribution and its correlation with air pollutants. Conducted over the course of summer and winter seasons from 2001 to 2021, this study advances our understanding of UHI dynamics in rapidly urbanizing regions, shedding light on the complex interplay between urbanization, climate, and air quality. The primary objective of this study is to assess and compare the predictive performance of baseline Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models for forecasting Land Surface Temperature (LST) in Hyderabad, India, while examining the impact of integrating spatial information into these models. Incorporating an extensive array of input variables, ranging from spectral indices to terrain features, land use/land cover (LULC) data, atmospheric parameters, and spatial data, the analysis reveals significant relationships between LST and various factors. Notably, Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) exhibit strong positive correlations with LST, while Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) demonstrates a pronounced negative correlation. Similarly, Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) displays the strongest positive correlation with LST (r = 0.49), whereas EVI exhibits the most notable negative correlation (r = -0.67). Additionally, Modified Bare Soil Index (MBI) demonstrates a noteworthy negative correlation (r = -0.48) with LST for Bangalore. Atmospheric components such as CO, NO2, and O-3 also show significant positive correlations with LST, with NO2 displaying the highest correlation during winter in urban areas. XGBoost emerges as the superior model, achieving high R-2 values of 0.84 for Bangalore and 0.88 for Hyderabad. Integration of spatial information consistently enhances the performance of both RF and XGBoost models, resulting in reduced Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values. However, predictions over water bodies tend to be underestimated. The study underscores the importance of incorporating spatial data for accurate LST prediction, with implications for environmental monitoring and management. Despite the advancements made, further research is needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms through which spatial information improves model performance, suggesting avenues for future investigation and refinement of modeling methodologies. At the intersection of rapid urban growth and environmental conservation, these findings are poised to inform policymakers, urban planners, and researchers, guiding them towards innovative and sustainable urban development strategies aimed at mitigating the adverse impacts of rapid urban expansion while promoting ecosystem well-being. The study contributes to spatial modeling strategies and refines LST prediction methodologies, offering valuable insights for addressing the challenges posed by urbanization and climate change in rapidly urbanizing regions.","Mathew, Aneesh","Arunab, K.

Row_131,"Innovation is an intrinsic driver of high -quality urban development, and construction land expansion (CLE) is an important challenge that cities must address to achieve sustainable development; however, the existing literature mainly examines urban innovation and CLE from a static perspective. The extant research lacks an in-depth analysis of the relationship and impact between urban innovation network linkage intensity (UINLI) and CLE from the perspective of intercity interaction. This study establishes a new mechanistic framework for the impact of UINLI on CLE from the network linkage perspective based on panel data of 10 national -level urban agglomerations in China from 2007 to 2019. Using a modified gravity model and a spatial econometric model, we empirically estimate the impact of UINLI on CLE for different regions and structures. The results show that (1) UINLI in each urban agglomeration is increasing, gradually forming a ""multinode, multiaxis, gradient"" network connection characteristics. (2) UINLI has a significant inhibitory effect on CLE; the largest inhibiting effect is on the residential land, followed by the commercial land, and less on the industrial land. (3) The inhibiting effect of UINLI on CLE in the eastern, central, and western urban agglomerations gradually increases from east to west. (4) The negative effect of UINLI on CLE in network -style, group -style, and point -axis -style urban agglomerations decreases with the increasing tightness of the innovation network structure.","Shi, Haimeng","Li, Qiao","Zhang, Sun","Chen, Wei",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS,Urban agglomeration,Innovation network linkage intensity,Construction land expansion,Modified gravity model,Spatial econometric model,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 1 2024,How does urban innovation affect construction land use change in China?

Row_132,"Park green space is a big part of public infrastructure in cities, and how to evaluate and optimize the mismatch of urban park green space (UPGS) has become the focus of current research in academia and industry. Taking China's 286 cities as an example, this paper used the spatial cluster and Boston Consulting Group Matrix to analyze the aggregation laws and changing modes of UPGS from 2010 to 2020, introduced the spatial mismatch model to analyze the matching of its supply and demand with GDP and population, and adopted the Geodetector to analyze the influencing factors. The findings: (1) The evolution of UPGS in China had long been characterized by a ""pyramidal"" pattern, i.e., limited green cities > developing green cities > steady green cities > booming green cities, exhibiting the spatial characteristics of gradient differences between the coasts and inland areas, and the aggregation of blocks in some areas. (2) The supply and demand mismatches of the UPGS were relatively stable, with negative matching being the main supply mismatch type, and positive matching being the main demand mismatch type. The contribution of supply and demand mismatches similarly showed a spatial pattern of a gradual decrease from the coast to inland and the aggregation of blocks in some areas. (3) Five types of factors played different driving roles on UPGS, with social development remaining a weak factor, and the strong factor switching from urban infrastructure to construction land scale. The interaction detection was dominated by a bilinear enhancement, with super-interaction factors changing from an output value of the tertiary industry and population urbanization rate to education expenditure in local general public budgets. (4) Based on the mismatch between the supply and demand for UPGS in China, 286 cities were classified into four types, namely a smart shrinking zone, smart growing zone, status quo zone, and overlay policy zone, and differentiated development proposals for the corresponding zoning were put forward. This paper constructed an application framework of ""evolution pattern + supply demand match + driving factors + policy zoning"" for UPGS at a large scale, which will effectively enhance the effective allocation of its resources across the country.","Zhao, Kaixu","Chen, Chao","Wang, Jianming","Liu, Kaixi","Wu, Fengqi","Cao, Xiaoteng",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,FORESTS,urban park green space,spatio-temporal characteristics,supply-demand relationship,spatial mismatch model,driving mechanism,China,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2024,"Examining the Spatial Mode, Supply-Demand Relationship, and Driving Mechanism of Urban Park Green Space: A Case Study from China"

In this study, we examine how cross-regional ecological and social interactions affect synergistic effects. Using InVEST and correlation analysis with data from 2010 through 2020, we assessed ESs (i. e., water retention-WR, nutrient retention-NR, and carbon storage-CS) in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region. A small watershed, a river network, and settlement development capacity are used to delineate ecological and social interactions units. Based on a Bayesian network model that considers population, economy, and spatial agglomeration patterns between social units, we assessed the potential for achieving a synergistic improvement of ESs and the driving forces behind them. The results show that ESs in the BTH region compete, only a small percentage (6.38%) shows synergetic improvement across CS, WR, and NR. It is beneficial for upstream watersheds to retain water and nutrients, but to maintain carbon storage they may sacrifice water retention. Upstream areas with less development and higher vegetation density have better ecosystem integrity of up- and down-stream watersheds, and can be enhanced with minimal human impact, as social interactions and settlement spatial structures influence ES synergies. There is a higher risk for ecological issues in downstream areas, but greater awareness and collaboration can lead to better ES synergies.","Han, Ze","Deng, Xiangzheng",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,Social -ecological system,Ecosystem service,Trade-off,Synergy,Urban - rural symbiosis unit,Beijing-tianjin-hebei region,,,,,,,,,,,APR 2024,The impact of cross-regional social and ecological interactions on ecosystem service synergies

Objective assessments of UGSs are necessary for optimizing the allocation of green space public resources and providing a basis for social equality.

Row_135,"The purpose of the work is to identify a special subject area in the research of symbolic capital of cities - symbolic geopolitical capital - and to identify its connection with urban space. The author defines environmental symbolic resources - urban signs or symbol carriers - the category of symbolic geopolitical capital (SGC), reveals their structure based on the applied example of St. Petersburg, as well as the principles of interaction with the urban environment and some ways in which SGK in symbolic politics are determined. The material carriers of symbols have at least four special properties that give the actors of urban symbolic politics an advantage when using these carriers in a competitive struggle: the duration of their existence and anchoring in the fabric of the city; the power of nomination - ideas about their legitimacy and public recognition; they are more likely to be encoded by the consciousness of the citizen in the form of a priori ""normal"", ""comfortable"" and positive perception; and they provide the actors of symbolic politics with special means of political maneuver, using the principle of separation and variability of interpretations of such signs. In addition to the principles of placement described for each category of signs, their generalized types are highlighted: spatial concentration, spatial confinement, spatial hierarchy and effective spatial representation. The means of symbolic management using SGC are described, such as: all kinds of physical actions with the carriers themselves; activism correlated with them; producing new political meanings of their nominations and renominations; reinterpretation of existing and production of new symbols and associated signs, thereby - the production of new symbolic resources and the reconfiguration of the symbolic space of the city. Examples are given of urban conflicts related to geopolitical urban signs reflected in public discourse. They are grouped by potential sources of conflictogenicity due to the different attitudes of actors to: practices and manifestations of territorial strategies, their results and consequences; concepts and proposed worldviews; ideas about control over territory. A number of principles and patterns for the formation and use of symbolic geopolitical capital associated with urban space in politics are formulated: specialization in the nomination, the ""latent"" nature of the potential for conflict inherent in the SGC, the change of hierarchies, stages or ""waves"" of geopolitical symbolic policy in urban space, the formation of a ""geopolitical symbolic footprint"".","Axenov, K.

Row_136,"Air pollution and Land Surface Temperature (LST) are crucial components of urban environments. As urbanization and industrialization increase, the two components affect the natural environment of the urban areas. The present study investigated the daytime and nighttime spatiotemporal distribution of air pollutants and examined their relationship with LST for Bengaluru and Hyderabad cities of India. Daytime/nighttime/seasonal/spatial variations of air pollutants and LST, sensitivity of air pollutant in affecting LST, relationship between air pollutants and LST, and hotspots/coldspots analysis for LST and air pollutants was carried out. The study utilized, air pollutants data of 5-years from air quality monitoring stations and LST data of overlapping period from MODIS satellite. PM 2.5 exceeded the national and international air quality standards while all other parameters were within specified limits/guideline values, at both the cities. The study found that LST had maximum sensitivity towards PM 2.5 and NO 2 for both the cities indicating that both these parameters are more effective in causing changes in the LST values. High Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI) values for urban areas demonstrated strong surface urban heat island (SUHI) during nighttime in both the cities. Pearson's correlation analysis showed that LST, at Hyderabad, was positively correlated with PM 2.5 (r = 0.714) during daytime. Relationship of LST with all air pollutants and meteorological parameters was investigated simultaneously and very strong relationship of LST with all other parameters was observed for both daytime and nighttime for both the cities. The R 2 values at Bengaluru were 0.98 and 0.92 for nighttime and daytime, respectively, while the corresponding values were 0.87 and 0.93, respectively for Hyderabad. Hotspot analysis showed that total area of hotspots/coldspots undergoes temporal variations and the corresponding area during daytime was higher/lower compared to nighttime for different parameters. The trend of increase/decrease of daytime area of hotspots/ coldspots, over nighttime area, was also different from different parameters as well as it was observed different for both the cities. Overall, the present study provides holistic insights into the interaction between air pollutants and LST in urban contexts. By understating these interactions and variations it helps urban planning and policymaking mitigate the challenge of the rise in LST and air pollutants.","Suthar, Gourav","Singh, Saurabh","Kaul, Nivedita","Khandelwal, Sumit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT,Air pollutant,Land surface temperature,Spatial autocorrelation,Hotspot,Urban heat island,MODIS,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 2024,Diurnal variation of air pollutants and their relationship with land surface temperature in Bengaluru and Hyderabad cities of India

Greening children's home-school routes can be seen as an environmentally sustainable solution that enhances their daily interaction with nature. However, the uneven distribution of greenery and route networks within cities results in varied opportunities for pedestrians, including children, to experience greenery. This study evaluates the urban heterogeneity of trade-offs between exposure to greenery and route length. We focus on the shortest and greenest hypothetical home-school routes for all children in the city. For this purpose, we conducted a spatial analysis using multiple spatially explicit data sets on primary schoolchildren, pedestrian street networks, and high-resolution urban green space maps, with & Lstrok;odz (Poland) as the case study city. Children who opt for the greenest hypothetical routes instead of the shortest could increase their exposure to greenery by 18%. However, maximizing exposure to greenery requires choosing routes 9.5% (46 m) longer than the shortest alternative. The trade-off between the shortest and greenest home-school routes is more pronounced for children in the urban core area compared to other city zones. This urban heterogeneity should be considered when allocating new greenery to support active transportation.","Khanian, Mojtaba","Laszkiewicz, Edyta","Kronenberg, Jakub","Sikorska, Daria",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,APPLIED GEOGRAPHY,Sustainable mobility,Walkability,Urban green spaces,Spatial data analysis,Child-friendly cities,Costs and benefits,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,Urban heterogeneity of the trade-offs between exposure to greenery and walking distance in children's home-school routes
Row_138,"Understanding and forecasting the spatial and temporal distributions of extreme precipitation over urban areas is crucial for effective planning and mitigation efforts. However, this task remains challenging as accurate forecasting depends on properly representing urban surfacees and their interactions with the planetary boundary layer (PBL). We examined the hindcast of an extreme precipitation event over Beijing on 21-22 July 2012. The primary focus was assessing its sensitivity to two widely used PBL parameterizations (MYJ and YSU), two urban parameterizations (SLUCM and BEP_BEM), and two different land-use and land-cover (LULC) datasets. Sensitivity experiments were initialized at different times to explore the model dependence on initial conditions. The analyses were conducted over three selected regions: the entire model domain covering the Beijing metropolitan area, an upwind region of Beijing, and the entire urban area of Beijing. The results show that the MYJ PBL scheme performs better than the YSU PBL scheme in capturing near-surface air temperature as well as the location and timing of the heaviest precipitation. The variability in simulated precipitation among the chosen PBL schemes is lower compared to that among different time of initializations. The LULC impacted the spatial distribution of precipitation but its effect on the amount of precipitation was minimal. Overall, using a combination of the MYJ PBL scheme, SLUCM urban parameterization, and locally-enhanced Beijing LULC, and initializing the model simulations at 0000 UTC July 20, 2012, demonstrated superior performance in capturing precipitation levels, despite some spatial discrepancies in the precipitation distribution. The performance of BEP_BEM urban parameterization is similar to SLUCM across various factors such as average rain rate, maximum rain rate, and rain volume. These findings offer valuable insights towards better simulations of extreme precipitation and flooding in rapidly urbanizing areas such as Beijing.","Tewari, Mukul","Zhou, Xin","Ray, Pallav","Treinish, Lloyd","Dudhia, Jimy","Chen, Fei",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH,Extreme rainfall,Initial and boundary conditions,PBL schemes,Urban parameterizations,SLUCM,BEP_BEM,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 1 2024,Model sensitivity in predicting extreme precipitation events in urban areas: A case study over Beijing
Row_139,"Understanding how people choose routes in urban environments is essential for effective urban planning. While conventional transportation studies focus on utilitarian decision-making, this research investigates the complex interplay between human-environment interactions and emotional attachments to places, which influence transportation choices. Specifically, we examine the impact of sense of place in pedestrian route choice within a densely populated urban university community. Unlike typical urban settings characterized by clear roads and landmarks, university environments often feature intricate layouts with diffuse pathways, shared spaces, and a lack of clear spatial hierarchies. This complexity challenges conventional spatial knowledge acquisition methods. Individuals navigating such environments tend to rely on socio-sensory wayfinding strategies, developing emotional connections to specific places and routes over time. Consequently, route choices in these contexts may not always be deliberate but rather subconscious and nuanced. Our study focuses on elucidating the impact of the sense of place-a composite of conscious and subconscious perceptions, emotions, and attachments to a location-on daily route decisions. Through structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis, we demonstrate that the sense of place significantly influences route choices within community building complexes, surpassing utilitarian considerations as a primary explanatory factor. These findings underscore the importance of emotional and psychological factors in shaping urban route decisions, offering valuable insights for urban planning and management strategies.","Chan, Ho-Yin","Cheng, Dawei","Chen, Anthony",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Pedestrian route choice,Sense of place,Place identity,Place attachment,University community,Mobility practices,Structural equation modeling,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2024,Routes with roots: Pedestrian route choices and sense of place of an urban university community

Preferable futures portray harmonious interactions between nature and humans, recognizing nature's intrinsic and relational values, as well as acknowledging its agency in the context of urban planning. Additionally, the evolving role of technology in shaping these desirable futures is a growing area of exploration, potentially challenging established definitions of nature and paving the way for the construction of new natures in prospective scenarios. Another facet of exploration is the spatial dimension of human-nature relationships. Articles investigate various contexts where these relationships may unfold, spanning from within cities to envisioning revised approaches at the urban-rural interface for a radical transformation of our connection to the natural world, including the consideration of distinct entities, such as mountains or non-urban territories, as potential focal points for evolving human-nature relationships. The special issue helps deepen our understanding of the intricate interplay between humans and nature in urban planning, exploring diverse visions of the future and the spatial dynamics where these relationships may manifest.

Interactions (i.e., trade-offs, synergies, and irrelevance) generally exist among ESs, however, few studies have been done on the methodology for simulating urban growth that optimizes the synergistic effect of ESs. In this study, the Wuhan metropolitan area was taken as the research area. Four key ESs in 2000, 2010, and 2020: water yield (WY), carbon storage (CS), habitat quality (HQ), and soil retention (SR) were evaluated by using the InVEST model. Then the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) method was applied to optimally allocate ESs trade-offs and identify ecological priority protection areas (EPPAs). Finally, the PLUS model was used to simulate urban growth scenarios under different levels of ESs protection constraints and propose spatial planning strategies. The results revealed the following. (1) From 2000 to 2020, the three ESs (i.e., WY, CS, and HQ) exhibited the spatial distribution pattern with high in the east and low in the west, and higher in the woodland than in built-up areas, except SR, which remained at a weak level throughout the region. (2) During the 20 years, SR and the other three ESs, HQ and CS showed a synergistic relationship; WY exhibited a very weak trade-off with HQ; and WY and CS changed from a very weak trade-off to a weak synergy.

The results were as follows: (1) the spatial distribution of the 2010 and 2020 Guanzhong Plain urban agglomeration ecology-human-resource security index was imbalanced and the surrounding area is safer than the central area. (2) in 2010, the number of two kind effective management modes was enhanced significantly and the number of two kind overexploited management modes was suppressed significantly, compared to 1000 random networks. (3) in 2020, the number of two kind effective management modes was enhanced significantly and the number of one kind overexploited management mode was suppressed significantly, compared to 1000 random networks. These results suggest a highly interconnected management structural feature with suppressed overexploited management mode through conceptualizing complex modes of socialecological network. The management and utilization of resources need to take into account the ecological relationship between peri-urban forests and the common agreement between managers in network.","Wang, Guoyu","Li, Jing","Liu, Xianfeng","Li, Boyan","Zhang, Ya",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,LAND USE POLICY,Peri-urban forest,Urban built-up area,Social -ecological network,Multilevel network,Exponential random graph models,Guanzhong Plain urban agglomeration,,,,,,,,,,,APR 2024,"Social-ecological network of peri-urban forest in urban expansion: A case study of urban agglomeration in Guanzhong Plain, China"
Row_146,"The Coronavirus pandemic has presented multifaceted challenges in urban emotional well-being and mental health management. Our study presents a spatio-temporal sentiment mining (STSM) framework to address these challenges, focusing on the space-time geography and environmental psychology. This framework analyzes the distribution and trends of 6 categories of public sentiments in Shanghai during the COVID-19 crisis, considering the potential urban spatial influencing factors. The research specifically draws on social media data temporally coinciding with the spread of COVID-19 and the pre-trained language model RoBERTa-wwm-ext to classify public sentiment, in order to characterize the distribution and trends of dominant urban sentiment under the influence of epidemic at different phases. The interactions between urban geospatial features and sentiments are further modelled and explained using LightGBM algorithm and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) technique. The experimental findings reveal the subtle yet dynamic impact of the urban environment on the longterm spatial variation and trends of public sentiment under the epidemic, with green spaces and socioeconomic status emerging as significant factors. Regions with higher permanent population consumption demonstrated more positive sentiments, underscoring the significance of socio-economic factors in urban planning and public health policy. This research offers the most extensive analysis to date on the influence of urban characteristics on public sentiment during Shanghai's epidemic life cycle also lays the groundwork for applying the STSM framework in future crises beyond COVID-19.","Wang, Siqi","Liang, Chao","Gao, Yunfan","Ye, Yu","Qiu, Jingyu","Tao, Chuang","Wang, Haofen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,HEALTH & PLACE,Crisis life cycle,Artificial intelligence,Deep learning,Pre -trained language model,Emotion classification,Sentiment analysis,Social media,Urban environment,Urban computing,Explainable AI,,,,,,,JAN 2024,Social media insights into spatio-temporal emotional responses to COVID-19 crisis

However, current research on domestic digital projection predominantly revolves around technical aspects, resulting in relatively uniformity in content and visual representation. Therefore, against this backdrop, this study innovatively introduces theatrical arts into the projection mapping of old urban community building facades to achieve deep interaction between dramatic content and community environments. Using the example of the digital projection artwork ""The Magic Flute"" at the Chongqing International Light and Shadow Art Festival in the Huangjueping community, the study primarily analyzes spatial forms, visual characteristics, digital interactions, and related interviews. This research contends that ""The Magic Flute"" transcends the realm of digital technology by establishing a unique binary structure of ""landscape-drama"" that deeply integrates landscape forms with dramatic content in the community, enriching the cultural content and narrative structure of digital projection works in old urban areas. Additionally, it proposes experimental methods led by theatrical arts, creates more delicate immersive experiences in community theaters, and uncovers the media art creation process closely aligned with the reality of old urban areas, thereby offering valuable insights to support the sustainable revitalization of old urban communities in China.","Chen, Xingyu","Liu, Xiang","Zhou, Hongtao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,"HCI INTERNATIONAL 2024 POSTERS, PT III, HCII 2024",,Old Urban Communities,Digital Projection Art,The Magic Flute,Landscape-Drama,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024,"Landscape-Drama"": Innovative Applications of Digital Projection Art in the Renewal of Chinese Old City Communities"

Row_149,"Streets, vital for vehicular and pedestrian traffic, are increasingly repurposed to enhance urban vibrancy beyond transport needs. This paper explores intentional and spontaneous street experiments, drawing on Henri Lefebvre's rhythmanalysis. Streets are seen as hosts to intersecting rhythms shaped by daily routines and mobility, with users as performers in rhythmic interactions. While initially disruptive, these experiments strive to integrate innovative elements for cohesive urban compositions. Through a musical metaphor, the paper promotes a holistic approach to identifying rhythms influenced and introduced by street experiments. It examines how these rhythms interact, presenting as synchronised dynamics, disruptive discordance, or coexistence in dissonant compositions. Combining rhythmanalysis with spatial discourse analysis, the study 'reads' and 'listens' to temporary spaces through historical records (N = 55) of seven street experiments in Hong Kong from 2016 to 2020. Findings uncover the overly abstract agendas of these experiments - exemplified through narratives involving chairs, railings, and traffic signals - often oversimplify and exclude possibilities. The paper calls for open dialogue to capture power dynamics in street infrastructure and embodied lived experiences during the transition from vehicle-centred to people-oriented streets. It suggests rhythmanalysis as an initial tool for urban planners to envision streetscapes as symphonies, fostering sensitivity to time-space dynamics.","Chan, Tommy H.

Row_150,"Fine particulate matter such as PM2.5 threatens significantly to the environment and human health, so it is essential to design a reliable long-term prediction method for PM2.5 concentrations. Existing long-term PM2.5 prediction models inadequately utilize urban spatial features, fail to consider the role of meteorological factors in PM2.5 levels, and overlook the interaction between PM2.5 concentrations in different cities. To tackle this issue, we propose two new models and integrate them. Firstly, we develop a spatial feature model (ECGAT) for extracting PM2.5 concentration among regions based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN), edge-channel mechanisms, and Graph Attention Convolution (GATConv). This model utilizes GNN to extract urban adjacency relationships and meteorological features, employs edge-channel mechanisms to recalculate weights for interactions between cities, and outputs spatial correlations through GATConv. Secondly, we propose Gating Closed-form Continuous-time Neural Networks (GCFC) as a temporal model to extract the PM2.5 concentration's temporal features. The fusion of these two models, named ECGAT-GCFC (EGCFC), enhances the model's capability to capture spatiotemporal features and improves performance in PM2.5 long-term predictions. Results from real-world data analysis show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art existing prediction models in predicting PM2.5 levels over long durations. Compared to baseline models, EGCFC reduces RMSE by an average of 3.39 %, decreases MAE by 4.83 %, increases R2 by 4.89 %, CSI by 3.13 %, and lowers FAR by 11.39 %. These indicate that EGCFC is an effective method for predicting trends in urban PM2.5 concentrations.","Zhang, Chen","Li, Xiaofan","Sheng, Hongyang","Shen, Ya","Xie, Wei","Zhu, Xuhui",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION,PM2.5 prediction,Air pollution,Graph neural network,Gating Closed-form continuous-time neural,networks,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2024,Long-term prediction method for PM2.5 concentration using edge channel graph attention network and gating closed-form continuous-time neural networks
Row_151,"Green infrastructure (GI), as one type of ecological stormwater management practices, can potentially alleviate water problems and deliver a wide range of environmental benefits in urban areas. GIs are often planned and designed to reduce runoff and mitigate pollution. However, the influence of GI on groundwater hydrology and that of shallow groundwater on GI performance was seldom considered. This study utilized a calibrated surfacesubsurface hydrological model, i.e., Storm Water Management Model coupled with USGS 's modular hydrologic model (SWMM-MODFLOW) to consider the interaction between GI and groundwater into the process of GI planning. The optimal implementation ratio, aggregation level and upstream-downstream location of bioretention cells (BC, one type of GI) under different planning objectives and hydrogeologic conditions was explored. The consideration of groundwater management exerted a significant impact on the optimal spatial allocation of BCs. The results showed that when groundwater management was more concerned than runoff control, BCs were recommended to be allocated more apart from each other and more upstream in the catchment because more-distributed and upstream BCs can result in lower groundwater table rise which is beneficial. BCs were overall recommended to be allocated in areas of deeper groundwater tables, coarser soils, and flatter topographies. However, the spatial features of BCs are related to each other, the choice of them are affected by various hydrogeologic factors simultaneously. The exact location of BCs should be determined by considering the trade-off between runoff control efficiency and groundwater impact. The findings obtained in this study can provide guidance on GI planning in shallow groundwater areas.","Zhang, K","Chui, TFM",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 20 2024,Spatial allocation of bioretention cells considering interaction with shallow groundwater: A simulation-optimization approach

Quantitative EE analysis is a crucial evaluation criterion for measuring the process of sustainable development (SD). To assess the current state of sustainable development in China, this study employs the slacks-based super efficiency model (Super-SBM) to measure the the urban eco-efficiency in China (CUEE) of 284 cities. The study utilizes Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and Spatial Autocorrelation Analysis (SAA) to investigate the fundamental patterns of CUEE in terms of inter-city differences and relationships. Complex Network Analysis (CNA) and Link Prediction methods are applied to examine the characteristics and future trends of the CUEE network. Additionally, Geodetector and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) are used to analyze the influencing factors of CUEE. The findings are as follows: Overall CUEE is relatively low but shows a steady increase. The spatial association network of CUEE is becoming more complex, with increasing association strengths. The Chengdu-Chongqing Economic Circle (CCEC) is expected to further enhance its spatial association strength and may emerge as a new core area. The effectiveness of the interactions among selected factors is greater than that of individual factors.

It is of great significance to evaluate the sustainable development level and explore the interactions among sustainable development goals (SDGs) for the promotion of sustainability. In present study, a localized urban sustainable development evaluation framework was first proposed. Then, taking Shandong Province as an example, the spatiotemporal variations and goal evenness of sustainability were investigated. Finally, synergies and trade-offs between SDGs were revealed. The results showed that the sustainable development level has improved slightly from 2011 to 2020 in Shandong Province, exhibiting a dual-core pattern with Jinan and Qingdao. Shandong Province performed relatively well in SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). The unevenness existed in sustainable development, indicating that the development process varied from one goal to another and there were obvious differences among cities for the same goal.

Row_154,"Transit-oriented development (TOD) represents a pivotal strategy globally aimed at promoting urban and transportation sustainability. A vital challenge to the effectiveness of TOD is the spatial discordance between urban transit and land development. Despite a recent surge of interest in the relationship of rail transit and land use, the conclusions are predominantly confined to the metro station area. The key land-use characteristics pivotal to gaging the sustainability of TOD, such as the proportion of commercial land and the ratio of green spaces, remain insufficiently scrutinized. Therefore, this study evaluates if and how rail transit development has integrated land use citywide, with a particular focus on green spaces, commercial value, land-use diversity, and job-housing spaces. We developed a citywide grid-scale index of rail transit accessibility (CRTA) and constructed coordination models based on multidimensional spatial data and bivariate spatial autocorrelation analysis. The results imply the following: 1) Residence, employment, and the diversity of functional facilities, influenced by market and individual preference exhibit a robust spatial coordination with CRTA. But government-led planned commercial land demonstrates a poor coordination with CRTA, and there is a pronounced incoordination between planned green spaces and CRTA. 2) There are significant disparities in the interactive relationships between CRTA and various land-use characteristics across urban and suburban settings. In urban areas, there is a high level of coordinated development between rail transit networks and land use, although this is influenced by physical segmentation and planning policies. In suburban areas, rail transit plays a guiding role in land development, but the development of rail transit fails to keep up with that of land use. Finally, the study provides recommendations for coordinating rail transit with land-use characteristics in both urban and suburban areas, and identifies key areas where improvements in rail transit accessibility are most urgently required.","Cong, Wen","Zhou, Junhong","Lai, Yani",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY,Transit oriented development,TOD assessment,Rail transit and land use,Coordination,Interaction type,Shenzhen,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 15 2024,"The coordination between citywide rail transit accessibility and land-use characteristics in Shenzhen, China: An explorative analysis based on multidimensional spatial data"
Row_155,"Groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) interactions are complex phenomena that vary naturally over space and time and are being influenced by environmental change. The Whitson River watershed is a mixed land-use Precambrian shield watershed located in Northeastern Ontario, Canada in which groundwater is a source of municipal water supply and in which groundwater and surface waters are at risk of potential impacts from urban runoff, ongoing municipal drainage projects, periodic flooding, and climate change. This study used watershed-scale synoptic surveys of stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta H-2) and geochemistry, and corresponding mixing-model approaches (two-component and three-component) to quantify the seasonal and spatial variation in surface water, ambient, and urban groundwater contributions to streamflow. Multiple mixing models were generated based on isotope and geochemical source water identification, and the performance of these models was compared. Mixing-model analyses showed that groundwater contributes a critical, sustaining source to streamflow (> 50 % or more) during summer baseflow conditions, dropping to similar to 15 % in fall when connection to shield lakes and wetlands dominate. Three-component mixing models showed similar results to the two-component models, refining groundwater contributions into ambient and urban groundwater sources. Estimated urban groundwater contributed 30 % or more to summer baseflow, dropping to similar to 4 % in the fall. Baseflow estimates derived from graphical hydrograph separation were similar to mixing model groundwater estimates in the summer but suggest this approach overestimates groundwater contributions during the fall. These results demonstrate the complexity of source water contributions to streamflow and the challenges in their determination in mixed-land-use Precambrian Shield landscapes where communities are largely located. Assessment of source water contributions to streamflow across the Whitson River sub-watershed has generated a region-specific conceptualization (e.g. urban versus ambient groundwater) of a basin that is experiencing increased urban development, providing information that will be of value for long term management.","Montgomery, Kimberly","James, April L.","Macrae, Merrin","Tafvizi, Arghavan","Snider, Rebecca","Goel, Pradeep","Zhang, Helen","Yao, Huaxia","Wachowiak, Mark",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Groundwater-surface water interactions,Hydrograph separation,Tracer-based mixing model,Isotope hydrology,Tracer,Chloride,Mixed land-use,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2024,Constraining seasonal and spatial ambient and urban groundwater contributions to streamflow across a mixed land-use regional-scale Precambrian Shield watershed

Row_160,"For next-generation weather and climate numerical models to resolve cities, both higher spatial resolution and subgrid parameterizations of urban canopy-atmosphere processes are required. The key is to better understand intraurban variability and urban-rural differences in atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) dynamics. This includes upwind-downwind effects due to cities' influences on the atmosphere beyond their boundaries. To address these aspects, a network of >25 ground-based remote sensing sites was designed for the Berlin region (Germany), considering city form, function, and typical weather conditions. This allows investigation of how different urban densities and human activities impact ABL dynamics. As part of the interdisciplinary European Research Council Grant urbisphere, the network was operated from autumn 2021 to autumn 2022. Here, we provide an overview of the scientific aims, campaign setup, and results from 2 days, highlighting multiscale urban impacts on the atmosphere in combination with high-resolution numerical modeling at 100-m grid spacing. During a spring day, the analyses show systematic upwind-city-downwind effects in ABL heights, largely driven by urban-rural differences in surface heat fluxes. During a heatwave day, ABL height is remarkably deep, yet spatial differences in ABL heights are less pronounced due to regionally dry soil conditions, resulting in similar observed surface heat fluxes. Our modeling results provide further insights into ABL characteristics not resolved by the observation network, highlighting synergies between both approaches. Our data and findings will support modeling to help deliver services to a wider community from citizens to those managing health, energy, transport, land use, and other city infrastructure and operations.

Understanding these is of high relevance for developing next-generation numerical weather prediction and climate models. We showcase the campaign and highlight synergies between ground-based and satellite observations and high-resolution numerical weather prediction modeling on two example days.

Row_161,"Urban planning and comprehensive understanding of human-environmental interactions within cities require precise and up-to-date information of urban impervious surfaces. In this regards, the emergence of accurate data, particularly short-range photogrammetric data with high spatial and spectral resolutions has proven to be essential. Urban impervious surfaces are diverse and comopsed of disperate materials; this introduces challenges in the extraction of these surface from remote sensing images. Despite this diversity, only limited types of impervious surfaces (up to six classes) can be diffierenciated in remote sensing approaches, that is insufficient to meet the requirements of researchers, managers, and urban planners. Therefore, this study proposes a novel classification scheme to extract as much information as possible from UAVs visible and elevation data. The substantial influence of classification scheme on segmentation accuracy was assessed. To achieve this objective, a classification scheme consisting of 17 classes was developed to identify the various types of impervious surfaces present in Ahvaz (with diverse impervious surfaces), Iran. Then, UAV RGB and digital elevation model (DEM) images with 5 and 10 cm spatial resolutions, respectively, were segmented through 45 different parameter combinations in the study area. Then, the optimal parameter for segmention the urban impervious surface classes individually and collectively were selected. Finally the images were classified by two methods, namely simple and stratified, using the SVM algorithm. Results demonstrated that impervious surfaces could be accurately extracted in 16 distinct classes with error less than 20%. Image segmentation and classification based on the stratified method in comparison to simple ones improved the urban impervious surface extraction overall accuracy from 72 to 81%, while also improving the minimum user and producer accuracies from 53 and 14 percent to 55 and 62 percent, respectively.

Row_162,"Air pollution episodes are critical environmental challenges in urban areas, primarily linked to the lack of ventilation during calm and stable atmospheric conditions, rather than a significant increase in emissions. The prevailing circulation pattern under these conditions is the Urban Heat Island Circulation (UHIC), which governs the characteristics of the urban pollution dome and the distribution of pollutants. This study aims to assess the UHIC's influence on spatial and temporal variations in pollutant concentrations and to investigate the efficiency of an Urban Chimney (UC) in improving air quality. Due to the interaction of micro- and meso-scale flows, a multi-scale analysis is required. For this purpose, a pressure-based CFD solver is adapted for analyzing airflow and pollutant dispersion in a multi-scale environment. A coordinate transformation method is used to account for meso-scale effects, and the resulting source terms are applied to the solver. The species transport equation is transformed to the new coordinate system, and the effects of species diffusion on enthalpy transport are included in the governing equations. The results demonstrate that UHIC reduces the average pollutant concentration and causes pollution peaks near ground level and at the city center. The interaction of micro-scale flow within the chimney with meso-scale UHIC impacts the flow field and pollutant concentration across the entire domain, decreasing the urban plume's vertical velocity by 40 percent and the mixing height at the city center by 20 percent. It also increases the vertical velocity within the UC by 23 percent. The UC can serve as a controlling tool for urban ventilation, and its capacity to remove pollutants increases sixfold when interacting with UHIC, reducing pollutant concentration citywide.","Mousavi, Donya","Ghaemian, Mohsen","Brinkerhoff, Joshua",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT,Urban heat island circulation,Air pollution dome,Urban chimney,Stable atmospheric condition,Urban ventilation,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 17 2024,Multiscale CFD analysis of urban air pollution dome and ventilation enhancement via an urban chimney

Row_164,"The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented changes to various aspects of daily life, profoundly affecting human mobility. These changes in mobility patterns were not uniform, as numerous factors, including public health measures, socioeconomic status, and urban infrastructure, influenced them. This study examines human mobility changes during COVID-19 in San Diego County and New York City, employing Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) and various network measures to analyze connectivity and socioeconomic status (SES) within these regions. While many COVID-19 and mobility studies have revealed overall reductions in mobility or changes in mobility patterns, they often fail to specify 'where' these changes occur and lack a detailed understanding of the relationship between SES and mobility changes. This creates a significant research gap in understanding the spatial and socioeconomic dimensions of mobility changes during the pandemic. This study aims to address this gap by providing a comprehensive analysis of how mobility patterns varied across different socioeconomic groups during the pandemic. By comparing mobility patterns before and during the pandemic, we aim to shed light on how this unprecedented event impacted different communities. Our research contributes to the literature by employing network science to examine COVID-19's impact on human mobility, integrating SES variables into the analysis of mobility networks. This approach provides a detailed understanding of how social and economic factors influence movement patterns and urban connectivity, highlighting disparities in mobility and access across different socioeconomic groups. The results identify areas functioning as hubs or bridges and illustrate how these roles changed during COVID-19, revealing existing societal inequalities. Specifically, we observed that urban parks and rural areas with national parks became significant mobility hubs during the pandemic, while affluent areas with high educational attainment saw a decline in centrality measures, indicating a shift in urban mobility dynamics and exacerbating pre-existing socioeconomic disparities.","Park, Jaehee","Tsou, Ming-Hsiang","Nara, Atsushi","Dodge, Somayeh","Cassels, Susan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,COMPUTATIONAL URBAN SCIENCE,Urban mobility,Urban spatial structure,Networks,COVID-19,,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 27 2024,Examining human mobility changes during COVID-19 across socioeconomic groups: a comparative analysis of San Diego County and New York City

Yet, the integration of these goals has been underexplored. This study investigates the potential for experiential diversity via active travel in different residential contexts within the Gavle city-region, Sweden. Over 15 months, we collected spatiotemporal data from 165 participants, analyzing 4,362 reported experiences and 13,192 GPS-derived travel trajectories. Our analysis uncovered a significant spatial discrepancy: while the travelled distances to locations of positive experiences typically ranged from 1.5 km to 5 km, active travel predominated only within 1.5 km. This discrepancy persisted across urban, suburban, and peripheral contexts. Although residents in different contexts reported the same types of experiences, urban dwellers travelled about 50 % farther for nature experiences compared with other positive experiences, whereas peripheral dwellers travelled twice the distance for urbanicity experiences compared with other positive experiences. Consequently, urban residents mostly relied on active travel for urbanicity experiences and motorised travel for nature experiences, with the reverse trend observed among peripheral dwellers. These results illustrate the importance of spatial scale for promoting diverse positive experiences via active travel, regardless of residential context. Effective planning strategies may include enhancing environmental diversity near homes and developing infrastructure that favours active over motorised travel for short to moderate distances.","Samuelsson, Karl","Brandt, S.

To help fill the current research void on the distribution patterns and driving mechanisms of urban plant diversity in the tropics, we tested the relationship between plant species richness and land use and anthropogenic and environmental factors in 491 urban functional units (UFUs) in three tropical cities in China (i. e., Zhanjiang, Haikou, and Sanya). The results showed highly significant differences in the distribution of plant richness between different land use types, with the high plant diversity found in residential areas, and leisure and entertainment areas. A positive relationship was found between construction age and spontaneous plant species richness. Furthermore, housing price, trimming and fertilizing frequencies were positively related with cultivated species richness and negatively related with spontaneous species richness. We conclude that urban plant species richness is not the result of a single factor but is influenced by the interaction between anthropogenic factors and environmental factors; although anthropogenic factors play the largest role in determining patterns of urban plant diversity. These results can help decision -makers and managers better understand the current spatial patterns of urban plant diversity, in order to establish and manage urban green space more scientifically and realize sustainable development of urban green space.","Guo, Lin -Yuan","Nizamani, Mir Muhammad","Harris, Aj","Cubino, Josep Padulles","Johnson, Joel B.","Cui, Jian-Peng","Zhang, Hai -Li","Zhou, Jing-Jiang","Zhu, Zhi-Xin","Wang, Hua-Feng",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING,Driving mechanism,Land use,Socioeconomics,Urban Functional Unit,Urban green space maintenance,Plant diversity distribution,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 2024,Anthropogenic factors explain urban plant diversity across three tropical cities in China

However, there are many uncertainties due to the diversity and complexity of the effects of urban and green space forms on the carbon budget. As a result, the role of urban areas and green spaces in emission reduction and carbon sink increases remains ambiguous. We use a landscape sustainability framework and systematically review the literature from 2002 to 2022 to elucidate the interaction between urban and green space forms and the carbon budget. We focus on regional and landscape scales. Nine landscape planning indicators affecting urban area carbon emissions, four indicators affecting green space carbon sinks, and three indicators affecting the urban-green space ecotonal relationship and the carbon budget are derived. We analyze the causes of the differences between the studies and discuss the influences of the indicators on emission reduction, carbon sink increases, and sustainable development.

Row_169,"This study proposes an innovative building energy simulation framework that comprehensively considers multicity scale, long-term, and high-spatial-resolution analysis. The framework incorporates an urban weather generator (UWG) to simulate the bidirectional dynamic interaction between building energy consumption and the urban thermal environment, modeling daily building energy use across 15 German cities over a full year. The findings indicate that regions with high building density, tall structures, and minimal vegetation exhibit greater annual average building energy consumption compared to areas with contrasting features. Temporally, the peak monthly cooling energy consumption (CEC) occurs in July (9.69 TWh), while the highest monthly heating energy consumption (HEC) is in January (17.14 TWh). The daily peak CEC typically arises at 15:00 local solar time (29,169.26 MWh), whereas the daily peak HEC generally happens at 05:00 (33,416.09 MWh). The study also examines the relationship between local climate zones (LCZs) and building energy demand, revealing that as building density or mean height increases, there is a corresponding decrease in annual average cooling and heating energy demand. This suggests that the surface-to-volume ratio of buildings exerts a significant impact on energy use. The framework enables large-scale energy simulations, providing a scientific basis for energyoriented urban planning.","Li, Qingyu","Xu, Genyu","Gu, Ziqi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY,Building energy simulation,Spatial-temporal analysis,Urban weather generator,Local climate zone,Multi-city,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 15 2024,A novel framework for multi-city building energy simulation: Coupling urban microclimate and energy dynamics at high spatiotemporal resolutions

While past research has undertaken a comprehensive analysis of street networks in these communities, a notable gap persists associated with the in-depth interpretation of syntactic data. The present research addresses this gap through a study of six Chinese communities in Sydney, Australia, which are selected based on concentration and diversity census data. The primary research question asked is, ""How are the social-spatial patterns of ethnic communities manifest in Sydney?"" This research aims to reveal hidden socio-spatial characteristics, emphasising variability, concentration, and balance. Space Syntax, widely recognised for its applicability in urban street analysis, has provided multiple quantitative techniques, focusing on the presentation of syntactic maps and average syntactic properties. In contrast, the present research addresses the tendency to report average properties by introducing three statistical distribution indicators (variance, skewness, and kurtosis) to decode six syntactic properties (i_local, i_global, NAIN_local, NAIN_ global, NACH_local, and NACH_ global) derived from axial line and segment analyses. The findings indicate that the statistical distribution analysis effectively characterises the spatial patterns of six of Sydney's ethnic communities, providing valuable insights into socio-cultural organisation, distribution, and interactions in community settings.

Row_173,"The construction of green infrastructure networks is an effective measure to guide orderly city expansion and ensure ecological security. However, limited research has been conducted to explore practical strategies for enhancing ecosystem services threatened by urban development, particularly in plateau cities with constrained natural resources. Xining, the largest and most densely urbanized city on the Tibetan Plateau in China, faces a significant conflict between urban expansion and ecosystem service conservation that is limited by an uninhabitable climate and mountainous topography. It is the only central city on the Tibetan Plateau, with a population of 2.47 million (2020). From 2000 to 2020, the urban area expanded by 37.42%; thus, reconciling the escalating demand for natural resources driven by urban development and promoting synergistic development between ecosystem services and urbanization remains a challenge. Here, we propose a modeling framework to reconstruct ecosystem service values using improved temporal ( p i ) and spatial ( d i ) difference indices, highlighting the temporal sensibility and spatial aggregation of multiple ecosystem services. The material quantities ( d i ) and monetary values ( p i ) of seven ecosystem services were estimated using experimentally verified local parameters as a case study in Xining from 2000 to 2020. The green infrastructure network and its interactions were identified based on the reconstructed ecosystem service value using the gravity modeling toolbox proposed in our previous study. The results illustrated that the identified green infrastructure network comprised 48 ecological sources and 96 corridors, covering an area of 162318.3 hm 2 ; while this includes approximately onefifth of the total study area, but it contributes to one-third of the overall ecosystem service value. The conservation priority and planning construction areas in the Xining City Master Planning (2021 -2035) outlines were then optimized based on the identified green infrastructure network. Overall, these optimized urban planning scenarios would reserve 59.3 million CNY of the reconstructed ecosystem service value encroached on by urban sprawl. The opportunity cost is transferring 14.7% of the planned construction area overlapping with the green infrastructure network.

Our findings revealed that even minor incidents prompt city-wide flow reorganization. Clusters of low resilience with gradients are caused by mobility structures rather than distance from the disaster.

This study selects Shenzhen as a case study and employs a data-driven approach to explore the relationships between bike-sharing and the metro system in practical application, including competition, connection, and complementation. The OPGD model is deployed to assess how the built environment influences these dynamics. The results reveal that bike-sharing typically complements the metro system, with longer ride durations occurring mainly in the urban core areas. Conversely, competitive interactions between these two modes are less frequent and associated with shorter rides, typically occurring in locales with a high density of metro stations.

It employs new historical time series data on population size of cities in Sweden over two centuries (1810-2010) and introduces two schematic growth factors: (i) the intra-city potential and (ii) the extra-city potential located in in rings encircling each city. The first factor is measured by each city's population size, while the second is a vector of distance-discounted population size for each of a city's urban rings. In this way, we can explain a city's growth as a function of its interaction potential inside the city, as well as inside the first, second hand third ring. A robust finding is that cities with large ring potentials follow different development paths than those with small ring potentials. We also find clear evidence of structural change between the two centuries 1810-1910 and 1910-2010. In the first period, city growth is positively impacted by the size of the intra-city potential, whereas the same potential dampens or reduces the growth in the second period. Moreover, the ring potentials outside the city tend to switch from having negative growth stimulation in the first period to having positive stimulation in the second period.","Andersson, Martin","Johansson, Borje","Niedomysl, Thomas",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,ANNALS OF REGIONAL SCIENCE,City systems,Evolution,Urban growth,Size distribution,Spatial interaction,Spatial interdependence,City networks,C21,L84,R11,R12,R30,,,,,DEC 2024,Structural change in city systems evolution

Synergistic control of urban gas emissions at the city level is one of the main issues typically explored. The confounding effect and the interactions between the urban indicators of population and area have been ignored in previous studies. In this study, we examined the spatial distribution characteristics and synergy between greenhouse gases (CO2) and air pollutants (SO2 and NOX) using spatial population and gas emission data. By upgrading the city clustering algorithm (CCA), we established a method for defining active areas of gas emissions (spatial element-coupled clustering, SECC) and identified active areas of gas emissions in China. In this study, we created a research framework that can simultaneously consider the effects of population and area, as well as the possible interactions between these indicators in active areas. The superlinear scaling relationship between the above three gases was revealed at the active zone level, and the existence of synergy between the emission patterns of the three gases was confirmed. Via further model application, we measured the synergistic efficiency of the three gases. It was found that for every 1% increase in SO2 and NOX in an active zone, CO2 increases by 0.86%. In this study, we explored a new perspective and approach to explain the synergy between greenhouse gases and air pollutants.

It is vitally important to optimize the spatial layout of land and efficiency of natural resource allocation, achieve sustainable development, and conduct influence assessment and causation analysis in this region. Here, using the Google Earth Engine platform, we selected Landsat remote-sensing (RS) images from the period 2000-2020 and constructed a remote-sensing ecological index (RSEI) model. Considering the urban spatial pattern division in Chongqing, the Sen + Mann-Kendall analytical approach was employed to assess the fluctuating quality of the ecological environment in different sectors of Chongqing. Subsequently, single-factor and interaction detectors in the Geodetector software tool were used to conduct causation analysis on the RSEI, with the use of eight elements: elevation, slope, aspect, precipitation, temperature, population, land use, and nighttime lighting. Findings indicate that, over the course of the investigation period, the eco-quality in Chongqing displayed a pattern of degradation, succeeded by amelioration. The RSEI decreased from 0.700 in 2000 to 0.590 in 2007, and then gradually recovered to 0.716 in 2018. Overall, the eco-environment quality of Chongqing improved. Spatially, changes in the RSEI were consistent with the planning and positioning of the urban spatial pattern. The main new urban area and periphery of the central urban area showed a slight deterioration, while other regions showed marked improvement. The combined effect of any two elements enhanced the explanatory power of a single factor, with elevation, temperature, and land use being the strongest explanatory elements of eco-quality in Chongqing. The most influential factor explaining the spatial variation of the RSEI was determined to be the combined impact of elevation and land use.

Row_182,"Waiting time is a critical metric for evaluating the quality of online car-hailing services, with studies indicating a close association between Online Car-hailing waiting time (CWT) and the urban built environment (BE). Points of interest (POI) data is widely utilized to characterize the built environment. However, quantifying the proper combination or spatial relationships between different types of POIs to capture the functional features of the built environment within a region poses a challenge. This paper proposes a framework for analyzing built environment characteristics based on a semantic probabilistic topic model utilizing Latent Dirichlet Allocation, demonstrating that integrating the building area of POIs along with the travel activity intensity at their respective locations enables a more precise identification of regional functions. Moreover, while some studies have explored the correlation between the built environment and waiting time, few have evaluated the nonlinear interactions between them. On this foundation, employing the machine learning technique XGBoost model in conjunction with online car-hailing order data, we probe the relationship between the built environment and waiting time. The research indicates that CWT is comprehensively affected by multiple factors. Taking weekday evening peak period as an example, the CWT of Central-urban area, where has dense commercial and office land use, positively correlated with commercial and office topics, while negatively correlated with educational, residential, leisure and healthcare topics, leading to a longer CWT in the Central-urban. In addition, the interaction between BEs can weakens their individual effects on CWT. A higher degree of job-residence balance can mitigate the negative impact of residential and office topics on increasing CWT, particularly in Intermediate-urban areas. Additionally, BE topics may also suppress the positive effect of road density on reducing CWT. The relationship between the BE and CWT exhibits threshold effects and a V-shaped relationship, indicating that the BE is significantly associated with CWT only within specific ranges. This correlation also exhibits a gradient pattern from the Central-urban to the Sub-urban, especially concerning office and residential topics.

Based on the five development concepts, this paper used the entropy method to measure the High Quality Development Index (HQDI) of the five major urban agglomerations. The results showed that the HQDI of the five major urban agglomerations shows a fluctuating upward trend. First, using the Dagum Gini coefficient to explore the sources of HQDI development differences in urban agglomerations, we found that the main source of HQDI differences in urban agglomerations was interregional differences, while intra-regional differences were not important. Second, kernel density estimation was used to test the dynamic evolution trend of HQDI within urban agglomerations. There was a polarisation phenomenon in the HQDI of urban agglomerations, such as the Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration and the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration.

Third, using geographic detectors to examine the driving factors of HQDI in urban agglomerations, we found that the main driving forces for improving HQDI in urban agglomerations were economic growth, artificial intelligence technology and fiscal decentralisation. All the interaction factors had greater explanatory power for the spatial differentiation of HQDI, which can be divided into two types: two-factor improvement and non-linear improvement. This study is conducive to improving and enriching the theoretical system for evaluating the high quality development of urban agglomerations, and provides policy references for promoting the high quality development of urban agglomerations.","Zou, Weiyong","Xu, Lingli",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE,urban agglomeration,High Quality Development Index (HQDI),spatio-temporal evolution,driving factors,,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,Dynamic Development Characteristics and Driving Factors of High Quality Development Level in China's Five Major Urban Agglomerations

Urban soils are a type of currently problematic soil that accumulates a great quantity and diversity of pollutants, a high population load, and a wide range of activities within a very limited area. From 2010 to the present, published studies in the Scopus database on urban soil contamination in various places across the world were studied, evaluated, and discussed. The pollutant levels were statistically processed, and new data were obtained as a consequence of a meta-analysis of the soil contamination and ecological risk indices of the research locations. The soil environment links plants, animals, and humans, as well as living creatures and inanimate substances transported to water and to the air environment. Activities in the soil have as a final destination groundwater, recycling, and reproducing pollutants and chemicals, with heavy metals or potential toxic elements as the major actors. Soil-based urban pollution is of particular concern in soil science as it may be a rising risk for the environment and humanity in the near future.","Golia, Evangelia E.","Bethanis, John","Xagoraris, Christos","Tziourrou, Pavlos",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,urban soils,soil pollution,heavy metals,potentially toxic elements.,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024,"Potentially Toxic Elements in Urban and Peri-Urban Soils - A Critical Meta-Analysis of their Sources, Availability, Interactions, and Spatial Distribution"

While it is well-known that the urban physical environment affects mental health, research on the physical characteristics of spaces remains limited. This study aims to explore relationship -oriented space characteristics that can form social networks and reduce depressive symptoms in older adults. After analyzing the differences in social interaction spaces between high -density and low -density areas for older adults in Seoul, we identified social interaction spaces (parks and traditional markets) that are frequently used based on on -site interview results. Two areas were selected for the questionnaire surveys. The main findings revealed that older adults living in areas with diverse spatial planning and close physical relationships between parks and traditional markets, convenient pedestrian environments, and lower population density of older adults had better social networks and lower depressive symptoms. More significantly, the physical characteristics of parks and traditional markets (convenient accessibility, maximized visibility, connectivity, and territoriality) significantly facilitate social interactions. Those engaging in social interactions within these spaces exhibited significantly better social networks and lower depressive symptoms. These findings underscore the importance of considering relationship -oriented space characteristics in spatial and urban planning. (c) 2023 Higher Education Press Limited Company.

Row_186,"The delivery of ecosystem services (ESs), particularly in urban agglomerations, faces substantial threats from impending future climate change and human activity. Assessing ES bundles (ESBs) is critical to understanding the spatial allocation and interactions between multiple ESs. However, dynamic projections of ESBs under various future scenarios are still lacking, and their underlying driving mechanisms have received insufficient attention. This study examined the Beijing -Tianjin -Hebei urban agglomeration and proposed a framework that integrates patch -generating land use simulation into three shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios and clustering analysis to assess spatiotemporal variations in seven ESs and ESBs from 1990 to 2050. The spatial trajectories of ESBs were analyzed to identify fluctuating regions susceptible to SSP scenarios. The results indicated that (1) different scenarios exhibited different loss rates of regulating and supporting services, where the mitigation of degradation was most significant under SSP126. The comprehensive ES value was highest under SSP245. (2) Bundles 1 and 2 (dominated by regulating and supporting services) had the largest total proportion under SSP126 (51.92 %). The largest total proportion of Bundles 4 and 5 occurred under SSP585 (48.96 %), with the highest provisioning services. The SSP126 scenario was projected to have the least ESB fluctuation at the grid scale, while the most occurred under SSP585. (3) Notably, synergies between regulating/supporting services were weaker under SSP126 than under either SSP245 or SSP585, while trade-offs between water yield and non provisioning services were strongest. (4) Forestland and grassland proportions significantly affected carbon sequestration and habitat quality. Climatic factors (precipitation and temperature) acted as the dominant drivers of provisioning services, particularly water yield. Our findings advocate spatial strategies for future regional ES management to address upcoming risks.","Ai, Xin","Zheng, Xi","Zhang, Yaru","Liu, Yang","Ou, Xiaoyang","Xia, Chunbo","Liu, Lingjun",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,Beijing -Tianjin -Hebei,Driving factors,Shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs),Trade-offs and synergies,PLUS,Scenario simulation,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 20 2024,Climate and land use changes impact the trajectories of ecosystem service bundles in an urban agglomeration: Intricate interaction trends and driver identification under SSP-RCP scenarios
Row_187,"Predicting the trajectories of neighboring vehicles is vital for self-driving cars in intricate real-world driving. The challenge lies in accounting for diverse influences on a vehicle's movement, travel needs, neighboring vehicles, and a local map. To address these factors comprehensively, we have developed a framework with a Heterogeneous Graph Social (HGS) pooling approach. The framework represents vehicles and infrastructures in a single graph, with vehicle nodes holding historical dynamics information and infrastructure nodes containing spatial features from map images. HGS captures vehicle-infrastructure interactions in urban driving. Unlike existing methods that are restricted to a fixed vehicle count and highway settings, HGS can accommodate variable interactions and road layouts. By merging all features, our approach predicts the target vehicle's future path. Experiments on real-world data confirm HGS's superiority, boasting quicker training and inference, affirming its feasibility, effectiveness, and efficiency.","Mo, Xiaoyu","Xing, Yang","Lv, Chen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART E-LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION REVIEW,Trajectory prediction,Connected vehicles,Graph neural networks,Heterogeneous interactions,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2024,Heterogeneous graph social pooling for interaction-aware vehicle trajectory prediction
Row_188,"Currently, Chinese villages are grappling with the issue of regional value collapse within the long-standing 'urban-rural dual system' strategy. Characteristic villages, as integral components of the urban-rural hierarchical spatial system and pivotal agents in rural development, wield significant influence in addressing China's rural crises. The construction practice of characteristic villages showcases the cognitive evolution of 'element-industry-function-type'. Within the value perception of characteristic villages, these practices reflect fundamental orientations in the interaction between humans and land, emphasizing the symbiotic relationship between production, life, and ecology. In alignment with this value perception, and drawing upon the existing studies on the classification of characteristic village types in Jixi County, this paper establishes a comprehensive type knowledge graph of characteristic villages. The framework of this graph's expression revolves around 'spatial elements-spatial combination-spatial organization'. This graph delineates a knowledge progression encompassing 'information-knowledge-strategy', characterized by three levels: the factual knowledge graph, conceptual knowledge graph and regular knowledge graph. The type knowledge graph systematically accumulates insights derived from the spatiotemporal transmission path of the village spatial structure. It formulates a structured progression of knowledge as follows: cognition of the village entity information -> analysis of the village landscape structure -> examination of the village social relationships. This constructed graph translates type-data information into spatial strategy knowledge, serving as a pivotal process in amalgamating characteristic village spatial data with semantic networks, particularly in expressing authenticity inspection and gene transfer.","Ren, Kai","Buyandelger, Khaliun",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,LAND,characteristic village type,characteristic village practice,universal geographic interface,knowledge progression,characteristic production relations,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2024,"Construction of a Type Knowledge Graph Based on the Value Cognitive Turn of Characteristic Villages: An Application in Jixi, Anhui Province, China"

This study focused on the urban building spaces of ""furnace city "" Fuzhou and explored the quantitative relationships between urban features and ECOSTRESS diurnal LSTs from a block perspective. Our results revealed that: (1) Compared to the ordinary least squares regression model, the multi-scale geographically weighted regression model can better capture the spatiotemporal non-stationary relationships. (2) Largest patch index of building patches (LPI_B) and building height (BH) have the greatest impact on the variations in daytime and nighttime LSTs, respectively.

Based on a multimethod research design that combines narrative city walks, participant observations, secondary research, and in-depth interviews, this study takes two older neighborhoods in the Northwest New Territories of Hong Kong as case sites to examine, elaborate on, and envisage the idea of constructing smart neighborhoods through digital placemaking. It finds that neighborhood residents are potentially the most significant actors and hosts of smart spatial attributes. The mechanism emerges through people's diverse and technologically mediated interactions. At the neighborhood scale, the everyday urban smart neighborhood is produced via individuals' socializing and the sharing of information about events. Smart neighborhoods are facilitated and sustained by relatively practical and simple technologies, and their making is more an approach for improving the quality of urban life than a designated goal to achieve. This research concludes that residents' digital placemaking plays a significant role in developing lived smart cities.

As the highest form of spatial organization at the mature stage of urbanization, an urban agglomeration (UA) can be a key area for studying this urban-ecology interaction. This study integrated the urbanization evaluation, ecosystem services value (ESV) assessment, and optimized coupling coordination degree (CCD) models to explore the coupling coordination of urbanization and ESV at the UA scale. Analyzing data from the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei UA (BTHUA) from 1985 to 2020 revealed that: (1) urbanization continues to increase and ESV fluctuates; however, both exhibit significant spatial heterogeneity.

Row_192,"Contemporary contingency planning is largely delinked from urban planning. However, the two domains intersect in critical ways. Contingency planning frames conditions for displaced persons in emergency situations but also affects the design of everyday urban spaces. Thus, the spatial output of emergency preparedness can encourage wellbeing and placemaking in both emergency and non -emergency situations. This article explores the built environments of contingency planning in Norwegian cities, paying particular attention to emergency reception. Furthermore, this article outlines the relationship between the policies of reception in displacement management and the spatial policies of placemaking. A study of Norwegian contingency planning history shows that the former evacuation shelter typology is being replaced by the more loosely defined concept of places of protection , similar to the retrofitted spaces commonly used as asylum centres. Newspaper clippings and document reviews are used to study two emergency reception structures: a Cold War multipurpose mountain hall close to the Norway -Russia border and a transformed 1970s warehouse near Oslo that currently houses the Norwegian national arrival facility for asylum -seekers. Comparing these two cases outlines the interaction between displacement management, contingency planning, and urban planning and contributes to conceptualising what we call contingency urbanism . We suggest that contingency urbanism can be useful in re-spatialising emergency architecture, re -linking contingency and urban planning, and pointing to placemaking opportunities in the duality of everyday life and a state of emergency.","Breivik-Khan, Havard","Hemmersam, Peter",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,WELLBEING SPACE AND SOCIETY,Architecture,Contingency planning,Displacement Emergency,Placemaking,Urbanism,,,,,,,,,,,,2024,The Mountain Hall and the Smart Club: The Architecture of Emergency Reception in Norwegian Cities

Row_194,"Climate change impacts global weather patterns, leading to more frequent and intense extreme weather events. Floods and droughts are the primary hazards caused by climate change, for the number of events, people affected, and global economic impacts. While traditionally addressed separately, their interconnectedness is increasingly recognized in research, policies, and practices. However, research on their interactions is limited, especially in urban areas. Therefore, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the interaction between floods and droughts by analyzing their similarities and differences. This understanding will inform multi-hazard analysis and guide urban planning. A literature review was conducted to analyze the existing body of knowledge on floods, droughts, and their interactions, specifically focusing on cities in the context of climate change and risk. First, an analysis of the characteristics and differences between floods and droughts highlights the primary distinction lies in their temporal and spatial spread. Droughts are slow-onset events that impact large areas over extended periods, while floods are rapid-onset events with a more concentrated impact. Additionally, the review identifies commonalities between the two hazards, such as shared causes, cascading effects, mutually negative impacts, potential for joint management strategies, commonly affected sectors, geographical distribution patterns, frequently cited case studies, a growing focus on urban areas, and crucial knowledge gaps that require further investigation. Finally, the paper presents a novel framework for analyzing the interconnected risks of floods and droughts. This framework emphasizes the importance of comprehensive data collection, including risk factors, contextual information, drivers, impacts, responses, and historical event data. This holistic approach aims to improve understanding of these interconnected hazards' combined causes and effects. The article argues for a paradigm shift in urban planning towards a multi-hazard, multi-sectoral, resilient, and adaptable approach that considers both floods and droughts in the context of climate change.

Row_195,"Due to the rapid development of urban transport, the construction of viaducts has changed the spatial layout in the past and left some leftover spaces underneath the bridges that have not been properly utilised. At the same time, digital technology has been continuously applied to the analysis process of the design of the reuse of leftover space. However, the form-oriented approach to digital analysis and application in the design process of leftover spaces has neglected the analysis of the needs of people's activities in the space, resulting in the restriction of people's behaviour in interacting with the space, as well as the weakening of the natural perception and historical and cultural impression of the environment of the reused leftover space. This article focuses on strengthening the analysis of spatial-behavioural interactions in digital applications in the design process by incorporating theoretical approaches such as the behavioural signs method, the AEIOU method, and narrative design, to strengthen the analysis of the history, culture, and human needs of the leftover space in digital technology for the development of human-centred and sustainable design, and to link the historical significance of the leftover space closely with the contemporary people's ways of activity, to solve the problem of the lack of digital analyses in the process of the design of the leftover space based on the habits of human behaviours and the spatial experience. Ultimately, the aim is to make the application of digital technology in the process of designing for the reuse of leftover space pay more attention to the interaction between people and space: how human behaviour affects the generation of space, to perpetuate and develop the past and contemporary value of space, and to further promote the development of the design practice of the reuse of leftover space in the direction of being more sustainable and more humane.","Luo, Yidan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,"HCI INTERNATIONAL 2024 POSTERS, PT VII, HCII 2024",,Spatial-Behavioural Interaction,Digitisation,Leftover Spaces,Reuse,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024,Design of Digitally Reused Leftover Spaces Based on Spatial and Behavioural Interaction
Row_196,"Accelerating urbanisation and associated lifestyle changes result in loss of biodiversity and diminished wellbeing of people through fewer direct interactions and experiences with nature. In this review, we propose the notion of urban wilding (the promotion of autonomous ecological processes that are independent of historical land-use conditions, with minimal direct human maintenance and planting interventions) and investigate its propensity to improve biodiversity and people-nature connections in cities. Through a large interdisciplinary synthesis, we explore the ecological mechanisms through which urban wilding can promote biodiversity in cities, investigate the attitudes and relations of city dwellers towards urban wild spaces, and discuss the integration of urban wilding into the fabric of cities and its governance. We show that favouring assembly spontaneity by reducing planting interventions, and functional spontaneity by limiting maintenance practices, can promote plant diversity and provide ecological resources for numerous organisms at habitat and city scales. These processes could reverse biotic homogenisation, but further studies are needed to understand the effects of wilding on invasive species and their consequences. From a socio-ecological perspective, the attitudes of city dwellers towards spontaneous vegetation are modulated by successional stages, with grassland and woodland stages preferred, but dense shrubby vegetation stages disliked. Wild spaces can diversify physical interactions with nature, and enrich multi-sensory, affective and cognitive experiences of nature in cities. However, some aspects of wild spaces can cause anxiety, feeling unsafe, and the perception of abandonment. These negative attitudes could be mitigated by subtle design and maintenance interventions. While nature has long been thought of as ornamental and instrumental in cities, urban wilding could help to develop relational and intrinsic values of nature in the fabric of cities. Wildness and its singular aesthetics should be combined with cultural norms, resident uses and urban functions to plan and design urban spatial configurations promoting human-non-human cohabitation. For urban wilding to be socially just and adapted to the needs of residents, its implementation should be backed by inclusive governance opening up discussion forums to residents and urban workers. Scientists can support these changes by collaborating with urban actors to design and experiment with new wild spaces promoting biodiversity and wellbeing of people in cities.","Bonthoux, Sebastien","Chollet, Simon",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS,rewilding,transdisciplinarity,urban landscape,conservation science,socio-ecological system,people-nature connection,urban biodiversity,nature experience,urban planning,urban design,,,,,,,AUG 2024,Wilding cities for biodiversity and people: a transdisciplinary framework

Given that cardiometabolic diseases are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in people living in urban areas, transforming cities and urban provisioning systems (or urban systems) toward health, equity, and economic productivity can enable the dual attainment of climate and health goals. Seven urban provisioning systems that provide food, energy, mobility-connectivity, housing, green infrastructure, water management, and waste management lie at the core of human health, well-being, and sustainability. These provisioning systems transcend city boundaries (eg, demand for food, water, or energy is met by transboundary supply); thus, transforming the entire system is a larger construct than local urban environments. Poorly designed urban provisioning systems are starkly evident worldwide, resulting in unprecedented exposures to adverse cardiometabolic risk factors, including limited physical activity, lack of access to heart-healthy diets, and reduced access to greenery and beneficial social interactions. Transforming urban systems with a cardiometabolic health-first approach could be accomplished through integrated spatial planning, along with addressing current gaps in key urban provisioning systems.

However, few empirical studies explored both energy sufficiency and efficiency inequality in rural and urban households at the sub-national level within a nation during a rapid urbanization period to inform equitable energy transitions. Therefore, this research collected 2000-2019 subnational-level data in China to explore the pattern of rural-vs-urban inequality in energy use per person (indicating sufficiency) and energy use intensity (EUI, indicating efficiency). Gini coefficients and disparity ratios, two social inequality measurements, were used to quantify social inequality in energy use. Fixed effect models with interaction terms were adopted to explore the impact of income, energy end-use structure, and floor area on energy use differences between rural and urban households. Gini coefficients of both energy measurements decreased by 43%-47% from 2000 to 2019, suggesting a more equitable distribution of end-use energy sufficiency and efficiency between urban and rural households. Rural-vs-urban disparity ratios showed that rural households in more provinces used more energy per person with higher EUI than urban households in 2019, compared to the pattern observed in 2000. Income in rural households had a statistically significant larger impact on energy use per person and EUI than that in urban households. By evaluating energy inequality in both sufficiency and efficiency from an overlooked rural-vs-urban perspective, this study enhances the understanding of social inequality in energy use and provides valuable insights into just energy transitions in urbanizing and developing countries.","Sun, Shuyu","Tong, Kangkang",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,APPLIED ENERGY,Energy inequality,Rural-urban disparities,Energy sufficiency,Energy efficiency,Spatial-temporal pattern,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 15 2024,Rural-urban inequality in energy use sufficiency and efficiency during a rapid urbanization period

UBGS publicness reflects whether it supports and facilitates community formation.

This study took Changsha as the case study and evaluated its UBGS publicness in 2012, 2016, and 2020. We analyzed the evolution of the UBGS publicness pattern, and the results indicated the following: (1) The elements accessibility indicator showed a decreasing trend year by year and maintained the pattern of low in the city center and high in the suburban area; (2) the functional diversity indicator changed from a monocentric polarized spatial pattern to a polycentric and balanced spatial pattern; (3) the structural connectivity indicator generally improved and showed the core-edge pattern; and (4) the comprehensive indicator showed that the pattern developed from the core edge to the core edge as the primary focus with fan-shaped expansion supplemented. Based on this, combined with Changsha's urban development history, environmental, policy, economic, and social factors supported, led, promoted, and guided the formation and evolution of the UBGS publicness pattern.

Some spatial dependencies, especially those formed by different traffic modes, are not fully exploited, and how to simultaneously consider spatial and temporal dependencies and effectively integrate them within a single prediction framework needs further exploration. To tackle the above issues, we propose a multi-view spatial-temporal graph convolutional framework MVSTG, which adequately exploits the multi-view spatial-temporal dependencies and their interactions to improve the accuracy of traffic prediction. Multi-view temporal learning captures the multiple temporal trends by temporal convolution from multi-granularity historical data, and multi-view spatial learning handles the multiple spatial correlations by graph convolution from multiple graphs. In addition, view-wise attention-based fusion is proposed to adaptively identify the importance of each upstream view, fuse the multi-view information, and generate integrated results for downstream views.

Emerging repercussions out of such a rising interest need to be handled by marine spatial planning (MSP) as a means of properly allocating marine space to diverse uses; managing conflicts and promoting synergies among them; and pursuing a multi-use perspective of this space. A critical stage of each MSP exercise is the exploration of land- and marine-based policy directions and their current or potential repercussions in the marine environment. Such an exploration is carried out in this work by means of a qualitative policy review for informing the MSP process in the Northern Aegean Sea, Greece. By delving into diverse policy frameworks at various spatial levels-i.e., local (urban), regional, and national/European-constraints, but also perspectives in policy choices/maritime uses in the MSP context, are identified, thus guiding more informed MSP choices in the specific study region while attaining a successful integration or coordination between land and marine developments.","Gourgiotis, Anestis","Koutsi, Dionisia","Krommyda, Vasiliki","Stratigea, Anastasia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,OCEANS-SWITZERLAND,land-to-sea interaction,marine policy directions,multilevel spatial and developmental frameworks,marine spatial planning (MSP),Northern Aegean Sea,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2024,"Spatial and Developmental Policy Directions Affecting Marine Spatial Planning in the Northern Aegean Sea, Greece"

Community gardens help increase interactions in resettlement communities and facilitate the integration of resettled residents into the community. This paper, based on the differing characteristics of resettled and non-resettled villagers in China's resettlement communities and the scarcity of outdoor public space, studies the participation willingness of resettled residents and their preferences for the construction of community gardens. Firstly, this study establishes a system of community garden construction elements for resettlement communities and conducts a Likert scale survey of residents in 30 resettlement communities in Beijing (n = 832). Secondly, variance analysis is used to explore the impact of demographic characteristics on garden preferences. Finally, a multiple linear regression model is employed to study the correlation between resettled residents' willingness to participate in community gardens and the construction elements. The results show that (1) both resettled villagers and non-villagers have a willingness to participate in community gardens, and the spatial enhancement, facility supplementation, economic compensation, community integration, and identity recognition of garden construction elements are positively correlated with residents' willingness to participate, with spatial enhancement having the strongest effect; (2) community gardens help achieve integration between resettled and non-resettled villagers; (3) gardens help enhance the identity recognition of resettled villagers. In summary, integrating community gardens into resettlement communities helps increase residents' social interactions, enhances their sense of belonging, and assists resettled residents in integrating into urban society.","Liu, Ye","Ma, Mingxin","Zhou, Siqiao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,BUILDINGS,village resettlement communities,resettled villagers,non-resettled villagers,community gardens,spatial environment,multiple linear regression (MLR),,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2024,Evaluation of Resettled Residents' Engagement in Community Gardens and Preferences for Garden Development Factors in Beijing
Row_207,"Resilience studies have long been a focal point in the fields of geography, social science, urban studies, and psychology. Recently, resilience studies from multiple disciplines have scrutinized resilience at an individual scale. As one important behavior in the daily life of human beings, travel behavior is characterized by spatial dependence, spatiotemporal dynamics, and group heterogeneity. Moreover, how to understand the interaction between travel behavior (or demand) and transportation supply and their dynamics is a fundamental question in transportation studies when transportation systems encounter unexpected disturbances. This paper refines the definition of travel behavior resilience based on fundamental theories from multiple disciplines, including ecology, transportation engineering, and psychology. Additionally, this paper proposes a conceptual theoretical framework of travel behavior resilience based on the dynamic equilibrium characteristics of transportation supply and demand. In general, travel behavior has three stages of variation, namely, dramatic reduction, rapid growth, and fluctuation recovery, which have helped capture the travel behavior resilience triangle. Then, we construct a corresponding evaluation methodology that is suitable for multiscale and multidimensional perspectives. We emphasize that the evaluation of travel behavior resilience should be process-oriented with temporal continuity or capture the inflection points of travel behavior. Using multisource big data such as mobile phone signaling data and smart card data, this paper reviews empirical studies on travel behavior resilience, exploring its spatial heterogeneity and group differences. With location-based analysis, we confirm that people show greater travel behavior resilience in places where people engage in various socioeconomic activities. The group-based analysis shows that age and socioeconomic attributes of mobility groups significantly affect travel behavior resilience. Travel behavior resilience can be one pillar, offering geographic perspectives in resilience studies. In the future, the study of travel behavior resilience at multiple scales and from multiple perspectives can explore the spatial heterogeneity of transportation re-equilibrium and travel modal differences, contributing to urban spatial structure studies. Studying travel behavior resilience can provide scientific and technological support for urban management and resilient city construction.","Huang, Jie","Wang, Jiaoe",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES,resilience,residential travel,social group,urban transportation,big data,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 2024,"Travel behavior resilience: Theory, method, and empirical studies"
Row_208,"An existing disparity between the actual and planned land use function for a given parcel highlights a knowledge gap in how mixed-use residential parcels influence burglary spatial patterns. To bridge this gap, our study leverages land use data and Points of Interest (POIs) to categorize residential land into distinct types, and further explore the influence of mixed-use residential land and housing types on the spatial distribution of burglary rates. Key findings reveal that: 1) Residential land can be segmented into three distinct categories: pure residential, residential-office, and residential-commercial. 2) While a significant relationship is not observed between residential-office land and burglary, both pure residential and residential-commercial land exhibit a notable increase in burglary occurrences, with the latter exerting the most significant impact. 3) Notably, the commercial environment significantly heightens the attractiveness of high-end commercial housing for burglary, whereas for affordable housing, the commercial environment enhances its deterrent effect against burglary. This dichotomy is attributed to the spatial service scope and target clientele of commercial facilities. The findings furnish a scientific rationale for burglary prevention and control strategies across diverse community types, ultimately contributing to a safer urban environment. Furthermore, the implications of this research are applicable to cities globally grappling with the challenge of managing mixed-use residential land safety in the context of urbanization.","Song, Guangwen","Zheng, Jiaxin","Feng, Jiaxin","Li, Xiaoxue","Zhang, Chunxia","Xiao, Luzi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,CITIES,Residential land,Commercial function,Office function,Housing types,Burglary,Interaction effects,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2025,Unraveling the complex nexus: How residential land with diverse functions shapes the spatial dynamics of urban burglary

The study foregrounds challenges in urban development, especially in developing regions, where uncontrolled growth impacts POS and living standards. The significance of POSs' roles as hubs for social interaction, environmental conservation, and leisure activities is emphasized. The article delves into how emotional cartography and concepts like Topophilia can effectively capture users' perceptions of these spaces, aiding in urban planning by understanding the socio-environmental value of POSs. A key component of this review is an in-depth bibliometric analysis, which maps the academic landscape surrounding emotional cartography. This analysis uncovers the methods used in emotional mapping, including crowdsourcing, biosensors, and social networks, and identifies a significant research gap in emotional maps for subjective population analysis, particularly in developing nations.

This study focuses on analyzing the habitability conditions in peri-urban areas of Concepci & oacute;n del Uruguay, Argentina, which have experienced disorderly and unplanned development. Through the application of objective and subjective indicators, we sought to understand the socio -territorial disparities and the local patterns of spatial identification that influence the quality of life of the population. The results reveal significant deficiencies in key aspects such as health quality, environmental vulnerability and urban accessibility. Poor water and sewage management, along with irregular urban waste collection services, as well as the location of homes close to industrial zones and waste dumps, pose substantial challenges for the well-being of the inhabitants. The lack of access to educational and health facilities, green spaces and public transport stands out as a widespread problem. A majority satisfaction is revealed with the quality of air, water and soil. However, low levels of satisfaction are recorded with regard to drinking water and sanitation services. Regarding the perception of environmental risk, it varies widely due to proximity to industries or lack of knowledge.

To investigate and relieve these sensitivities, a tri-system risk assessment framework is devised, consisting of indicator, griding, and risk assessment systems. The entropy, CRITIC, and game theory (GT) are integrated to weigh the fifteen indicators for the Zhengzhou City area. The risk assessment method based on GT and additive model achieved the best performance: (1) 90.39% actual waterlogged sites are in the High and Very High-risk areas; (2) the area under the ROC curve (AUC) value is 0.791; (3) it is competitive in Accuracy, Zero-One Loss, Recall, and F1-score. In the analyzing results, the total High and Very-High risk areas account for 20.34% of the city.

Row_212,"As a significant manifestation of human activities influencing natural environment, rapid urbanization has enhanced economic prosperity while simultaneously posing threats to ecological quality. Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), the core region of the Yangtze River Delta (CYRD), and the Pearl River Delta (PRD) stand as three major economic centers characterized by the highest level of urbanization in China, encompassing areas of heightened ecological sensitivity. Nevertheless, the ecological quality at the scale of urban agglomerations remains ambiguous, with many studies failing to develop a comprehensive and effective method for comparing diverse urban agglomerations. Consequently, this study integrates multi-source remote sensing data, including information on land cover and other socio-economic parameters, to construct the Ecological Quality Index (EQI) based on the ""Function-Interaction-Pressure-Stability"" (FIPS) framework. Through a stratified determination of indicator weights grounded in both objective importance and empirical knowledge, we mapped the spatiotemporal changes of EQI and analyzed the impact of urbanization on ecological quality in three urban agglomerations from 2001 to 2020. We determined the following: (1) The calculated EQI can further capture the nuanced details with better performance at both underlining the discrepancy of highs and lows of EQI and describing the spatial detail of urban agglomerations' characteristics. (2) Substantial disparities in EQI and its changes are evident across different urban agglomerations. Notably, only the average EQI improves in PRD, while ecological degradation is prominent in specific regions, such as the southeastern plains of BTH area, along the Yangtze River, and around Shanghai in CYRD and central PRD. The CYRD exhibits the largest affected area. (3) Urbanization predominantly influences ecological quality through land cover transitions. In expansion areas, ecological deterioration is significantly more pronounced, constituting approximately 90% of the total area. (4) Despite significant urbanization, city-level analysis in CYRD reveals a better coordination between urban expansion and ecological protection, with a lower intensity of ecological degradation compared to urban expansion rates. Conversely, some cities in the BTH, despite modest urban expansion, exhibit substantial declines in ecological quality, highlighting the need for targeted policy interventions. In conclusion, this study elucidates the intricate relationship between urbanization and ecological quality, offering valuable insights for the development of targeted protection strategies and sustainable urban planning.","Guo, Yinkun","Zhao, Siqing","Zhao, Xiang","Wang, Haoyu","Shi, Wenxi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,,REMOTE SENSING,ecological quality,evaluation framework,synergistic index,urban expansion,spatial heterogeneity,cold/hot spot analysis,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2024,Evaluation of the Spatiotemporal Change of Ecological Quality under the Context of Urban Expansion-A Case Study of Typical Urban Agglomerations in China

These areas, where population density and agricultural production are low, have a complex social, economic and natural structure that cannot be handled from a single perspective. This situation necessitates a multidimensional approach to rural areas and rurality. The study aims to address the socio-demographicand economic structure of Turkey's provinces with a multidimensional approach and to analyze them comparatively. The data set of the study consists of 14 socio-demographic and 15 economic variables used in defining rural-urban areas. Three different clustering analysis methods (K-means, Ward, Two Step) were used in the study in which SPSS program was applied. As a result of the analyzes made with three clustering methods, the spatial distribution of the ruralness levels of the provinces was mapped and the variables that lead to cluster formation were determined. The results of these cluster analyses conducted with different methods at the NUTS-3 level in Turkey include a methodological discussion and a comparative determination. Although there are spatial differences as a result of the analysis of rurality with both socio-demographic and economic variables, the general similarity of the clusters formed by the three methods is significant.

However, the impact of LUT on the spatial pattern of ESs in the region over the past 20 years is not clear. This study aimed to explore LUT characteristics of the urban agglomeration on the UATM using a land transfer matrix, information entropy, land utilization intensity, and land utilization dynamic degree. Various ESs indexes were quantitatively measured using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model, and the effect of LUT on ESs was revealed through a geographic detector and spatial auto -correlation analyses. The results of this study led to the following conclusions: First, between 2000 and 2020, the primary land utilization types in UATM were arable land, grassland, and bare land, with significant cross -transformations occurring among these types. Meanwhile, LUT showed marked differences among different regions. LUT changed rapidly and significantly in the central region; in contrast, slower and slight changes were observed in the northern and southern regions. Second, during the research period, habitat maintenance, water yield and carbon sequestration decreased, and the soil retention function increased. The accelerated urban development in the second decade led to more rapid changes in ESs. Finally, both the structure and intensity of land utilization showed the strongest explanatory capability for changes in ESs. Different dimensions of LUT showed significant interactions with ESs. Therefore, it is advisable to guide LUT scientifically, promote vegetation restoration projects, alleviate the impacts of human activities and climate change on ESs, and enhance the ecological safety and environmental sustainability of UATM and even arid regions in Central Asia.","Song, Xiaojun","Chen, Fu","Sun, Yan","Ma, Jing","Yang, Yongjun","Shi, Guoqing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,Ecosystem services (ESs),Geographic detector,Land utilization transformation (LUT),InVEST model,Spatial auto -correlation analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 2024,"Effects of land utilization transformation on ecosystem services in urban agglomeration on the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains, China"

But the possibilities of modern software that allows detecting intraagglomeration spatial reserves - spatial potentials - on cartographic models are not taken into account. The work uses spatial -functional and synergetic (agglomeration) approaches, as well as potential method, statistical method and cartographic modeling. We reveal the theoretical basis for the formation of spatial potentials in the intra-agglomeration environment and propose a methodological approach to their determination based on agglomeration effects of demographic, settlement and economic structures of the Saint Petersburg agglomeration. According to the calculations obtained, we design cartographic models that correspond to the structures under consideration and reflect spatial potentials of agglomeration effects, which are represented by groups of five clusters. The levels of clusters of spatial potentials and their configurations are obtained with the help of the neural network software ""Surfer Golden Software"". We find that groups of clusters within the demographic and settlement potentials structure - gravitational, high -potential, medium -potential and low -potential - have smaller territorial impact areas in contrast to similar groups of clusters of economic structure. At the same time, a very lowpotential cluster of demographic and settlement structure significantly exceeds the area of the similar cluster of economic structure and spreads beyond the cities located in the eastern and southeastern parts of the Saint Petersburg agglomeration periphery. The areas for future research are related to the development of new methodological approaches and techniques aimed at searching for and modeling agglomeration effects and their spatial potentials in the functional structures of individual cities, urban agglomerations or regions (investment, innovation, environmental, transport, service, cultural and other structures).

This study aims to use multidimensional connectivity network analysis to answer the role of landscape resources as a connecting medium (represented by linear canals) penetrating the urban-rural space in urban-rural integration. First, this study proposes a framework of ""Urban-Canal-Rural"" from a multidimensional perspective. In this research, we re-examined the urban-rural differences within the region by using the canal as the central regional conduit connecting urban and rural areas. Then, an association network based on five dimensions was constructed, and the network's connectivity was detected. In light of this, the integration characteristics and factor flow mechanism of ""Urban-Canal-Rural"" were revealed. Based on the study, we identified the potential interactive advantages of urban-rural integration within the canal basin, which provides the strategy for the development of ""Urban-Canal-Rural"" integration. The study found that within the same region, ""Urban-Canal-Rural"" shows completely different correlation strengths in five dimensions, revealing that the urban-rural differences in the process of urbanization are closely related to the inadequate utilization of resources. It also confirmed the importance of multidimensional network construction in balancing the allocation of resources between urban and rural areas in the process of urban-rural integration. Finally, the relations of factor mobility and resource allocation to sustainable urban and rural development were discussed. The authors argued that core resources between rural and urban areas are the key variable in restructuring rural-urban relations to achieve sustainable development. In general, urban and rural development should maintain the integrity and balance of the regional system. Additionally, this study provides Chinese experience for the worldwide study of urban-rural sustainable development.How to scrutinize the new interaction and balance between urban and rural areas is an unavoidable topic for urban and rural development. Examining the issue of urban-rural differences in the process of urbanization from a dynamic and systematic perspective, we found a close relationship between the balance and utilization of regional resources and regional differences.

This study aimed to systematically evaluate the ESs of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River Urban Agglomeration (MRYRUA) across multiple spatial and temporal scales, thereby enhancing ecosystem management and informed scientific decision-making. Specifically, this study employed the InVEST model, hot spot analysis, a geographically weighted regression model, and self-organizing feature mapping combined with K-means clustering to systematically quantify the spatiotemporal characteristics, trade-offs, synergies, and ecosystem service clusters of habitat quality (HQ), water yield (WY), carbon storage (CS), soil conservation (SC), and landscape aesthetics (LA) at grid and county scales from 2000 to 2020. The results revealed the following: (1) There was significant spatial heterogeneity among various ESs, with an overall spatial pattern exhibiting layered and interwoven variations. (2) Trade-offs predominantly characterized the relationships among ESs in the MRYRUA, with the absolute values of correlation coefficients mostly reaching their nadir in 2010. The interaction strengths between HQ and CS, and between CS and SC, increased with scale, while the relationships and strengths between LA and other ESs were less affected by scale changes. (3) At the grid scale, five types of ecosystem service bundles (ESBs) were identified, whereas at the district scale, four types of ESBs were delineated, including three common types: the WY-LA synergy bundle, Ecological transition bundle, and Key synergetic bundle, and three distinct types: the HQ-CS synergy bundle, Integrated ecological bundle, and Key synergetic bundle. The transitions of these ESBs over the 20 year period generally exhibited fluctuating evolutionary characteristics, with more pronounced fluctuations as the scale expanded.

U-S-R transition zones (U-S-RTZ) are also highlighting the function diversity and landscape heterogeneity across territorial spaces. As a super megacity in western China, Chengdu's rapid urbanization has driven the evolution of U-S-R spaces, resulting in a sequential structure. To promote the high-quality spatial development of urban-rural region in a structured and efficient manner, it is essential to conduct a scientific examination of the multidimensional interconnection within the U-S-RTZ framework. By proposing a novel identification method of U-S-RTZ and taking Chengdu, China as a case study, grounded in a blender of natural and humanistic factors, this study quantitatively delineated and explored the spatial evolutions of U-S-RTZ and stated the optimization orientation and sustainable development strategies of the production-living-ecological spaces along the U-S-R gradients. The results show that: 1) it is suitable for the quantitative analysis of U-S-RTZ by established three-dimensional identification system in this study. 2) In 1990-2020, the urban-suburban transition zones (U-STZ) in Chengdu have continuously undergone a substantial increase, and the scale of the suburban-rural transition zones (S-RTZ) has continued to expand slightly, while the space of rural-ecological transition zones (R-ETZ) has noticeably compressed. 3) The landuse dynamics within U-S-RTZ has gradually increased in 1990-2020.

Row_222,"Background: As the world becomes increasingly urbanised, there is recognition that public and planetary health relies upon a ubiquitous transition to sustainable cities. Disentanglement of the complex pathways of urban design, environmental exposures, and health, and the magnitude of these associations, remains a challenge. A state-of-the-art account of large-scale urban health studies is required to shape future research priorities and equity- and evidence -informed policies. Objectives: The purpose of this review was to synthesise evidence from large-scale urban studies focused on the interaction between urban form, transport, environmental exposures, and health. This review sought to determine common methodologies applied, limitations, and future opportunities for improved research practice. Methods: Based on a literature search, 2958 articles were reviewed that covered three themes of: urban form; urban environmental health; and urban indicators. Studies were prioritised for inclusion that analysed at least 90 cities to ensure broad geographic representation and generalisability. Of the initially identified studies, following expert consultation and exclusion criteria, 66 were included. Results: The complexity of the urban ecosystem on health was evidenced from the context dependent effects of urban form variables on environmental exposures and health. Compact city designs were generally advantageous for reducing harmful environmental exposure and promoting health, with some exceptions. Methodological heterogeneity was indicative of key urban research challenges; notable limitations included exposure and health data at varied spatial scales and resolutions, limited availability of local -level sociodemographic data, and the lack of consensus on robust methodologies that encompass best research practice. Conclusion: Future urban environmental health research for evidence -informed urban planning and policies requires a multi -faceted approach. Advances in geospatial and AI -driven techniques and urban indicators offer promising developments; however, there remains a wider call for increased data availability at local -levels, transparent and robust methodologies of large-scale urban studies, and greater exploration of urban health vulnerabilities and inequities.","Dyer, Georgia M.

Row_223,"To improve real-time operation and management in urban rail transit (URT) systems, accurate and reliable short-term passenger flow forecasting at the network level is a crucial task. Although numerous endeavors have been devoted to this field, the insufficient topological representation for passenger flows in the URT network, the overlooking of intrinsic correlations among multi-source data, and the information loss in deep-learning frameworks are still critical issues that need to be addressed. This study proposes a multi-stage fusion passenger forecasting (MSFPF) model to accomplish short-term multi-step passenger forecasting leveraging multi-source data, and overcome the above-mentioned challenges. Based on the characteristics of passenger flows in the URT network, time-based origin-destination flow data is involved and utilized to enhance the representation of flows and provide spatial-temporal features. Then, the interaction and relationship among multi-source data are estimated to capture their intrinsic correlations. To effectively and comprehensively extract temporal and spatial features, a transformer long short-term memory block and a depth-wise attention block are constructed with attention mechanisms and employed. Furthermore, we construct the multi-stage fusion (MSF) structure to alleviate the information loss during the learning process, which is a significant component in improving the forecasting accuracy. In addition, the model is applied to two large-scale real-world datasets, in which it outperforms nine widely used baselines and four specific variants of itself. The quantitative experiments demonstrate the robustness and superiority of the proposed MSFPF model, and the significant contribution of the MSF structure in the model.","Chen, Yijie","Zhang, Jinlei","Lu, Yuan","Yang, Kuo","Liu, Hanxiao","Liang, Ying",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD,urban rail transit system,deep learning and advanced computing applications,short-term forecasting,spatial-temporal data mining,multi-source data fusion,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2024,Multi-Stage Fusion Framework for Short-Term Passenger Flow Forecasting in Urban Rail Transit Systems Using Multi-Source Data
Row_224,"Many cities seek to improve their urban forests to provide a diverse range of benefits for residents. One of these potential benefits, place attachment, is linked with its own positive outcomes including increased social cohesion, life satisfaction, and environmentally-friendly behaviour. However, it is currently unclear how urban forests relate to place attachment. This case study sought to clarify that relationship. A survey measuring residents' place attachment, satisfaction/dissatisfaction with urban forest services/disservices respectively, perceived urban forest characteristics, and sociodemographic variables was distributed to residents of the Perth Metropolitan Area in Western Australia. The survey measured these variables at three spatial scales: residents' homes, streets, and neighbourhoods. The 638 responses were combined with GIS datasets to calculate objective measures of average canopy cover. SEM was used to test relationships between different groups of variables and understand their relationship with place attachment. We found that place attachment was positively associated with residents' satisfaction with key urban forest services: sense of place, social interactions encouraged by the trees, and fresh air. In turn, place attachment and satisfaction with services were associated with objective canopy cover, both directly and indirectly via perceived characteristics. An analysis of qualitative feedback from residents helped to illustrate nuances around how urban trees relate to sense of place and how the loss of trees can be a source of distress and solastalgia. As such, we recommend that actual and perceived urban forest characteristics, residents' agency, and tree removal be adequately considered in efforts to maximise urban forest benefits.","McGrath, Harrison","Kurz, Tim","Veneklaas, Erik","Ramalho, Cristina E.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING,Perception,Sense of place,Solastalgia,Street trees,Structural equation modelling,,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 2024,Putting down roots: Relationships between urban forests and residents' place attachment
Row_225,"The intensification of urbanization (U_UR) in China exacerbates the pressure on the water environment (U_WE). The U_UR and U_WE exhibit incredibly intricate and intertwined interactions. The coordination between U_UR and U_WE is crucial for the sustainable development of cities. Hence, a comprehensive evaluation index system was developed to analyze the coupling coordination relationship and spatial effects between the U_UR and U_WE in China, based on the entropy weight method, the coupling coordination degree (CCD) model, and the spatial autocorrelation analysis method. The data was collected from the China Statistical Yearbook (2013-2023), the China Urban Construction Statistical Yearbook (2012-2022), and provincial statistical yearbooks. The results indicated that the overall trend of CCD in China showed an upward trajectory, increasing from 0.44 to 0.55 in 2012 to 0.56-0.66 in 2022. The average values of CCD for 31 provinces rose from 0.51 in 2012 to 0.61 in 2022, with a growth rate of 19.61%. The regional development level of CCD exhibited spatial heterogeneity, characterized by East > North > South > Northeast > Northwest > Southwest. However, the development of the U_WE subsystem lagged behind the U_UR subsystem, and there was a significant spatial imbalance in the CCD between the U_UR subsystem and U_WE subsystem in China from 2012 to 2022. The High-High Cluster areas of CCD were concentrated in the eastern part of China, while the Low-Low Cluster areas were concentrated in the western part.

Row_226,"Urban areas are increasingly vulnerable to sudden flooding disasters caused by intense rainfall and high imperviousness degree, resulting in great economic losses and human casualties. Interactions between rainfall data and urban catchment characteristics highlight the urgent need of accurate and effective precipitation data to apply in reliable hydrological simulations. However, it remains a challenge to obtain accurate rainfall datasets on such small scales in urban areas. As satellite remote sensing is the only method that can achieve global observation, it is important to evaluate satellite precipitation products in their ability to accurately capture intense precipitation on urban flood scales. This study evaluates the performance of the latest version 06B (V06B) Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) in North China Plain, with using the Radar-Gauge merged precipitation estimates as reference data. First, it could be concluded that IMERG fails to accurately estimate precipitation in the whole study area, having the problem of overestimating light precipitation and underestimating heavy precipitation. Second, results show that IMERG has poor ability to capture heavy precipitation on small scales, with the percentage of Hit nearly 0 and the percentage of Miss higher than 40 % for all the precipitation cases. Third, with the expansion of heavy precipitation centers' coverage, the problem of IMERG not to detect heavy precipitation gets mitigated, with the percentage of Miss decreasing by 14 % (19 %). However, the ability to capture both spatial location and precipitation intensity is still not good, the percentage of Hit ranging from 0.05 % to 7 %, without obvious improvement. When IMERG is able to capture the center of strong precipitation, it also tends to overestimate the weak precipitation around the center of strong precipitation. Results of this study provide an improved understanding of how well the V06B IMERG products capture the heavy precipitation center at small scales in urban areas, which will be useful for both developers and users of IMERG.","Xu, Jinyu","Qi, Youcun","Li, Donghuan","Zhao, Zhanfeng",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,Urban areas,Small spatial scales,Hourly precipitation,Heavy precipitation centers,Heavy precipitation centers,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 10 2024,Can IMERG QPE product capture the heavy rain on urban flood scale?
Row_227,"Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS) offer a new perspective for applying advanced information technology to improve urban transportation. However, real-world traffic datasets collected from sensing devices like loop sensors often contain corrupted or missing values. The incompleteness of traffic data poses great challenges to downstream data analysis tasks and applications. Most existing data-driven methods only impute missing values based on observed data or hypothetical models, thus ignoring the incorporation of social world information into traffic data imputation. The connection between real-world social activities and CPSS is crucial. In this paper, a novel theory-guided traffic data imputation framework, namely MissII, is proposed. In MissII, we first estimate the traffic flow between two PoIs (Points of Interest) according to spatial interaction theory by considering the physical environment information (e.g., population distributions) and human social interactions (e.g., destination choice game). Moreover, we further refine the estimated traffic flow by considering the effects of road interactions and PoIs. Then, the estimated traffic flow is input into the non-parametric GAN model as real samples to guide the training process. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world traffic dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.","Hou, Mingliang","Tang, Tao","Xia, Feng","Sultan, Ibrahim","Kaur, Roopdeep","Kong, Xiangjie",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TOPICS IN COMPUTING,Generative adversarial networks,Learning systems,Data models,Neural networks,Generators,Mobility models,Loss measurement,Cyber-Physical-Social systems,generative adversarial network,missing value imputation,spatial interaction theory,traffic data,,,,,JUL-SEP 2024,MissII: Missing Information Imputation for Traffic Data
Row_228,"Human disturbance is contributing to widespread, global changes in the distributions and densities of wild animals. These anthropogenic impacts on wildlife arise from multiple bottom-up and top-down pathways, including habitat loss, resource provisioning, climate change, pollution, infrastructure development, hunting and our direct presence. Animal behaviour is an important mechanism linking these disturbances to population outcomes, although these behavioural pathways are often complex and can remain obscured when different aspects of behaviour are studied in isolation from one another. The spatial-social interface provides a lens for understanding how an animal's spatial and social environments interact to determine its spatial and social phenotype (i.e. measurable characteristics of an individual), and how these phenotypes interact and feed back to reshape environments. Here, we review studies of animal behaviour at the spatial-social interface to understand and predict how human disturbance affects animal movement, distribution and intraspecific interactions, with consequences for the conservation of populations and ecosystems. By understanding the spatial-social mechanisms linking human disturbance to conservation outcomes, we can better design management interventions to mitigate undesired consequences of disturbance.This article is part of the theme issue 'The spatial-social interface: a theoretical and empirical integration'.","Gaynor, Kaitlyn M.","Abrahms, Briana","Manlove, Kezia R.","Oestreich, William K.","Smith, Justine A.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,anthropocene,human-wildlife conflict,landscape of fear,movement ecology,spatial-social interface,wildlife management,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 4 2024,Anthropogenic impacts at the interface of animal spatial and social behaviour
Row_229,"This paper theorizes the transformative potential of women's night-time leisure in Mumbai's urban areas. To this end, I draw on instances from qualitative field-based research focused on Mumbai's call centers and surrounding areas of informal urban activity. For women working night shifts in this sector, leisure activities occur with the help of informal vendors who run food stalls on streets around call centers. These times and space of leisure, I argue, disrupt capitalist and caste-based patriarchal systems. I analyze such leisure as a ""limen"" (cf. Lugones, 2003), a form of liminality that disrupts systems of production and reproduction that constitute the everyday (cf. Lefebvre, 1991). I elaborate on the temporal attributes of the limen to show how it goes against the grain of ""efficiency"" that otherwise shapes women's routines. The fluid spatial nature of women's night-time leisure helps rework dichotomous understandings of the public and private realm, demonstrating possibilities for intimate interactions within the public domain. The limen and intimate interactions therein often occur between food vendors and women working night shifts, revealing an intersubjective dynamic that ephemerally disrupts societal hierarchies. As such, the limen reworks and challenges existing structures, and in doing so, holds significance for envisioning a politics of change.","Parikh, Aparna",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,,ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING C-POLITICS AND SPACE,Urban leisure,gendered leisure,liminality,Maria Lugones,Henri Lefebvre,South Asia,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 2024,"Liminality of women's leisure in Mumbai, India"
Row_230,"The design of urban systems that allow growth while also maximising ecosystem services is identified as an important priority for creating a Good Anthropocene. An ecosystem service (ES)-based approach to landscape interventions maximises the provision of ESs, and in doing so, repairs and reinforces threatened ecological planetary boundaries. As an urbanising planet, cities are critical frontiers of human interaction with these planetary boundaries, and therefore a critical arena for ES-based intervention. Globally, the predominant pattern of urbanisation is dedensification, an outwardly expanding trend where cities are growing in physical extent at a higher rate than their population growth. We therefore require spatially explicit tools capable of reconciling dedensification and Good Anthropocene visions. We propose a methodology that integrates agroecology and urbanisation and is focussed specifically on the supply of targeted regulating ESs. This 'Agroecology for the City' differs from conventional urban agriculture discourse and its preoccupation with food security. Our research interest is agroecological farm systems' (AFSs) capacity to provide critical life support services in a spatially effective manner to urban systems. Our recent research introduced a new GIS-based model (ESMAX) and a spatial agroecology approach that identified AFS configurations at a 1 ha scale which maximised the supply of three regulating ESs, as well as multifunctional performance across all three ESs combined. In the present research, we apply this process at a larger scale, with 1 ha and 4 ha AFS parcels being integrated with a real-world 200 ha peri-urban residential development. The AFS parcels and built-up areas are configured differently to maximise the supply of ESs identified as critical by the local community. We found that arrangements with AFS parcels interspersed evenly with built-up areas provided the best multifunctionality across the four ESs tested. This supports pathways for a Good Anthropocene that work with the global urbanising reality of dedensification and underpin the need for a hybrid science of rural/urban systems.","Morris, Richard","Davis, Shannon","Grelet, Gwen-Aelle","Gregorini, Pablo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,LAND,dedensification,ecosystem services,GIS,urban agroecology,adaptive management,spatial design,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,Agroecology for the City-Spatialising ES-Based Design in Peri-Urban Contexts

In addition, Urban public spaces play a pivotal role in shaping societies' dynamics and can significantly affect conflict and peacebuilding initiatives. In a context marked by Conflict's profound impact, this article aims to contribute to the knowledge base for informed urban interventions that foster positive interactions and reconciliation in post -conflict cities. The article seeks to explore the intricate relationship between urban spaces and their influence on war or to promote sustainable peacebuilding through investigating the various roles of the urban public spaces during the war and peacetimes via residents' experiences of the diverse spaces' functions that shaped the city's status quo. In addition, considering the interplay of social dynamics, conflict history, and the mental spatial map of cities in public urban spaces can influence lasting peace or upcoming conflicts. This article focuses on Aleppo as a case study, understanding the positive and negative experiences from the residents' perspective before and during the current war in Syria, and even distinguishes between two periods during the recent war, which are the active violence and after the end of the direct active violence, where it could inform the decision -makers and urban planners on the areas of focus while developing post-war urban public spaces to ensure its positive role in fostering peace and be able to deal with the social dynamic and the mental spatial map that developed along with the conflict history. The paper utilised a mixed -methods approach, encompassing a case study review of Aleppo City from an urban perspective and fieldwork involving focus group discussions and semi -structured interviews with Aleppian from different backgrounds and geographic areas that represent the social dynamic of the city, as well as approached Aleppian who are still in living in the city and those who flee out of it to ensure the coverage of different political direction in addition field work engaged with academia and technical from the city who shared their knowledge and experiences working in the city. Participants were prompted to reflect on their pre-war familiarity with public places and share their experiences. These experiences were categorized by enabling a comprehensive understanding of how conflict context influenced these spaces. The article results offer an understanding of the peace -guiding functions of the urban public spaces based on the city residents' experiences that could inform architects and urban planners in designing spaces conducive to sustainable peacebuilding.

Row_232,"Buildings and roads are the two most basic man-made environments that carry and interconnect human society. Building and road information has important application value in the frontier fields of regional coordinated development, disaster prevention, and auto-driving. Mapping buildings and roads from very high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images has become a hot research topic. However, the existing methods often extract buildings and roads with separate models, ignoring their strong spatial correlation. To fully utilize their complementary relation, we propose a method that simultaneously extracts buildings and roads from remote sensing images. The accuracy of both tasks can be improved using our proposed multitask feature interaction (MFI) and cross-scale feature interaction modules. To be specific, a multitask interaction (MTI) module is proposed to interact information across building extraction and road extraction tasks while preserving the unique information of each task. Furthermore, a cross-scale interaction (CSI) module is designed to automatically learn the optimal reception field for buildings and roads under varied appearances and structures. Compared with existing methods that train individual models for each task separately, the proposed collaborative extraction method can utilize the complementary advantages between buildings and roads and reduce the inference time by half using a single model. Experiments on a wide range of urban and rural scenarios show that the proposed algorithm can achieve building-road extraction with outstanding performance and efficiency.","Guo, Haonan","Su, Xin","Wu, Chen","Du, Bo","Zhang, Liangpei",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING,Roads,Buildings,Feature extraction,Task analysis,Data mining,Remote sensing,Correlation,Building extraction,deep learning,multitask learning,road segmentation,,,,,,2024,Building-Road Collaborative Extraction From Remote Sensing Images via Cross-Task and Cross-Scale Interaction

Row_234,"Spatial-temporal data mining for traffic flow regulation remains a challenging task due to the complex spatiotemporal correlation and the non-Euclidean nature of traffic data. Existing approaches typically utilize a provided spatial adjacency graph and sophisticated mechanisms for modeling spatial and temporal correlations. However, the static representation of a given spatial adjacency graph may restrict effective spatial-temporal dependency learning and fail to capture dynamic interactions over time. To address those challenges, our paper proposes the Dynamic Adaptive Graph Convolution Network (DAGCN), a highly optimized model with a low memory footprint. DAGCN can effectively learn hidden spatial dependencies by utilizing a novel graph convolution layer with adaptive parameter update mechanisms and innovative attention computations. Additionally, DAGCN could overcome the limitations of static data dependencies by employing the dynamic graph modulation approach. This approach combines the assumption of static adjacency matrices with dynamic feature generation based on the multi-head attention mechanism. Meanwhile, by integrating this module with a novel temporal module, DAGCN could gather information in the temporal domain.

Row_235,"Urban periphery watersheds play a crucial role in providing diverse ecosystem services, especially hydrological services (HES), for society at different temporal and spatial scales; moreover, local populations directly influence ecosystem functionality through their decisions and actions. The interactions between social and ecological factors create social-ecological systems (SESs), whose trajectories continuously change in response to internal factors such as land use cover change (LUCC) and external factors such as climate change (CC). This situation influences the vulnerability of SESs in terms of exposure, sensitivity and adaptation capacity. In this study, the social-ecological vulnerability (SEV) of the periphery of Mexico City was investigated based on the Collaborative Protocol for Ecosystem Services Assessment and Social-ecological Vulnerability Mapping (ECOSER) and a quantitative method approach. For this purpose, spatial analysis was performed using the ecological and social spatial data for LUCC tendencies calculated for 1999-2019 and projected for short-term CC scenarios and using LUCC calculated for 2039 in trend-based (TREND) and restrictive (REST) scenarios. The results reveal that increases in the SEV in 2039 will be related to important decreases in the HES; furthermore, the REST scenario suggests decreases in the SEV due to decreases in the HES, assuming that environmental public policy instruments will be preserved in this region.

Consequently, this paper utilized the Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) data from Shanghai, China, to investigate whether there is a spatial trade-off in the health effects of green spaces on people 's inactivity. Our findings confirmed the trade-off effects of green spaces in reducing sedentary time, using interaction terms to highlight how the health impacts of green spaces vary across different population densities and may thus lead to inconsistent relationships between green space and health outcomes. Generally, the ability of green spaces to affect sedentary time decreased as population density increases, particularly regarding park proximity and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Our research also revealed that the trade-off in health benefits from green spaces was influenced by the type of green space. For instance, park proximity, park area, and NDVI showed trade-off effects, with higher population densities enhancing the impact of NDVI on increasing sedentary time ( beta = 133.871), despite NDVI itself decreasing with a rise in population density (r =-0.68). Conversely, the Green Vegetation Index (GVI) did not demonstrate such an effect. The unequal spatial distribution and composition of green space may further exacerbate health inequities. Therefore, this paper recommends that future provisioning of green spaces should take into account the local urban spatial structure.","Miao, Siyu","Xiao, Yang",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,Health effect,Green space,Trade-off,Sedentariness,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2024,Exploring the spatial trade-off effects of green space on older people's physical inactivity: Evidence from Shanghai

However, there are different aerosol category settings and identifying parameter selections among different aerosol identification methods, which causes incoherence in data comparisons and uncertainty in quantifying thier climate and environment effects. To bridge the gap, this study establishes spatial correlations and aerosol type conversion relationships among four commonly -used aerosol identification methods, which includes AOD-AE, AE -SSA, FMF-SSA, and SAE-AAE. Aerosol optical properties observed at 37 typical AERONET sites are selected as the testbed, including marine, desert dust, clean continent, urban industry, and biomass burning sites. Results show that marine and desert dust aerosols are the most effectively identified types, while urban industry and biomass burning aerosols overlap much in the identification spaces since they contain similar chemical components. Dust and marine aerosol generally have the best agreement among the four identification methods, because desert dust and marine particles have distinctive chemical components from other kinds, thus the category setting from the perspective of emission source, light absorbing ability, or chemical components has less influence on the identification results. Spatial correlation between the four commonly -used aerosol identification methods futher refines the correspondence of aerosol category, light absorption capacity, and chemical components. And we find that uncertain aerosols defined in FMF-SSA are mostly marine aerosols.","Chen, Qi-Xiang","Huang, Chun Lin","Dong, Shi-Kui","Lin, Kai-Feng",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH,Aerosol,Type identification,AERONET,Spatial correlation,Conversion relationship,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 1 2024,Bridging the Gap: Establishing Spatial Correlations and Type Conversion Relationships among Different Aerosol Idetification Methods
Row_238,"Theoretical developments are needed to interpret the increasing amount of large-scale spatial data about past settlements. So far, settlement patterns have mostly been considered as passive imprints of past human activities and most theories are limited to ecological processes. Locational and spatial interactions have scarcely been included as long-term driving forces of settlement systems but hold promise to explain large-scale patterns. This paper proposes a conceptual model for long-term spatial adaptive settlement systems based on the complex adaptive systems framework and both spatial and cross -scale interactions. The goal of the model is to find new ways of interpreting archaeological location data and understand settlement systems as emerging from microchoices of population units interacting in space. The conceptualisation is carried out on a level that it can be used to bridge hunter -gatherer and urban theories. We first describe settlement patterns based on concepts from archaeological locational studies and socialecological systems. Second, we identify the abstract spatial and aspatial entities of the system and describe the potential relations between them. Using knowledge from previous research, we then map both empirically observable and abstract system entities and predict links between them in order to come up with an overarching conceptual framework. The system is based on residential choice mechanisms and exposes several crossscale feedback loops between the micro -level choices and the settlement system emerging at the meso-level. We finally argue that the proposed adaptive settlement system framework has the potential to bring new insights into long-term processes, especially through dynamic spatial simulation, and at the same time, provides an interpretational framework for archaeological records and empirical spatial analysis. Examples of its applications in archaeological research are introduced.","Sikk, Kaarel","Caruso, Geoffrey",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,Settlement systems,Complex adaptive systems,Locational modelling,Residential location choice,Social -ecological systems,Complexity,,,,,,,,,,,APR 2024,Framing settlement systems as spatial adaptive systems

However, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of the noise pattern and, therefore, effective mitigation strategies. To control the noise in urban rail transit systems, this study proposes a comprehensive noise assessment framework, including metrics such as average sound pressure level, peak sound pressure level, percentile sound pressure levels, dynamic range, main frequency component, and cumulative time energy to evaluate the noise characteristics. We also employ a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) method to identify the noise patterns with the evaluation of their hazard to urban rail transit drivers.

This paper reflects on a community-engaged housing studio approach and a subsequent design and build co-creation workshop at the Department of Architecture, University of Cyprus (UCY), for the design and development of a public space in a suburban neighbourhood in Nicosia. The housing studio incorporates principles of inclusivity and sustainability aiming to create the conditions for an integrated framework for achieving sustainable urban governance and to initiate a community of practice, fostering a participatory process. Drawing from the tools and methods of live studios and Urban Living Labs, this transdisciplinary process involves all participants at various levels and stages through a circular methodology of assessing and understanding, co-creating, co-designing and implementing and co-evaluating. Reflecting on the outcomes, the paper discusses the opportunities and limitations of a community-engaged design methodology through future graduates' exposure to real world contingencies and interaction with diverse stakeholders, while empowering citizens as decision makers who have a responsibility for their residential environment.","Charalamboush, Nadia","Panayi, Christina","Roussou, Effrosyni",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,"TOWARDS A NEW EUROPEAN BAUHAUS-CHALLENGES IN DESIGN EDUCATION, EAAE 2022",,Co-creation,Community engagement,Teaching and learning practices,Design studio,Transdisciplinarity,Sustainable urban governance,Spatial agency,,,,,,,,,,2024,Co-creating Urban Commons Through Community-Engaged Pedagogies
Row_241,"Urban habitats are rapidly changing, making the conservation and management of species adapted to these environments challenging. Nest site selection is a pivotal point in the process of habitat selection and breeding for bird species. We measured 10 structural and spatial characteristics at 32 nest presence sites and 64 randomly selected nest absence sites of Laughing Doves (Spilopelia senegalensis) in an urban environment in Karaj, Iran. To model the nest site selection, we performed spline binary logistic regression. Two variables significantly influenced the nest site selection of Laughing Doves: nest height above ground, with an optimal range of similar to 286-347 cm, and nest concealment, favoring invisible places from the front and sides. Distance to opposite building, with an optimal range of similar to 16-34 m, was marginally significant. Additionally, we surveyed the feasibility of occupying artificial nestboxes (n = 17) by Laughing Doves between February and September 2019. The occupancy rate of the artificial nestboxes was similar to 35%. Overall, these results suggest that despite the relatively high structural heterogeneity of our urban environment, Laughing Doves exhibit distinct preferences for certain nest site characteristics, which may reflect a dependence on close proximity to humans for safety and access to food and water.","Banisaffar, Morteza","Shabani, Afshin Alizadeh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,ORNIS HUNGARICA,human-animal interaction,nestbox,nest site preferences,spline,urban bird behavior,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 1 2024,"Factors influencing nest site selection of the Laughing Dove (Spilopelia senegalensis) in an urban area in Karaj, Iran"
Row_242,"Automatic urban informal settlement (UIS) extraction based on high-resolution remote sensing image (HRI) is of great significance for urban planning and management. This study proposes a scene classification-assisted and texture feature-enhanced multiscale network (STMNet) for UIS extraction. First, STMNet takes HRI and computed handcrafted texture feature (HTF) as input. Second, it employs a pseudo-siamese network to extract multidimensional deep features from HRI and HTF, respectively. In addition, a feature attention fusion module is constructed to fuse the aforementioned features. Finally, skip connection and feature decoder are utilized to obtain UIS extraction results. In detail, considering the sparse and dispersed distribution of UIS, a scene information aggregation and classification module is constructed to determine whether the input image patch contains UIS. For the characteristics of high spatial heterogeneity and various shapes and scales of UIS, an improved atrous spatial pyramid pooling is presented to extract multiscale and multireceptive field features. An edge loss function is applied during network training to minimize errors in the edge regions of UIS. The effectiveness of STMNet is tested on a self-produced UIS extraction dataset and the publicly available UIS-Shenzhen dataset. Quantitative results demonstrate that STMNet achieved the best performance in terms of fa, F-1, and IoU. The mr is slightly higher than that of MAResU-Net and UisNet. In addition, STMNet achieved the best visual interpretation results and the fastest inference speed on the self-produced UIS extraction dataset.","Du, Shouhang","Xing, Jianghe","Wang, Shaoyu","Wei, Liguang","Zhang, Yirui",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING,Feature extraction,Data mining,Human-robot interaction,Scene classification,Machine learning algorithms,Accuracy,Planning,Handcrafted texture feature (HTF),high-resolution remote sensing image (HRI),scene classification,semantic segmentation,urban informal settlement (UIS),,,,,2024,STMNet: Scene Classification-Assisted and Texture Feature-Enhanced Multiscale Network for Large-Scale Urban Informal Settlement Extraction From Remote Sensing Images

This research delves into the linguistic composition of commercial signage within Bangkok's urban fabric, focusing on the linguistic and semiotic landscape of public commercial spaces. It investigates the organization and narration of the societal affects surrounding Chinese New Year culture, thereby shaping the city's ethos. The famous Chinese community (Yaowarat Road Chinatown) and renowned commercial hub (Siam commercial district) in Bangkok contributed a total of 236 images depicting Chinese New Year cultural symbols for this study. By employing theories of nexus analysis and place semiotics comprehensively, this research elucidates how linguistic practices within the Chinese New Year festive landscape engender and influence urban affects. The findings underscore that commercial districts, as pivotal agents, craft the urban portrayal of Chinese New Year culture through linguistic and semiotic landscapes, offering residents and tourists alike an affective voyage through exotic customs and New Year traditions. The carriers, emplacement and inscriptions of spatial discourses reflect the attitudes and philosophies of landscape planners who advocate for New Year cultural customs. Furthermore, the interaction order within the landscapes reflects both explicit New Year interactive activities and implicit New Year semiotic artifacts, collectively contributing to the construction of the urban narrative steeped in New Year's cultural essence.

The papers in this special issue analyse key issues of the digital turn in urban studies, focusing on the pre-eminence of platforms in the tourism-led economic and social restructuring of our cities.This 'big platformisation of cities' has generated changes in urban lifestyles, consumption patterns and forms of capital accumulation, impacting on trade relations, forms of mobility and labor market shifts in the city. Therefore, theoretical concepts such as 'platform economy', 'platform capitalism' or 'platform urbanism' are being used to explain current shifts in the dynamics of urban capital accumulation, leaving behind innocuous ones such as 'collaborative economy' or 'smart city'. Such conceptual twists reflect the analytical relevance of platform-mediated labor and the mechanisms of surplus value extraction from platforms to fully unveil the spatial and social transformations in the city. Specifically, the papers of this special issue follow three fundamental themes: the role of digital platforms in the itinerant lifes of urban dwellers, the dynamics of tourism rentierism in the platform age, and the precariousness of labour in digital capitalism.

The results showed that the influence of urban activities on bacterial community structure in sediment was greater than that in water. The input of pollution in different regions changed the diversity and abundance of water and sediments bacteria and promoted bacterial community reconstruction to a certain extent.

Analyzed synergistic degrees between ER and GEE and regional differences by the modified coupled coordination model and Dagum's Gini coefficient. Results indicated that ER overall showed an increase from 2003 to 2021. GEE exhibited a slanting 'W' shaped trend but remained generally upward. In addition, the synergistic degree between ER and GEE increased, indicating beneficial interactions and a trend of synergistic evolution moving towards advancement. Spatial differences in synergistic degree were mainly due to hypervariable density, with inter -regional variations as a secondary factor. The Pearl River Delta (PRD) showed the highest intra-regional variation in synergistic degree and the Chengdu -Chongqing region (CC) the least. The synergistic gap between CC and PRD was the largest, while the gap between CC and the middle reaches of the Yangtze River (MYR) was the smallest.

However, due to the significant correlation between the influence of pollution sources on cancer and the distance between them, and the influence of pollution sources by weather, emission concentration, and other factors is different, there are still some challenges in spatial ordered-pair pattern mining. In this paper, we design an online system MIPC-SHOPs for mining the influence of industrial pollution on cancer based on spatial high-influence ordered-pair patterns. Unlike previous works, first, a new influence measure based on Gaussian kernel density estimation is proposed in MIPC-SHOPs, which solves the problem that the influence of pollution sources on cancer cases decays with distance. Second, to restore the diffusion influence of pollution sources in the real world as much as possible, the urban wind direction, wind speed, and pollution emission concentration were considered to set a new spatial neighbor relationship measurement criterion. Considering the different carcinogenic levels of the pollution sources, a weighted method is proposed to calculate the influence of pollutant on cancer.

Row_248,"Change detection (CD) in remote sensing imagery is a crucial task with applications in environmental monitoring, urban development, and disaster management. CD involves utilizing bitemporal images to identify changes over time. The bitemporal spatial relationships between features at the same location at different times play a key role in this process. However, existing change detection networks often do not fully leverage these spatial relationships during bitemporal feature extraction and fusion. In this work, we propose SRC-Net: a bitemporal spatial relationship concerned network for CD. The proposed SRC-Net includes a perception and interaction module that incorporates spatial relationships and establishes a cross-branch perception mechanism to enhance the precision and robustness of feature extraction. In addition, a patch-mode joint feature fusion module is introduced to address information loss in current methods. It considers different change modes and concerns about spatial relationships, resulting in more expressive fusion features. Furthermore, we construct a novel network using these two relationship concerned modules and conducted experiments on the LEVIR-CD and WHU Building datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our network outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining a modest parameter count.

Row_249,"Innovation districts can spur urban economic growth but present challenges like socio-spatial segregation. To mitigate segregation, we emphasize the importance of ""staying activities"" such as sitting, playing, and relaxing, over transient activities like walking or cycling in the design of public spaces. Focused on One-north, an innovation district in Singapore, we examine how different spatial qualities influence the ""staying activities"" of diverse socioeconomic groups. Using a GeoAI workflow that integrates various data-sources with machine learning and AI, we assess thirteen spatial quality indicators and their impact on staying activities. Our deep neural network (DNN) model, which achieves an 83.74% accuracy rate, confirms the effectiveness of these indicators in capturing the co-location of staying activities between diverse income groups in One-north. Our findings reveal that typical markers of well-designed public spaces, such as visual diversity and greenery, do not consistently enhance staying activities. Their effectiveness varies across One-north and is shaped by the unique functional contexts and land-use types of each sector in the district. Our research thus highlights the necessity for context-specific designs that encourage meaningful social interactions and reduce socioeconomic segregation.

Much of the research that does address social processes focuses primarily on their effects on biotic community composition, with less attention paid to how social processes affect species interactions. Linking social processes to ecological outcomes is complicated by high spatial heterogeneity in cities and the potential for scale mismatch between social and ecological processes, and the indicators used to assess those processes. Here, we assessed how social and ecological processes jointly influence the frequency and outcomes of species interactions among the native perennial vine Gelsemium sempervirens and its insect pollinators, nectar robbers, and florivores across 28 residential subdivisions in the Research Triangle region, NC, USA. We integrated data on socioeconomic attributes (mean property value, mean property size, subdivision age), vegetation attributes (forest cover and richness and density of managed and unmanaged floral resources), species interactions (conspecific and heterospecific pollen deposition, nectar robbing, florivory), and Gelsemium reproduction (fruit set, seeds per fruit) using structural equation modeling to understand the causal links between socioeconomic attributes, vegetation attributes, and interaction frequency and outcome. Among socioeconomic attributes, property value was the strongest predictor of interaction frequency, having both direct and vegetation-mediated indirect effects on pollination and florivory. However, the effect of socioeconomic attributes on plant reproduction was small. Overall, we were able to explain only a small amount of the variation in any species interaction or reproduction measure. This may be due to the functional similarity of subdivisions, despite large variation in both socioeconomic and vegetation attributes, or may reflect scale mismatch between the ecological and socioeconomic variables. Our findings highlight the need to develop scale-appropriate indicators to improve our understanding of the links between social and ecological processes in urban landscapes.","Fitch, Gordon","Adler, Lynn S.","Irwin, Rebecca E.","Warren, Paige S.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,PLOS ONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 15 2024,Socioecological drivers of mutualistic and antagonistic plant-insect interactions and interaction outcomes in suburban landscapes
Row_251,"Accelerated urbanization and development in disaster-prone areas have prompted urban authorities to adopt adaptation strategies to improve resilience and vulnerability to climate change and related disasters. Therefore, assessing resilience, vulnerability and their evolution over time becomes crucial in comprehending the dynamics of interactions between resilience, vulnerability, adaptive capacity, and urban spatial changes. Using an empirical study in Taipei Metropolis, Taiwan, we developed a Framework for Metropolitan Resilience-Vulnerability-Adaptation Assessments. This framework integrated spatial statistics with multicriteria decision-making analyses to assess overall resilience and capacities to tackle climate-related disaster risks, as well as their dynamics between the years 2001 and 2016. Our approach further employed resilience and vulnerability change models to explore the connections between adaptive capacities and improvements in resilience and vulnerability over time. Results indicate that low-resilience and high-vulnerability areas are significantly clustered and continue to deteriorate, particularly in fast-growing peri-urban and old-downtown communities. Moreover, comparing the effects of adaptive factors shows that increasing investments in transportation networks, public lands, and infrastructure does not lead to the improvements in resilience and vulnerability in the long-term. This implies that conflicts and trade-offs may exist between certain adaptation options and resilience building efforts. Numerous disaster-proof, public facilities and emergency responses may simply provide short-term benefits and potentially lead to maladaptive outcomes. They create a way to encourage large-scale land development and urban space changes, thereby locking in adaptation pathways focused on short-term resilience improvement, while strengthening the vulnerability loops in the long-term. Our findings provide metropolitan governors and stakeholders valuable insights into formulating more effective adaptive policies that reconcile resilience and vulnerability.

The Mid-Yangtze River urban agglomeration (MYRUA), which is an important region for China, also faces the contradiction of balancing environmental protection and economic production. Currently, there is little discussion on low-carbon pollution research in the MYRUA in China. Therefore, this study takes the MYRUA as the research object, uses a slack-based model (SBM) and exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) to explore the spatiotemporal evolution of the industrial carbon emission efficiency (ICEE) of the MYRUA in China from 2006 to 2019, and empirically analyses the factors influencing the ICEE based on a spatial econometric model. The results show that (1) in the period 2006 - 2019, the ICEE in the MYRUA region generally exhibited a "" jagged "" trend of decreasing, then increasing until finally decreasing again. Spatially, ICEE generally exhibited a dynamic trend of being low throughout, with high -efficiency areas tending to move to the center and low-efficiency areas being scattered. (2) The global Moran ' s I coefficient for ICEE ranged between 0.002 and 0.213, with the highest Moran ' s I value and significant spatial correlation occurring in 2006, after which the value gradually decreased. On the local autocorrelation, the ICEE in 2006 exhibited an agglomeration effect and weakened after 2010. (3) In 2019, the level of industrialization (LI) and the level of external openness (LEO) in the MYRUA changed from nonsignificant to significant positive correlations, and the LEO had the largest impact. The energy consumption structure (ECS) was always significantly negatively correlated. The levels of social development (LSD) and environmental regulation (ER) changed from showing a significant positive correlation to showing a nonsignificant correlation. In conclusion, ICEE is affected by interactions of multiple factors. In the future, the ECS of the MYRUA should be continuously optimized and replaced by clean energy.

Row_254,"Accurate detection of changes in buildings is crucial for the understanding of urban development. The growing accessibility of remote sensing imagery has enabled urban scale change detection (CD) in both 2D and 3D. However, existing methods have not yet fully exploited the fusion of feature information in multi-temporal images, resulting in insufficient accuracy in 2D changed regions or in elevation changes. To this end, a Cross-temporal and Spatial Context Learning Network (CSCLNet) aimed at multi-task building CD from dual- temporal optical images is proposed, capturing both 2D and 3D changes simultaneously. It leverages a CNN network to extract multi-layer semantic features. Subsequently, two modules, Cross-temporal Transformer Semantic Enhancement (CTSE) and Multi-layer Feature Fusion (MFF), are developed to refine the feature representations. CTSE enhances temporal information by cross attention of dual-temporal features to enable interactions and MFF fuses multi-layer features and enhances attention to global and local spatial context. Finally, two prediction heads are introduced to separately handle 2D and 3D change prediction, identifying changed building objects and their elevation changes. Experiments conducted with two public datasets, 3DCD and SMARS, show that the CSCLNet achieves state-of-the-art for both 2D and 3D CD tasks.

Urbanization had a significant negative correlation with the supply of recreation, aesthetic, education and social interaction but had a significant positive correlation with the supply of cultural heritage. The demands of recreation and social interaction were significantly lower in areas with moderate urbanization level. In these areas, CESs were dominated by high supply-low demand and low-degree matches, whereas residents' SWB was lower.ConclusionsThe variations of the CES-SWB relationship in our study indicate the development trajectory of social-ecological systems in the context of urbanization.

Row_257,"A fundamental aspect of ensuring urban sustainability is a comprehensive understanding of the driving mechanisms behind the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the spatiotemporal variations and underlying mechanisms of the surface urban heat island (SUHI) in Hefei. The study employed the local climate zone (LCZ) method to analyze land surface morphology and spatial structure for 2014 and 2021. Subsequently, calculations were conducted to derive surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), gravity water index (GWI), building surface fraction (BSF), road density (RD), poi density (PD), and population density (PPD). The exploration of the mechanisms by which factors influence SUHI was conducted by utilizing both Pearson correlation analysis and geographic detector models. The results revealed that sparsely built (LCZ 9) and low plants (LCZ D) predominantly characterized built-up and natural coverage areas, respectively. The summer season was distinguished by the most extensive SUHI distribution and the highest SUHII levels. Significantly, SUHII consistently exceeded those of built-up LCZs when contrasted to natural LCZs. Large lowrise (LCZ 8) consistently displayed the highest SUHII levels, whereas water (LCZ G) consistently exhibited the lowest SUHII values. NDBI took precedence and showed a positive correlation with SUHI. Among the socio-economic factors, building height (BH) demonstrated a superior explanatory capability for SUHI compared to other variables. The interaction between NDBI and NDVI maximized the explanation of SUHI under different seasons. The findings of this study will serve as critical insights for urban planners and policymakers, enabling the development of scientifically-based and efficacious strategies to mitigate SUHI.","Xi, Yantao","Wang, Shuangqiao","Zou, Yunxia","Zhou, Xingchi","Zhang, Yuanfan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13,,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,Local climate zone,LCZ generator,Surface urban heat island,Spatiotemporal variations,Geographical detector,Hefei,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 2024,Seasonal surface urban heat island analysis based on local climate zones

However, few studies have examined the spatial structures within bus travel and the associated factors across different geographic areas, which may overlook the underlying travel patterns and characteristics within these communities.

Then we detect travel communities using Leiden algorithm and further investigate the determinants for bus flows across different communities based on Poisson regression models. The findings indicate that older adults have a shorter peak interval, more localized activity spaces, lower network connectivity, and weaker interaction strength, suggesting limited mobility in bus travel compared to younger adults. The study highlights that travel duration and land use mix are important predictors for both groups regardless of geographic areas, and there are also differences in the factors influencing bus travel across various regional communities.

This study develops an innovative multi-scale modeling framework combining the coupled mesoscale and microscale numerical models with unmanned aerial vehicle photography to accurately capture the microclimate dynamics of highly fragmented real urban climates under mesoscale weather conditions. Validated by measured data, this framework is adopted to simulate the dynamic meteorology during the heatwave in the Xiongan New Area in Hebei Province, China. Results reveal that the high-density built-up area(HDA) exhibits spatial patterns of higher temperatures, poorer ventilation, more arid, and more severe heat stress than near-river and low-density areas. Moreover, HDA tends to convert more radiation energy into ground heat storage(QS) Q S ) and sensible heat flux(QH) Q H ) during daytime, and QS S is subsequently released into QH H at night, thus deteriorating the nighttime thermal environment. Whereas, the river converts more radiation energy into Q S , with a portion transformed into latent heat flux, which benefits summer cooling. This innovative framework provides promising tools for sustainable urban climate design in realistic cities.","Hang, Jian","Xu, Yuepeng","Hua, Jiajia","Wang, Weiwen","Zhao, Bo","Zeng, Liyue","Du, Yaxing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY,Multi-scale model,Unmanned aerial vehicle photography,Extreme heat waves,Urban micro-meteorology,Thermal stress,Energy balance,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 15 2024,"A framework combining multi-scale model and unmanned aerial vehicle for investigating urban micro-meteorology, thermal comfort, and energy balance"
Row_261,"Hydromorphodynamic interactions with vegetation are a part of fluvial biomorphodynamics in actively meandering rivers. Using palynofacies and grain size from sub -urban to urban reaches across the river valley, the spatial patterns of organic matter behavior are examined in a 38 km reach of the Gomati River in Lucknow District, Uttar Pradesh, India. This is done to understand how they respond to the alteration, preservation, and degradation after getting transported and deposited in sediment. Thirteen surface sediment samples of the Gomati River floodplain were analyzed for palynofacies and grain size to ascertain its fate in this reach, which comprises the big picture for past human settlement. The shifts in the proportions of palynofacies associations, i.e., phytoclasts, palynomorphs, and amorphous organic matter (AOM) along with grain size, are considered to visualize the depositional process. The CONISS cluster analysis revealed four zones reflecting high degradation and alteration of palynofacies in the urban regime compared to the sub -urban reaches where the low interference with natural settings illustrates the low deterioration of palynofacies. The relation between grain size and palynofacies was obtained using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to emphasize the correlation with palynofacies in the meandering fluvial system of the Gomati River. In the floodplain deposits, the behavior of palynofacies, allows for the distinction of the regional aspects of fluvial sediment disposition. The current study compares urban and sub -urban settlement premises of today's communities and contributes to the understanding of the growth, dispersal, and decline of earlier human settlements.

Row_262,"The atmospheric boundary layer along the coastal-urban transect differs from that of urban or rural regions due to the distinctive interaction between the sea breeze and the urban heat island effect. In this manuscript, we present the observations of the atmospheric boundary layer in the Houston, Texas, area during the Coastal Urban Boundary Layer Experiment (CUBE) from June through September 2022. In order to understand the unique characteristics of the coastal urban boundary layer, we collected mean and turbulence data from micrometeorological towers and ground-based remote sensing instruments installed in the urban, coastal, bay, and rural sections within the greater Houston region. Furthermore, an urbanized weather research and forecast (WRF) model incorporating the Building Effect Parameterization and Building Energy Model (BEP-BEM) scheme is used to recognize the spatial variability of the meteorological conditions in the Houston Metro area. Compared to non-urban sites, the urban site exhibits a higher near-surface temperature throughout the day, with the highest temperature difference occurring at night due to the redistribution of the stored heat as sensible heat. During the dry period in June, we observed comparatively higher sensible heat flux in the urban site, demonstrating the heat island effect and lower latent heat flux due to lack of vegetation. The urban site had higher TKE values throughout the day than other sites because of the uneven roughness of the landscape. One of the unique findings of this study is the shift in spectral characteristics along the coastal-rural-urban transect. The power and co-spectra of zonal and vertical velocities and the vertical heat flux during the convective periods varied significantly across all the sites. The coastal site was influenced mainly by the local bay breeze shifting the peak to higher frequencies. The boundary layer height in the urban site was generally greater than in bay and rural sites due to increased convection in urban areas resulting from anthropogenic modification of land cover and waste heat from air conditioning use. The balance between the urban thermal and mechanical roughness effects was seen during the sea breeze front (SBF) event on the highest heat index day as SBF was triggered and accelerated by UHI.","Rahman, Kalimur","Rios, Gabriel","Gamarro, Harold","Addasi, Omar","Pena, Jean Carlos","Gonzalez-Cruz, Jorge","Bornstein, Robert","Ramamurthy, Prathap",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2024,The boundary layer characteristics of coastal urban environments
Row_263,"The issue of energy consumption is receiving increasing attention due to the growth of the global population and urbanization rate. This study comprehensively analyzed the independent effects, spatial varying effects, and interactive effects of potential factors on summer electricity consumption (EC) by using the geographical detector and geographically weighted regression model. Finally, the study area was partitioned into clusters based on the GWR local coefficients to provide zonal customized policy implications. Results found that floor area ratio (FAR) was the key factor that influenced EC. As for independent effects, FAR independently explained 36.3% of the variance of the EC. As for spatial varying effects, the association between FAR and EC was found to be spatially non-stationary. This association was positive in high FAR regions and vice versa in low FAR regions. As for interaction effects, FAR boolean AND land surface temperature was identified as the factor pair with the highest interactive explanatory power. Finally, the study area was divided into four clusters, and customized policy implications were proposed based on the local relationship between EC and factors. This study provides a new perspective for understanding urban energy consumption, which will contribute to sustainable development and energy consumption management.","Gao, Feng","Jiao, Zhenzhi","Liao, Shunyi","Liu, Rui","Hu, Zhisai","Liu, Yang","Li, Hongbao","Chen, Wangyang","Chen, Xin","Li, Guanyao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,APPLIED GEOGRAPHY,Energy consumption,Electricity consumption,Driving factors,GeoDetector,GWR,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 2024,Summer electricity consumption and its drivers in urban areas

Learning GPS trajectory representation to characterize a driver's driving style is a challenging task with important applications in many areas, including autonomous driving, auto insurance, advanced driver assistance systems, urban computing, and the internet of things. Few studies have considered the interactions between different factors. In this study, we propose a novel trajectory representation method based on a multilevel attention mechanism (ATTraj2vec) and apply it to the task of driver identification. We use 1D CNN to summarize local features, including motion, spatial and temporal features. Then we utilize a multilevel attention mechanism to extract global features, aggregating the interactions of motion features with temporal and spatial features progressively. Additionally, we adopt multi-loss to optimize our model simultaneously, which consists of a softmax loss for driver classification and Siamese loss for making trajectories from the same driver more similar. Classification experimental results on a real-world automobile trajectory dataset demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms existing baselines. Meanwhile, the proposed method provides significant gains in the trajectory clustering of unseen drivers.

Row_265,"In the Karst Critical Zone (KCZ), mining and urbanization activities produce multiple pollutants, posing a threat to the vital groundwater and surface water resources essential for drinking and irrigation. Despite their importance, the interactions between these pollutants in the intricate hydrology and land use of the KCZ remain poorly understood. In this study, we unraveled the transformation mechanisms and sources of nitrogen, sulfate, and carbon using multiple isotopes and the MixSIAR model, following hydrology and surface analyses conducted in spatial modelling with ArcGIS. Our results revealed frequent exchange between groundwater and surface water, as evidenced by the analysis of delta D-H2O and delta O-18-H2O. Nitrification predominantly occurred in surface water, although denitrification also made a minor contribution. Inorganic nitrogen in both groundwater and surface water primarily originated from soil nitrogen (48 % and 49 %, respectively). Sewage and manure were secondary sources of inorganic nitrogen in surface water, accounting for 41 % in urban and 38 % in mining areas. Notably, inorganic sulfur oxidation displayed significant spatial disparities between urban and mining areas, rendering groundwater more susceptible to sulfur pollution compared to surface water. The frequent interchange between groundwater and surface water posed a higher pollution risk to groundwater. Furthermore, the primary sources of CO2 and HCO3- in both groundwater and surface water were water-carbonate reactions and soil respiration. Sulfide oxidation was found to enhance carbonate dissolution, leading to increased CO2 release from carbonate dissolution in the KCZ. These findings enhance our understanding of the transformation mechanisms and interactions of nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon in groundwater and surface water. This knowledge is invaluable for accurately controlling and treating water pollution in the KCZ.","Ye, Huijun","Han, Zhiwei","Wu, Pan","Zha, Xuefang","Li, Xuexian","Hou, Enqing","Cao, Yingjie","Tang, Changyuan","Zhang, Ruixue","Sardans, Jordi","Penuelas, Josep",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,Pollutant interaction,Complex land use,Karst Critical Zone,Multi-isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,APR 20 2024,"Disentangling sources and transformation mechanisms of nitrogen, sulfate, and carbon in water of a Karst Critical Zone"
Row_266,"Alonso (1964) developed the land use and transport interaction theory based on the bid and rent concept. It tells that the central core part of urban areas has the highest housing rental prices, and it gradually decays as it is further away from the center. The city's district is divided based on the distribution of land prices according to distance from the city center. This fundamental relationship provides a basic insight into how people behave rationally subject to their living budgets. Based on this relationship, this paper aims to investigate the temporal and spatial changes in the de facto population of Seoul caused by COVID-19. The de facto population has declined significantly since 2020. A major decrease has been found in areas within 2.5 km of travel distance from the city center. The de facto population decreased the most during the night hours(18:00 similar to 24:00) on weekdays and the daytime(10:00 similar to 18:00) on weekends.

In the last decade, coworking spaces have become an organisational innovation of the sharing economy in these systems. Therefore, research on spatial co-agglomeration between coworking spaces and service industries is rising, identifying creative industries as the most significant services for colocation with coworking spaces. Previous studies on spatial association between coworking spaces and service industries have focused on the global distance measurement of their co-agglomeration. Hence, the paper provides insight into the extension of the research by comparing two cross-sectional datasets at different times by locally measured multiple colocations between coworking spaces and the selected creative industries in Prague and Warsaw. The present study is expected to contribute to understanding the spatial association in the long-term trajectories of coworking spaces with creative industries. The results underline the importance of the usage of local colocation quotients in spacetime perspective for the detection of spatial association between coworking spaces and creative industries for determining trajectories of their spatial interactions, which resulted in both intensification and spatial diffusion of CBD functions in the adjacent inner city and along urban arterial roads supporting the polycentric metropolis model.","Bednar, Pavel","Micek, Grzegorz","Danko, Lukas",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,APPLIED GEOGRAPHY,Central europe,Coworking spaces,Creative industries,Economies of agglomeration,Global colocation quotient,Local colocation quotient,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,Multiple local co-agglomeration: Modelling spatial-temporal variations of coworking spaces and creative industries clustering in two central European Capitals

While there is a relatively good empirical and theoretical understanding of city size distributions, insights about their spatial organization remain on a conceptual level. Here, we analyze empirically the correlations between the sizes of cities (in terms of area) across long distances. Therefore, we (i) define city clusters, (ii) obtain the neighborhood network from Voronoi cells, and (iii) apply a fluctuation analysis along all shortest paths. We find that most European countries exhibit long-range correlations but in several cases these are anti-correlations. In an analogous way, we study a model inspired by Central Places Theory and find that it leads to positive long-range correlations, unless there is strong additional spatial disorder-contrary to intuition. We conclude that the interactions between cities extend over large distances reaching the country scale. Our findings have policy relevance as urban development or decline can affect cities at a considerable distance.","Li, Yunfei","Ural, Deniz","Kantelhardt, Jan W.","Rybski, Diego",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,PNAS NEXUS,city size,long-range correlations,spatial network,regional development,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 5 2024,Indication of long-range correlations governing city size

High levels of Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) can help mitigate a series of ecological problems faced by cities, which is extremely important for preserving the stability of urban ecosystems and promoting sustainable urban development. However, current research has not fully explored the influencing factors of UGI and the interaction effect between them. Therefore, in order to better explore the results of China's proposed policy to promote GI development, data from 110 cities in China's Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) region during the 12th Five-Year Plan and 13th Five-Year Plan periods were measured separately, and natural and geographic environmental conditions, quality of urban construction, level of economic development, sociocultural development, and eco-environmental quality were selected as the influencing factors. The entropy TOPSIS was used to evaluate the development trend of UGI in the two periods of the region, and the relationship between influencing factors and UGI development was investigated through the use of fs/QCA, and the high-level development path of each city to achieve GI was explained. The results show that (1) Cities with high UGI development are mostly concentrated in economically developed areas, while cities in the YREB's central and western regions have relatively low levels of UGI development. (2) According to the spatial and temporal differences, the factors driving the high level and non-high level of UGI development in prefecture-level cities in the YREB showed several different configurations, confirming that the development level of UGI was affected by a variety of conditions. (3) During the 12th Five-Year Plan to 13th Five-Year Plan periods, the configuration of urban high-level UGI was found to be more consistent, while the development path of non-high-level UGI is more diversified. The study explores the overall development level and trend of green infrastructure in different cities, and the citation of fs/QCA provides a better understanding of the complex mechanisms of the interactions between these variables, with a view to providing some guidance and enlightenment for enhancing the future urban UGI development and urban high-quality development in the Yangtze River Economic Belt.","Li, Mengmeng","Wang, Jinsong","Dong, Yanfeng","Zeng, Yanting","Shen, Ning","Liu, Wenjie","Tong, Zhu","Chen, Hong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,Urban green infrastructure,Influencing factors,Yangtze river economic belt region,Fuzzy qualitative comparative analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2024,What combinations drive the urban green infrastructure development in China ' s Yangtze River Economic Belt?- An empirical study based on fs/ QCA methodology

Row_271,"Continued population loss in the context of urban shrinkage has led to the transformation and reconfiguration of urban land use space, which in turn has had a major impact on regional habitats and ecosystem services. To explore the status of habitat quality (HQ) in shrinking cities, based on land use data from 2010 to 2020, this study uses the InVEST model to analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of HQ in shrinking cities. Then, we reveal the shrinkage effect of HQ in shrinking cities from the perspective of population change rate, and detect the dominant influencing factors of HQ in different types of shrinking cities with the help of geographical detector. The results show that:(1) From 2010 to 2020, the primary land use types in both shrinking and nonshrinking cities of the three northeastern provinces were forestland and cropland. However, there were significant differences in the area of construction land between the two categories of cities. (2) The HQ in both shrinking and non-shrinking cities showed a declining trend, yet the HQ index of shrinking cities was higher than that of non-shrinking cities. (3) The distribution of HQ in shrinking cities has a significant shrinkage effect, and HQ index gradually strengthens as urban shrinkage intensifies. Low-quality habitats have a strong distributional advantage in slightly shrinking cities, while severely shrinking cities tend to be dominated by high-quality habitats. (4) Population profile, economic development, industrial structure and built environment are important factors influencing the spatial heterogeneity of HQ in shrinking cities. However, the spatial determinants of HQ vary significantly among different types of shrinking cities in terms of dimensions and indicators, with twofactor interactions exerting a stronger influence than single-factor impacts.

Row_272,"The opening of high-speed rail (HSR) has led to land cover changes within cities or in areas adjacent to HSR stations, but these changes vary between different HSR stations. Many local governments in China have planned larger-scale HSR new cities around the station, but not all of them have been realized. Existing studies on China's HSR have mainly focused on the spatial scale of urban agglomerations and above, with less discussion of the built environment at the intra-city scale, and even less interaction studies based on a period of time span. This study takes 40 stations along the four major and earlier-opened HSR lines in the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration Region in China as examples, constructs two indexes of land cover scale and compactness level to measure the land change pattern in the station catchment area over a 10-year period from 2010 to 2020, and uses statistical analyses to explore the potential factors influencing such changes. The findings are as follows: (1) HSR promotes the incremental built-up land in the station area to accumulate adjacent to the stations; (2) HSR stations located at the edge or periphery of the city, or newly-built rather than upgraded stations, tend to have larger incremental land cover scale and compactness level, but newly-built HSR stations may also lead to loose spatial layout of the station areas. This study analyzes the impacts and potential factors of HSR stations on land change pattern in the station area over a 10-year time series, providing an empirical basis for future location selection of HSR stations, the urban function arranging in station areas, and the promotion of transit-oriented development in the station area.","Wang, Xinyi","Pan, Haixiao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,"SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACTS OF HIGH-SPEED RAIL SYSTEMS, IW-HSR 2023",,High-speed rail,Land cover,Station area,Location,Upgraded stations,Spatial form,Shanghai,,,,,,,,,,2024,Land Change Pattern in High-Speed Rail Station Area: Empirical Research on Yangtze River Delta Region in China from 2010 to 2020
Row_273,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing images used for semantic segmentation possess distinct features compared to urban street scene images, including high resolution and a complex background. Spatial information plays a pivotal role in enhancing the performance of semantic segmentation for high-resolution images. The dual-branch architecture for semantic segmentation incorporates supplementary branches to capture spatial information. However, prior research on dual-branch semantic segmentation neglected the interaction between the contextual and spatial branches, leading to suboptimal model performance. In this discourse, the article introduces a dual-branch semantic segmentation framework. This design advances the system's understanding of spatial information while facilitating inter-branch learning through two key modules. Initially, the spatial calibration feature extraction module employs frequency domain processing and learning tactics distinct from the contextual approach to generate image features under varied noise conditions. Calibration is achieved by generating features from diverse angles. Subsequently, the spatially-guided loss function directs the acquisition of spatial information for the spatial branch by condensing the deep image characteristics for the context branch. To assess the generalization capacity of the proposed method, experiments will be conducted on three different datasets. The proposed method's modules will be integrated into three representative dual-branch networks, allowing assessment of the generalization capacity of the key DBCG components. Empirical evidence demonstrates that this approach is highly effective, significantly surpassing the performance of the baseline network.","Mai, Chaoyun","Wu, Yibo","Zhai, Yikui","Quan, Hao","Zhou, Jianhong","Genovese, Angelo","Piuri, Vincenzo","Scotti, Fabio",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING,Semantic segmentation,Calibration,Autonomous aerial vehicles,Feature extraction,Spatial resolution,Semantics,Remote sensing,Convolutional neural network (CNN),deep learning,dual-branch calibration guided network,semantic segmentation,unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),,,,,2024,DBCG-Net: Dual Branch Calibration Guided Deep Network for UAV Images Semantic Segmentation

Exploring the spatial-temporal evolution and driving variables of its carbon emission efficiency (CEE) is crucial for realizing the goals of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality. The super-efficiency SBM model, the nuclear density method, and the spatial autocorrelation method were used to discuss the spatial-temporal CEE characteristics of 105 cities in the YREB. On the driving factors of carbon emissions, the geographic detector and the Tobit model were combined to explore the spatial differentiation characteristics of the driving factors from the perspective of heterogeneity, and concurrently analyze the single-factor's effecting intensity and impacting direction, as well as the dual-factors' interaction effects. The findings indicated that the CEE of YREB generally showed a slow upward trend during 2006-2021. From the perspective of time dynamic evolution, the differentiation of efficiency intensified, and the overall development was toward the high efficiency level. Furthermore, the results of spatial pattern evolution showed that the CEE presents the pattern of ""downstream areas > midstream areas > upstream areas"", ""high in the east and low in the west"", ""hot in the east and cold in the west"", while the spatial clustering effect was significant, showing the distributions of low-low clustering or high-high clustering. Moreover, the results of the geographic detector showed that government intervention, economic growth, and technological progress were the main driving factors. In addition, the interactions government intervention and the other factors were significantly detected. Tobit regression results showed that technological advancement and economic growth had a favorable impact on CEE, but foreign investment, urbanization, and government involvement had negative impacts.

However, the diversity of bacterial size and virulence in bacterial communities has been neglected, leading to limitations and inaccuracies in risk assessment. Surface-subsurface interactions lead to the complexity, variability, and insidiousness of pathogen transmission in the environment. Mountainous landfills are considered as a major source of pathogens in subsurface systems. Although numerous studies have reported the geographic distribution of microbes in landfills, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the impacts on the microbial spatial distribution of bacterial size, which is a key factor affecting microbial migration and risks. In this study, the groundwater, river water, soil and leachate samples were collected inside and around a typical mountainous urban landfill, which is close to a river with a high hydraulic gradient and a strong surface-subsurface interaction. Small-sized (<0.2 mu m) and largesized (>0.2 mu m) bacteria were separated to verify the variability of migration potential and spatial distribution of different sizes of bacteria in groundwater-surface water and soil, investigating the driving factors and accessing the biological risk of different sizes of bacteria. The results revealed notable differences in spatial distribution and driving factors among various bacterial sizes. Small-sized bacterial communities in groundwater and soils exhibited clear trends towards leachate along the water flow direction. In contrast, large-sized bacterial communities remained stable and resembled native bacterial communities. Groundwater hydrodynamics was the main driving force affecting the spatial distribution of small-sized bacteria. The small-sized bacteria showed a higher content of virulence genes which were predominantly expressed for invasion. Thus, small-sized bacteria exhibited a stronger migration potential and a higher biological risk. Due to the surface-subsurface interactions, the bacterial communities in river water were more similar to that in groundwater after rain.

This article focuses on formalization's sociopolitical dimension, entailing the registration of residents and the establishment of formal governance provisions and new citizenship expectations. The provision of formal housing and recognized housing tenure has, designedly, been coupled with the establishment of official self-governance mechanisms leading to new civic responsibilities and reshaping the experience of citizenship among former slum dwellers. We explore these governance arrangements, the interaction between formality and informal governance processes and how these arrangements impact residents' perspectives on citizenship. We also identify several challenges to effective self-governance and the ways in which formal and informal processes shape residents' experiences of community life, citizenship and urban integration. While residents have benefited from some aspects of formalization (e.g. indoor plumbing and codified tenure rights), it has brought additional burdens, and the challenges of self-governance have, for many relocatees, reproduced a kind of marginalized citizenship within formal structures.","Chaskin, Robert J.","Vyas, Mouleshri","Jha, Manish k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN AND REGIONAL RESEARCH,formalization,citizenship,urban restructuring,housing,governance,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2024,"Formalization, Citizenship and the Challenges of Self-Governance in Mumbai's Slum Relocation Colonies"

In a four year PhD study on self-organised design processes in spatial planning of commercial streets, it was observed that scarcity is often defined as a condition defined by an insufficiency of resources. This limited view leads to unidirectional urban planning processes, insufficiently responding to very diverse experiences of scarcity in African cities. The PhD study developed a design anthropological approach by engaging in daily co-working interactions with plot owners and tenants to enable a deeper understanding of their everyday urban realities and thus what is scarce. Differently from some reported co-design trajectories with organisations and authorities in western contexts, residents often do not have the means or time to engage in intensive participatory design trajectories. Therefore, we see a need for more attention for co-designing methods and tools that tap into the social and physical assets and related experiences of scarcity already present in daily life. Such methods and tools can be flexibly employed by the vast actors in their self-organised planning processes in urban Africa where scarcity is a major concern.","Besha, Richard","Huybrechts, Liesbeth","Kombe, Wilbard",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,CODESIGN-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COCREATION IN DESIGN AND THE ARTS,Self-organisation,co-design,participatory design,commercial street,scarcity,livelihood assets,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 1 2024,"Co-designing with scarcity in self- organised urban environments: a case of Shekilango commercial street in Sinza, Dar es Salaam - Tanzania"

Row_279,"Human activities have triggered biodiversity loss, often resulting in biotic homogenization, which poses a threat to human well-being. Nevertheless, the overall influence of diverse environmental stressors on intra- and intercommunity diversity remains insufficiently elucidated. This study aimed to quantify and reveal the impact of environmental stressors on the alpha and beta diversities of benthic diatom communities in the Harbin urban river network during the summer and autumn of 2022 and spring of 2023. The marked seasonal variations observed in alpha and beta diversity indices highlighted the distinct community compositions. Nonetheless, varying types of urban water pollutants were the primary drivers of biotic homogenization in terms of both taxonomic and functional diversities and played a prominent role in steering diversity shifts. These pollutants indirectly led to biotic homogenization by altering water quality parameters and affecting the ecological dynamics of benthic diatom communities. Furthermore, diverse responses to stressors were identified in taxonomic and functional diversities, providing additional insights for understanding ecological shifts in communities. Taxonomic beta diversity was related to environmental filtering, whereas functional beta diversity resulted from stressor-spatial dimension interactions.

Row_280,"Urban greenspaces face significant anthropogenic transformation, impacting soil ecosystems, multifunctionality, and global biodiversity. With increasing population and urbanization, understanding the drivers influencing soil nematode communities in urban greenspaces is crucial for sustainable urban ecosystem management. We chose the campus of The Ohio State University (OSU) due to its unique urban settings with minimally disturbed both turf and non-turf ecosystems. This study focuses on nematodes, the often-overlooked ecological engineers which play diverse roles in ecosystem functions. Nematodes were collected from 99 sampling locations across three soil depths to represent two ecosystem types (i.e., turf and non-turf) of the OSU campus. Among plant parasitic nematodes (PPN), Helicotylenchus and Pratylenchus populations were above damage threshold limits. No specific pattern of community composition was observed in the spatial variation map. The presence of rare PPN genera in the lower soil layers had a significant impact on beta diversity. Trophic group abundances displayed distinct patterns, with turf ecosystems exhibiting higher PPN as well as total nematode abundance decreasing with soil depths. In the subsurface layer (10-30 cm), both bacterivores and fungivores were higher in the non-turf than turf ecosystem. Fungal-dominated decomposition of organic matter was observed in both ecosystem types. Soil physiochemical properties, specifically, total organic carbon and soil texture, had a significant impact on PPN community composition. However, nematode trophic group composition was more altered by ecosystem type than edaphic factors followed by soil depths. Together these three explanatory variables explained 27.5 % of the total variance in trophic group composition. Overall, this study provides insights into the complex interactions between PPN, trophic groups, soil properties, and urban ecosystem characteristics, contributing valuable knowledge for sustainable urban greenspace management.","Mondal, Sandip","Burgos-Hernandez, Tania","Ralston, Timothy I.","Simon, Abasola C.

Row_281,"Rocky shore communities are shaped by complex interactions among environmental drivers and a range of biological processes. Here, we investigated the importance of abiotic and biotic drivers on the population structure of key rocky intertidal species at 62 sites, spanning 50% of the Brazilian rocky shoreline (i.e., 500 km). Large-scale population patterns were generally explained by differences in ocean temperature and wave exposure. For the gastropod species Lottia subrugosa, differences at smaller scales (i.e., 0.1-1 km) were better explained by other abiotic influences such as freshwater discharge and substrate roughness. Based on the general population patterns of intertidal species identified, three main oceanographic groups were observed: a coldoligotrophic grouping at northern sites (Lakes sub-region), a eutrophic group associated with large estuaries and urban zones (Santos and Guanabara bays); and a transitional warm-water group found between the two more productive areas. Larger individuals of Stramonita brasiliensis, L. subrugosa and Echinolittorina lineolata were generally found in the cold-oligotrophic system (i.e., upwelling region), while small suspension feeders dominate the warm-eutrophic systems. Evidence of bottom-up regulation was not observed, and top-down regulation effects were only observed between the whelk S. brasiliensis and its mussel prey Perna perna. Environmental drivers as compared to biotic interactions, therefore, play a key role determining the population structure of multiple intertidal species, across a range of spatial scales along the SW Atlantic shores.","Cordeiro, Cesar A.

Row_282,"Assessing street walkability is a critical agenda in urban planning and multidisciplinary research, as it facilitates public health, community cohesion, and urban sustainability. Existing evaluation systems primarily focus on objective measurements, often neglecting subjective assessments and the diverse walking needs influenced by different urban spatial elements. This study addresses these gaps by constructing a comprehensive evaluation framework that integrates both subjective and objective dimensions, combining three neighbourhood indicators: Macro-Scale Index, Micro-Scale Index, and Street Walking Preferences Index. A normalization weighting method synthesizes these indicators into a comprehensive index. We applied this framework to assess the street environment within Beijing's Fifth Ring Road. The empirical results demonstrate that: (1) The framework reliably reflects the distribution of walkability. (2) The three indicators show both similarities and differences, underscoring the need to consider the distinct roles of community and street-level elements and the interaction between subjective and objective dimensions. (3) In high-density cities with ring-road development patterns, the Macro-Scale Index closely aligns with the Comprehensive Index, demonstrating its accuracy in reflecting walkability.

In this study, pedestrian-level thermal environmental parameters and PM2.5 concentration were measured and compared across different urban functional zones (UFZs). Additionally, multiple linear regression (MLR), principal component analysis (PCA), and principal component regression (PCR) were employed to analyze the main controlling factors of PM2.5 and air temperature. The findings reveal that regional microclimate temperatures differ significantly, with variations of 2.68-4.31 degrees C compared to typical MET data. Notably, the Sky View Factor (SVF) emerged as the dominant influence on temperature variations, while PM2.5 concentrations were primarily driven by a combination of ENV (BD, SVF, GnPR) and MET factors (Ta, RH, TSr). The PCR model demonstrated superior predictive accuracy for PM2.5 concentrations (Adjusted R-squared = 0.78) compared to the MLR model (Adjusted Rsquared = 0.63).

Therefore, based on the 2000-2022 MODIS NDVI dataset, supplemented by climatic, topographic, surface cover, and anthropogenic data for the same period, the Sen+Mann-Kendall trend analysis, coefficient of variation, and Hurst exponent were employed to examine the spatial and temporal characteristics and trends of NDVI in Hubei Province, and a partial correlation analysis and geographical detector were used to explore the strength of the influence of driving factors on the spatial differentiation of NDVI in vegetation and the underlying mechanisms of interaction. The results showed that (1) the mean NDVI value of vegetation in Hubei Province was 0.762 over 23 years, with an overall increasing trend and fluctuating upward at a rate of 0.01/10a (p < 0.005); geospatially, there is a pattern of ""low east and high west""; the spatial change in NDVI shows a trend of ""large-scale improvement in the surrounding hills and mountains and small-scale degradation in the middle plains""; it also presents the spatial fluctuation characteristics of ""uniform distribution in general, an obvious difference between urban and rural areas, and a high fluctuation of rivers and reservoirs"", (2) the future trend of NDVI in 70.76% of the region in Hubei Province is likely to maintain the same trend as that of the 2000-2022 period, with 70.78% of the future development being benign and dominated by sustained improvement, and (3) a combination of partial correlation analysis and geographical detector analysis of the drivers of vegetation NDVI change shows that land cover type and soil type are the main drivers; the interactions affecting the distribution and change characteristics of NDVI vegetation all showed two-factor enhancement or nonlinear enhancement relationships.

Row_285,"Tourist activity has a powerful capacity to transform landscapes, often modifying natural or semi-natural spaces in favour of increasingly dense urban structures. This change is particularly evident in Mediterranean coastal areas, and specifically in Spain's La Manga del Mar Menor in the Region of Murcia, whose environment and landscape have been altered from the 1960s onwards. During this time, intense urbanisation based on the sun and beach tourism model has been developed, which represents a bad example of urban land-use planning. Speculation and the lack of a sustainable tourist model in those years have created a 22-km linear city along a coastal strip, currently characterised by a densified tourist area. This situation is due to the lack of urban planning and a series of other problems, such as the lack of basic services and facilities, saturation in access to them and environmental pollution. In this spatial context, the geography of perception's methodology will serve as an analytical tool in aspects related to the lived space and the interaction of residents and tourists. This is combined with a DAFO/SWOT-CAME analysis and the use of photographs and cartographies as key research instruments. The aim of this work is to analyse the intense urbanisation that has taken place in this coastal area and to show the need to carry out urban development actions within the framework of a possible new plan aimed at halting environmental deterioration, organising land use, creating more spaces for public services and protecting, to a greater extent, beaches and other natural and cultural resources.

Row_287,"The Chaobai River Basin, which is a crucial ecological barrier and primary water source area within the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, possesses substantial ecological significance. The gross ecosystem product (GEP) in the Chaobai River Basin is a reflection of ecosystem conditions and quantifies nature's contributions to humanity, which provides a basis for basin ecosystem service management and decision-making. This study investigated the spatiotemporal evolution of GEP in the upper Chaobai River Basin and explored the driving factors influencing GEP spatial differentiation. Ecosystem patterns from 2005 to 2020 were analyzed, and GEP was calculated for 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020. The driving factors influencing GEP spatial differentiation were identified using the optimal parameter-based geographical detector (OPGD) model. The key findings are as follows: (1) From 2005 to 2020, the main ecosystem types were forest, grassland, and agriculture. Urban areas experienced significant changes, and conversions mainly occurred among urban, water, grassland and agricultural ecosystems. (2) Temporally, the GEP in the basin increased from 2005 to 2020, with regulation services dominating. At the county (district) scale, GEP exhibited a north-west-high and south-east-low pattern, showing spatial differences between per-unit-area GEP and county (district) GEP, while the spatial variations in per capita GEP and county (district) GEP were similar. (3) Differences in the spatial distribution of GEP were influenced by regional natural geographical and socioeconomic factors. Among these factors, gross domestic product, population density, and land-use degree density contributed significantly. Interactions among different driving forces noticeably impacted GEP spatial differentiation. These findings underscore the necessity of incorporating factors such as population density and the intensity of land-use development into ecosystem management decision-making processes in the upper reaches of the Chaobai River Basin. Future policies should be devised to regulate human activities, thereby ensuring the stability and enhancement of GEP.","Li, Jiacheng","Han, Qi","Zhang, Liqiu","Feng, Li","Liu, Guihuan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING,Ecosystem pattern,Gross ecosystem product (GEP),Spatiotemporal evolution,Optimal parameter-based geographical detector (OPGD),Chaobai River Basin,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 2024,Analyzing the spatiotemporal evolution and driving forces of gross ecosystem product in the upper reaches of the Chaobai River Basin
Row_288,"Achieving carbon neutrality necessitates a dual focus on minimizing carbon emissions and maximizing carbon sequestration, rather than solely concentrating on emission reduction. This study proposes a Carbon Pressure Index (CPI) to assess the equilibrium between emissions and sequestration, determine the factors influencing varying carbon pressure levels, and formulate region-specific strategies based on these levels. A nested methodological approach, combining spatiotemporal leaps analysis and quantile regression, is employed to appraise county-level carbon pressure dynamics across multiple quantiles in the central-south Liaoning urban agglomeration (CSLUA) from 2002 to 2021. Three principal findings were derived: Firstly, the spatiotemporal distribution of the CPI across CSLUA districts and counties demonstrates regional differentiations conforming to a gradient pattern, with values declining from urban centers toward peripheral areas. Carbon pressure is greater in the west, less in the east, and critically high in the central-western zones. Secondly, the spatial distribution of the CPI indicates clear high-high and low-low agglomeration clusters, suggesting persistent local structures that indicate path dependence and resistance to change in carbon pressure transfer. While the central-western regions exhibit further changes, the eastern areas maintain relative stability. Thirdly, environmental technology factors constrain most districts and counties, while the combined influence of industrial activity and population, along with economic and urbanization pressures, have predominant effects in smaller areas in the central-western region. This highlights the effectiveness of the nested spatiotemporal leaps and quantile regression model in explaining the driving forces underlying the spatiotemporal shifts in CPI. The results suggest that attaining superior regional low-carbon development requires rectifying the asymmetry between carbon sources and sinks, considering the driving forces of diverse transition pathways and their interactions, to finally achieve synergistic optimization that incorporates both shared and unique regional characteristics.","Liu, Xinrui","Guo, Rongfei","Zhang, Yabing","Liu, Na","Zhang, Jian",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,Carbon pressure,Local Indicators of Spatial Association,Spatiotemporal transition,Quantile regression,Urban agglomeration,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,"Spatiotemporal evolution and influencing mechanisms of carbon pressure at the county scale: A case study of central-south Liaoning urban agglomeration, China"

Row_290,"Urban nature is widely known to provide wellbeing benefits to people and communities, but evidence particularly from diverse and disadvantaged contexts suggests that these benefits are not experienced equally by all. This paper unpacks this complexity by focussing on how urban nature is interacted with to produce relational wellbeing on two diverse inner-city housing estates undergoing regeneration in London, UK. We focus on the role of both formal institutions and the perceptions that people form of spatial features and their meanings and functions, and the manner in which these intermediaries shape human-nature interactions and the co-production of nature's wellbeing impact. Our findings from quantitative and qualitative data demonstrate that urban nature contributes to all aspects of a five-dimensional notion of wellbeing. But social housing residents' and young peoples' ability to experience these benefits is limited. Informal mechanisms of social control such as perceptions of ownership of space and its appropriate uses, and fear of conflict and crime limit the extent to which residents access greenspaces and the activities within them. Together with formal institutions such as tenancy types, housing targets and criteria for optimisation of site allocation, they produce hierarchies of use of public greenspaces and reinforce existing divisions between people of different demographic and socio-economic status. The findings underline the need to facilitate the establishment of shared and inclusive norms concerning access and appropriate uses of natural spaces in housing and greenspace delivery.","Juntti, Meri","Ozsezer-Kurnuc, Sevda","Dash, Nicholas",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,Urban nature,Wellbeing,Commodification,Regeneration,Urban planning,,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 2025,"'It's not necessarily a social space' - Institutions, power and nature's wellbeing benefits in the context of diverse inner-city neighbourhoods"

They are also highly persecuted by humans, however, due to their noxious smell and propensity to carry disease. Consequently, the species is relatively understudied and there is still much unknown about the factors that affect their occurrences. To determine the probability of use patterns of striped skunks at the local (within 100 m) and landscape (within 1 km) scales, we deployed 46 and 54 motion -activated cameras between Dec 2021 - Jun 2022 and Nov 2022 - May 2023, respectively, across sites throughout the state of Illinois. We used an a priori , hypothesis -based approach to model striped skunk occupancy. The best local -scale probability of use model included road density and urban edge ( w = 0.79), suggesting an avoidance of roads and selection for the interfaces of urban environments by skunks. The best model at the landscape scale included the interaction of housing density and coyote ( Canis latrans ) relative abundance ( w = 0.31), describing a spatial niche differentiation among coyotes and skunks in urban settings compared to rural environments. Overall, our results suggest the primary drivers of striped skunk use in Illinois are anthropogenic features, but there exists a nuanced relationship, confirming the species ' designation as synanthropic misanthrope. Meanwhile, humans may mediate shifts in space -use patterns among sympatric mesocarnivores due to an expansion and divergence of ecological niches, resulting in reduced spatial overlap and competitive pressures among species.","Proudman, Nathan J.","Allen, Maximilian L.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Camera trap,Illinois,Mephitis mephitis,Mesocarnivore,Mesopredator,Occupancy,Synanthropic,Urbanization,,,,,,,,,AUG 2024,Anthropogenic features are the most important drivers of striped skunk ( Mephitis mephitis ) space use in a human-dominated Midwestern landscape

However, traditional research methods primarily focus on UGS distribution and aggregation through 2D mapping, often neglecting the quality and vitality of urban natural environments. This limited approach hampers our full understanding of the complex issues and opportunities surrounding UGS. This study proposes a novel concept of Implied Urban Nature Vitality (IUNV) and evaluation framework that offers a comprehensive lens to understand better and evaluate the manifold human -urban -nature interactions in modern cityscapes. Based on our IUNV framework, an interdisciplinary investigation is conducted to show the distribution and populationlevel perceived IUNV in San Francisco by leveraging a triad of data sources: census, street -built environment, and social media data. Utilizing census data, we analyze socio-economic influences on UGS distribution and IUNV, including factors such as education, age demographics, income, and ethnicity. Street view imagery (SVI), analyzed with advanced image recognition algorithms, serves as a proxy for visual and physical aspects of IUNV, highlighting features like trees, sky, buildings, and roads. This analysis paints a granular picture of UGS ' s spatial distribution and physical attributes, facilitating an objective measure of IUNV. Subsequently, we analyze Flickr photos related to urban natural areas, examining their distribution and identifying thematic clusters that illuminate various aspects of UGS vitality. Lastly, we combine computer vision and manual review to define 12 IUNV themes from architecture and nature, eco-friendly gatherings, to cultural performance, exploring the relationship between the vitality clusters and the independent variables.

Row_296,"Aligned with the imperatives of national ecological civilization construction, the systematic investigation into the intricate interplay between shifts in land utilization and the assessment of ecosystem services plays a pivotal and indispensable role in advancing ecological civilization. This endeavor holds significant implications. It aids in optimizing the ecological landscape at the regional level and fosters harmonious coexistence between humanity and the natural world. The study utilizes land-use remote sensing interpretation data from three time periods (2000, 2010, and 2020) and employs various methodologies, including equivalent factor coefficient correction, sensitivity analysis, and spatial autocorrelation. The objective is to uncover the spatiotemporal dynamics of land-use changes and Ecosystem Service Value (ESV) in Lanzhou City. Furthermore, geographic detectors are applied to explore the driving factors influencing ESV spatial heterogeneity and their interactions. The research findings indicate the following: (1) From 2000 to 2020, grassland and cropland were the predominant land-use types in Lanzhou City, with cropland and urban land experiencing the most active changes. (2) ESV in Lanzhou City increased from 179.37 billion RMB in 2000 to 193.86 billion RMB in 2020, reflecting an ESV total growth rate of 8.07% and a gradual improvement in the ecological environment. Spatially, ESV exhibits a ""west high, east low"" distribution pattern, with the center shifting towards the northwest and southeast, gradually reducing spatial imbalance. (3) Analysis of ESV spatial autocorrelation reveals that high-high clusters are predominantly found within the Tulu Gou National Forest Park and the Xinglong Mountain National Natural Reserve, while low-low clusters are primarily concentrated in the central urban area of Lanzhou City. Over the period from 2000 to 2020, the spatial clustering effect of ESV within the study area has progressively intensified. 4)NDVI, precipitation, and GDP emerge as pivotal factors influencing spatial differentiation within Lanzhou City, with natural and societal elements exerting interactive effects on ESV spatial disparities. The research results integrate environmental considerations into the decision-making process, offering valuable insights for formulating targeted ecological protection policies in Lanzhou City. This study embodies concrete measures taken by Lanzhou City in practicing China's concept of ""green water and green mountains are golden silver mountains,"" providing a theoretical basis for the harmonious and sustainable development of the ecological economy.","Qiao, Hongqiang","Kang, Yongwei","Niu, Yali",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Ecosystem Service Value,Spatiotemporal evolution,Geographic detector,Lanzhou City,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 4 2024,"Spatiotemporal dynamics and driving factors of ecosystem services value in Lanzhou City, China"
Row_297,"Climate change caused by rapid urbanization in the Guanzhong region of China is becoming an increasingly significant problem. Previous empirical studies have confirmed that landscape patterns inextricably linked with the thermal environment, but static results based on a single temporal cross section of image data provide only a partial understanding. In this paper, we constructed a dynamic framework using Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) for temperature simulation and Geodetector to study the landscape factors and their interactions that influence near-surface temperature (NST) changes in the Guanzhong Plain Urban Agglomeration (GPUA) between 2000 and 2020. Results showed that the GPUA average NST increased by 0.012 degrees C and 0.053 degrees C in January and July from 2000 to 2020, respectively. In terms of the dynamic correlation between landscape patterns and NST, cropland (CPL) was negative, urban land (UBL) was positive, and the remainder of the landscapes differed in winter and summer. Furthermore, results from the Geodetector showed that UBL embodied a stronger influence in summer than during winter months. This finding helps to explain why the average NST increase is higher in summer than during winter. The Dynamic Q values (DQ) of the area-based landscape metrics were generally larger than those of other spatial configuration metrics, and the interaction results showed that the landscape metrics of various land-cover classifications were enhanced, indicating that the superposition effect among landscape metrics needs to be taken into account in landscape planning in addition to area factors. The study of the relationship between landscape patterns and thermal environment considering dynamic perspective using WRF offers an important theoretical reference allied with practical guidance for understanding and adapting to forthcoming change in our climate through which we can help drive sustainable development decisions of the GPUA.","Chen, Long","Li, Heng","Zhang, Chunxiao","Chu, Wenhao","Corcoran, Jonathan","Wang, Tianbao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION,Landscape pattern,Near-surface temperature,Weather Research and Forecasting Model,(WRF),Dynamic analysis,Guanzhong Plain Urban Agglomeration,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 2024,Dynamic analysis of landscape drivers in the thermal environment of Guanzhong plain urban agglomeration
Row_298,"Rapid urbanization and industrialization have greatly contributed to boosting regional economic growth and mitigating the problem of poverty, but blind expansion of cities and towns has not only caused the inefficient use of urban land resources but also caused the deterioration in the urban ecological environment. Within the current context of emphasizing high-quality development, achieving synergy between the efficient use of urban land and ecological environmental protection is an urgent task for promoting new urbanization construction. In this study, cities in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River (URYR) were adopted as the research object, a theoretical analysis framework for the urban land use efficiency (ULUE) and ecological environment quality (EEQ) was established, the ULUE was measured by using the Slacks-Based Measure (SBM) model, the coupling coordination and interactive corresponding response relationship between the ULUE and EEQ were analyzed, and the influencing factors of the coupling coordination between these two systems were explored by using the random forest model. The following conclusions can be obtained: in 2020, compared with those in 2006, both the ULUE and EEQ were improved, and the two systems exhibited interactions and significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity. The coupling coordination degree (CCD) between the ULUE and EEQ could facilitate maintaining the original state, and the transfer of the CCD exhibited a significant spatial correlation with the state of neighbouring cities. The effect of the ULUE on the EEQ indicated nonlinear characteristics, while the effect of the EEQ on the ULUE was manifested as inhibition initially and then promotion. The random forest regression results showed that the population density, landscape agglomeration and connectivity, market conditions, government intervention, and industrial institutions are the key influencing factors of the CCD. Finally, this study provides policy implications for innovative urban land use modelling, environmental regulation, and industrial transformation and upgrading.","Su, Xuyang","Fan, Yamei","Wen, Chuanhao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,Urban land use efficiency,Ecological environment quality,Coupling coordination,Random forest model,,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 2024,Systematic coupling and multistage interactive response of the urban land use efficiency and ecological environment quality
Row_299,"Aboveground biomass (AGB) is a key parameter for assessing the carbon sequestration potential of urban ecosystems. However, traditional empirical models for AGB estimation often have poor transferability in urban environments, leading to overestimation or underestimation and limiting the ability to create continuous spatial maps of AGB. Recently, the relatively stable allometric relationships between forest structure and AGB have been further validated. With the increasing use of UAV remote sensing to monitor forest structural diversity (FSD) in urban areas, there is an urgent need to develop a method for quickly and accurately estimating AGB using FSD. This study focuses on an urban forestry demonstration base as the research area, aiming to establish an allometric growth model based on FSD to estimate AGB, grounded in the power-law relationship between forest structure and AGB. By systematically defining FSD, integrating UAV-LiDAR and multispectral data, and performing regression analysis, allometric modeling, model comparison, and accuracy assessment of extracted indicators, we thoroughly explored the optimal parameter combinations and estimation accuracy for estimating urban forest AGB using the FSD allometric model. The results show that combining FSD indicators through allometric relationships can improve AGB estimation accuracy to 80 % (R2b=0.80, RMSEb=2.79 kg/m2, MAEb=2.19 kg/m2), surpassing models that use only simplified FSD indicators (R2b=0.63). Additionally, the proposed method captures nonlinear relationships and complex interactions better than traditional MLR, avoiding the overfitting that can occur with RF and XGBoost. This study confirms that allometric relationships with FSD indicators can be used for AGB prediction, highlighting the biological and physiological significance of FSD. It provides an alternative solution for rapid and large-scale AGB assessment in Urban forest.","Zhai, Yalin","Wang, Lei","Yao, Yunlong","Jia, Jia","Li, Ruonan","Ren, Zhibin","He, Xingyuan","Ye, Zhiwei","Zhang, Xinyu","Chen, Yuanyuan","Xu, Yezhen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY,Aboveground biomass,Forest structural diversity,UAV,LiDAR,Allometric relationships,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 15 2025,Spatially continuous estimation of urban forest aboveground biomass with UAV-LiDAR and multispectral scanning: An allometric model of forest structural diversity
Row_300,"Black carbon (BC) has been linked to cardio-pulmonary diseases and lung cancer. It is also the second largest contributor to climate change, after carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), Effective mitigation of BC is of much benefits, but it requires detailed knowledge of its spatial distribution, as well as the influence of local meteorology on the spread of the pollutant. Many countries in sub -Sahara Africa including Nigeria, lack data on BC level. There is also limited information on meteorological impact on BC spatial distribution. This study therefore assessed the spatial and temporal distribution of BC across the 36 states of Nigeria and the influence of meteorology on the pollutant spread. Data on BC surface mass (BCMASS) and seven meteorological variables (air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, wind speed, planetary boundary layer height (PBLH), atmospheric pressure and wind direction) were obtained from Modern Era Retrospective analysis for Research (MERRA -2). Spatial distribution of BCSMASS across 36 states of Nigeria, and interaction with meteorology was studied using correlation analyses, Bayesian ridge regression with marginal maximum likelihood estimation, anda Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. There was significant (p < 0.05) variation in BCSMASS across the states. The meteorological variables, except wind direction, significantly influenced BCSMASS and they accounted for 63% of the variation. Five -day backward trajectory modelled for each month of the year revealed that northern Nigeria is majorly under the influence of the dry and dusty tropical continental wind, and this could partially account for the lower BCSMASS concentration in the region, compared to southern Nigeria. Based on population-weighted exposure, states in southern Nigeria, especially the south-eastern part, should be prioritized in planning mitigation, for effective climate action.","Etchie, Ayotunde Titilayo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT,Climate change,HYSPLIT model,Backward trajectory,Bayesian ridge regression,Sub-Saharan Africa,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 2024,Interaction of black carbon surface mass with meteorological variables and spatial pattern across the 36 states of tropical Nigeria
