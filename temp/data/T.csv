Row_1,". Novel technologies have resulted in the unprecedented and dynamic development of transport systems-one of the most important sectors of the economy. The implementation of smarter commuting solutions, in order to improve the processes of transportation, allows for cost and energy saving, better organization of time, and, as a result, an increase in quality of life. Also, this supports the operationalization of the sustainable development concept, enabling a compact and efficient urban transport system to be developed. The purpose of this paper is to analyze smart urban mobility development prerequisites and challenges, taking Gdynia city public and shared transport users' preferences and transport behavior as a case study. A research hypothesis has been formulated stating that most commuters have sufficient digital competencies and benefit from the available modern technological solutions contributing to smarter and more sustainable urban development. The obtained results prove the importance of the role the digital world plays these days and show how the impact of technology on the transportation sector has helped to develop new opportunities for urban mobility.","Przybylowski, Adam","Kaszuba, Agnieszka","Suchanek, Michal",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,TRANSPORT PROBLEMS,smart and sustainable mobility,public and shared transport,cities,digital competencies,,,,,,,,2024,SMART AND SUSTAINABLE URBAN MOBILITY - PUBLIC AND SHARED TRANSPORT USERS' BEHAVIOR IN GDYNIA CITY: A CASE STUDY
Row_2,"In Dakar, the capital of Senegal, the urban transport policy aims to restructure and modernize the supply of public transport. The implementation of this policy since the years 2000 has led to the creation of the public bus company Dakar Dem Dikk and the replacement and reorganization of a number of minibuses owned by informal operators, which locally go under the name of Tata. However, this new supply still coexists with older, more or less informal, transport modes, mainly ""Cars Rapides"" and ""Ndiaga Ndiaye"" minibuses, collective clandestine taxis, and ""yellow and black"" taxis. The question then arises as to the impact of the new public transport supply on the mobility practices of the city's residents. Data from two household mobility surveys, undertaken respectively in 2000 and 2015, in the Region of Dakar is used to conduct a diachronic analysis of mobility behavior. The results highlight the extent to which changes in public transport supply have modified flows and mode use for different categories of urban residents, in a context where daily mobility is highly dependent on public transport.","Olvera, Lourdes Diaz","Plat, Didier","Pochet, Pascal",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,CASE STUDIES ON TRANSPORT POLICY,Travel behavior,Public Transport User,Informal transport,,,,,,,,,JUN 2024,Changes in daily mobility and new public transport supply in Dakar (2000 - 2015)
Row_3,"Highlights What are the main findings? Results show that private car indexes for mobility, competitiveness and accessibility are higher than those of public transport. Significant variability in performance indicators among city areas are identified, indicating inequalities in social and environmental sustainability in urban systems. What are the implications of the main findings? Policy actions need to be tailored to the specific area of the city based on quantitative evidence. Strategies need to consider multiple dimensions to effectively support the use of public transport.Abstract The transport sector worldwide relies heavily on oil products, and private cars account for the largest share of passenger mobility in several countries. Public transport could represent an interesting alternative under many perspectives, including a decrease in traffic, pollutants, and climate emissions. However, for public transport to succeed, it should be attractive for final users, representing a viable alternative to private mobility. In this work, we analyse the spatial distribution of public transport service provision within two metropolitan cities, considering the three key dimensions of mobility, competitiveness, and accessibility of public transport. The results show that private car performs better than public transport in all scopes considered, and that performance indicators are highly variable among city areas, indicating inequalities in social and environmental sustainability in urban systems. The outcomes of the analysis provide interesting insights for policy makers and researchers that deal with similar topics, and can also be extended to other cities and countries.","Zini, Alessandro","Roberto, Roberta","Corrias, Patrizia","Felici, Bruna","Noussan, Michel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,SMART CITIES,urban mobility,public transport,accessibility,equity,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,Accessibility Measures to Evaluate Public Transport Competitiveness: The Case of Rome and Turin
Row_4,"To promote territorial mobility and reduce environmental impacts at the same time, transport policy often targets (energy-)efficiency of urban transport systems. Thus far though, related studies are focused on particular transport modes or operators. Given, the multi-modal character of urban mobility, the present study suggests broadening the perspective and accounting for public and private transport. Based on a two-stage non-parametric technique, the efficiency of 49 German municipalities alongside transport systems' inefficiency determinants is assessed. In line with previous studies, we find highly populated municipalities to operate more efficiently than smaller ones. Second, efficiency is driven by modal split and individual mobility patterns, with a positive correlation between territorial mobility and trips made by bike or public transport. Finally, the results suggest that negative impacts of trip density (e.g. congestion) might counter the positive influence of higher compactness on efficiency, once a certain threshold of urbanization is reached.","Kaiser, Alexander","Schaffer, Axel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND TECHNOLOGY,Urban transport systems,German municipalities,environmental pressures,trip density,territorial mobility,transport efficiency,R40,R15,Q56,,,NOV 2024,Non-parametric efficiency analysis of urban transport systems
Row_5,"Urban mobility can be understood as a fundamental phenomenon of modernity. Since the 15th century, cities have gained substantial importance for the development of human life. Today, neoliberalism permeates our lives and has also taken hold in urban contexts, impacting issues such as urban mobility and public transportation. Tarragona is no exception to these dynamics and will serve as a case study to analyze and problematize the current situation. Thus, the primary objective of this research focuses on the evolution of demands for the right to urban mobility in Tarragona, taking into account its specific socio-historical variables. Utilizing qualitative methodology, this study employs techniques that range from bibliographic reviews and interviews to participant observation. In this regard, the Tarragona case will be contrasted with global historical processes of popular mobilization and urban mobility. The findings indicate a historical trajectory rooted in popular mobilization, where the role of neighborhood associations is crucial and is currently intertwined with a productive shift in the city, oriented toward the tourism sector, where civil society and state actors converge.","Hernandez, Francisco Perez",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,REVISTA DE TRANSPORTE Y TERRITORIO,PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION,URBAN MOBILITY,NEOLIBERAL CITY,POPULAR MOBILIZATION,TARRAGONA,,,,,,,JUL-DEC 2024,"Public Transport, Urban Mobility, and the Neoliberal City: The Ethnographic Case of Tarragona in the 20th and 21st Centuries"

It also ensures the stability of service provision and favorable conditions for the purchase of modern low-emission rolling stock and other investments.The paper, based on the experience in the operation of the urban collective transport in the central part of the Silesian Voivodeship, presents the direction of their evolution, so as to reduce the operators burden of the risk of events, which they cannot affect, but at the same time, only to a limited extent, to introduce risks and thereby an element of remuneration due to the services provision, depending on the transport volume. It is expected, that, together with relevant procedures for operators to submit conclusions and suggestions of changes in the transport offer, it will result in the increased productivity and rationality of the services provision by the urban public transport in cities.","Dydkowski, Grzegorz","Galecka, Wiktoria","Urbanek, Anna",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,"ADVANCED SOLUTIONS FOR MOBILITY IN URBAN AREAS, TSTP 2023",,urban transport,contracts,risk allocation,,,,,,,,,2024,Contracts of Transport Services Provision as a Factor of Increasing the Effectiveness of the Urban Public Transport

One of the dimensions that has not been extensively studied in the construction of quality of life indices is urban mobility, specifically public transport. Although there are works that assure the positive influence of public transport on citizens, there are no direct links with the quality of life in northern Patagonia. In relation to the above, the objective of this work is to determine whether there are deficiencies in spatial accessibility to public transport, in order to establish some relationships with the distribution of quality of life in the city of Neuquen. For this, population data and an index prepared at the census radius level were used. In addition, the routes and stops of public transport were analyzed using various GIS methodologies.

Using data from Shenzhen's public transportation system, this study presents an analytical framework based on multiplex networks to examine variations in multi-mode public transportation usage (metro, bus, taxi, and shared bike) and their correlation with the built environment. This framework encompasses the analysis of network topological characteristics, centrality, and communities. The examination of network topological characteristics reveals that the multiplex transportation network exhibits high global accessibility and local connectivity. Network centrality analysis, focusing on weighted outdegree centrality, captures the patterns of public transportation ridership. Centrality modeling, employing the light gradient boosting machine, demonstrates a nonlinear relationship between ridership and the built environment. Factors including population density, residential land use percentage, entertainment service density, restaurant density, and metro station density consistently exhibit positive correlations with ridership across different times of the day. The community structure analysis, using consensus community detection, indicates that distinct urban areas exhibit clustering behavior based on public transportation demand patterns, forming distinct communities that closely align with the functional zoning of urban planning. These findings could provide valuable insights for the strategic planning of transportation services and the built environment.","Li, Zhitao","Tang, Jinjun","Feng, Tao","Liu, Biao","Cao, Junqiang","Yu, Tianjian","Ji, Yifeng",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,APPLIED GEOGRAPHY,Urban mobility,Public transportation,Multiplex networks,Community detection,Built environment,,,,,,,AUG 2024,Investigating urban mobility through multi-source public transportation data: A multiplex network perspective

Row_11,". In today's urban mobility scene, the increasing number of private cars trying to travel through the city centers is one of the most onerous problems facing urban transport. Knowing about the impact that different transport demand management models can have on the efficiency of the urban transport system may be of key importance for developing solutions in this area. This knowledge is the main goal of the considerations undertaken. The observations presented in this article took place during the formation of a Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP) for the Bielsko-Bia & lstrok;a agglomeration. The author of the article is a member of the working group that prepared the SUMP project for the city. The study examined the effectiveness of mobility planning activities. The scope of these activities included collecting the data necessary to create a mobility plan, analyzing this data, building scenarios in the area of transport demand management, and designing the assessment of the adopted solutions. The article shows the procedure for creating a model of a SUMP for urban areas, which may be a prerequisite for municipal governments for effective applications for funding projects related to transport. The most important part of the analysis is the evaluation using integration indicators of selected key elements of the urban transport system of the Bielsko-Bia & lstrok;a agglomeration in the area of transfer accessibility. Such research allows us to answer the question of whether the locations of new railway stops proposed under the agglomeration SUMP contribute to increasing the integration of the urban transport system. The current research implements one of the dimensions of mobility management projects. Related goals are, among other things, to achieve more effective integration of the urban transport system. The analyses were carried out by measuring selected properties of the transport network and a survey questionnaire.","Bylinko, Leszek",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,TRANSPORT PROBLEMS,mobility management,mobility plan,integration of the urban public transportation system,,,,,,,,,2024,INTEGRATION OF AN URBAN TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM AS AN ELEMENT OF MOBILITY PLANS
Row_12,"Public transport inherently involves encounters with other people. For women, negotiating everyday overcrowded, unsafe, and unreliable conditions is a major barrier to accessing public transport mobility that triggers emotions. Using qualitative research methods - in-depth interviews and visual surveys - this study delves beyond understanding the barriers and looks at the affective realm to comprehend how affects and emotions shape accessibility, acceptability, and affordability of public transport for women in Kolkata. The disruptive affects of overcrowded, unsafe, and unreliable conditions produce emotional ordeals, increase travel time and costs, and restrict mobility. The sense of despair that emerges compels women to adjust, accept, and even opt out of overcrowded, unsafe, and unreliable public transport more often than not. This paper argues that affects, emotions, reactions, and consequences are entangled and impact the accessibility, acceptability, and affordability of public transport.

Row_13,"Introduction: Urban mobility can detrimentally impact city dwellers' health and quality of life, e.g. through air pollution, noise and traffic injuries, but offers opportunities for health promotion, e.g., through active travel. While the health impacts of transport are well known, the extent to which health is considered in mobility plans is less obvious. The European Commission encourages cities to develop Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs) to improve residents' quality of life. We assess how health is addressed in SUMPs by examining: i) key health and health equity terminology, ii) explicit transport pathways to health, iii) health targets and key performance indicators, and iv) the health-rationale of actions and measures. Methods: Using a customised health dictionary, we perform a quantitative text analysis of SUMPs issued from 2006 to 2023 (n = 230) from 31 European countries listed on the European Local Transport Information Service (Eltis) City Database. We further validate this by an in-depth qualitative analysis of a purposive sub-sample (n = 13). Results: The findings show that while the prominence of health in SUMPs seems to be increasing, the link between transport and equity, and social and mental wellbeing is not frequently discussed. Detailed targets and KPIs for several health pathways are scarce or missing, as are the health rationale and health outcomes for proposed measures. Overwhelmingly SUMPs' health aspirations focus on minimising detrimental health impacts of transport, primarily from traffic injuries and to a lesser extent from air pollution. Health related concepts such as accessibility and active travel feature prominently but are not explicitly identified as an opportunity to enhance health. Conclusion: Urban mobility planning across Europe seems to miss an opportunity to embrace mobility as a driver of health promotion.","Kasraian, Dena","Murdock, Hannah E.","Imani, Ahmadreza Faghih","Yu, Yurong","de Nazelle, Audrey","Stead, Dominic","Kahlmeier, Sonja",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT & HEALTH,Health,Sustainable urban mobility plans,Europe,Equity,Health pathways,,,,,,,NOV 2024,Health in mobility planning: An assessment of how health is considered in Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans
Row_14,"Urban transport has evolved based on three main visions: automobility, multimodality, and accessibility. The first dominates North American cities; the second, European; the third, significantly discussed in the literature, is still in the early stages of practical development, with a few limited examples. Each of the first two visions has an aligned planning paradigm to support aspirational goals and future directions. But implementation has been disappointing, owing to the appearance of anomalies; that is, unanticipated and unexplained mismatches between the vision and the paradigms that refuse to be resolved. The attempts are self-defeating, and result, for example, in congestion and road accidents. A review of the literature with some new insights can shed light on the problems and the anomalies of these two visions. For the third vision, a new paradigm has been proposed based on accessibility and polycentric and multi-timed cities, promising new insights and breakthroughs in the way of thinking about transport and cities. Some practical examples of accessibility cities are presented with a focus on people, places, land use changes, telecommunications, transportation demand management (TDM), and public and non-motorized transport. Some minor anomalies are discussed. In conclusion, enhancing accessibility in cities is crucial for creating more inclusive and sustainable urban environments that are less dependent on cars, but this vision and this paradigm still require further development to be accepted and implemented.","Filippi, Francesco",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,FUTURE TRANSPORTATION,,urban transport vision,urban planning paradigm,traffic,mobility,accessibility,transport and urban planning,sustainability,,,,,SEP 2024,"Visions, Paradigms, and Anomalies of Urban Transport"

Rapid urbanization since the 1960s led to economic-driven housing, granting some privileged groups easy access to city center amenities, while leaving others disconnected from economic hubs due to inadequate multimodal transport. To further investigate this issue, this study uses spatial autocorrelation to explore economic clustering based on housing types, followed by network analysis of multimodal urban transport accessibility and isochrone of activity centers using ArcGIS Pro and QGIS. The data used includes public transportation networks and integrated JakLingko programs, such as railbased transportation (KRL, MRT, LRT) and road-based public transportation (TransJakarta, mikrotrans, Royaltrans), followed by the 2022 Spatial Masterplan (RDTR) of DKI Jakarta, administration boundary (RT and RW level), Google Earth Imagery, and published statistics provided by Statistics Indonesia (BPS). Our findings show a correlation between the economic clustering of certain housing blocks and their access to public transportation. Middle to upper-class groups living in Central Jakarta tend to have better access to public transportation than those scattered around Jakarta. We argue that there is a need to reassess Jakarta's existing urban transportation network to develop an inclusive urban transportation system that would allow all city residents living in various residential areas to utilize public transit effectively.","Hafiudzan, Akmal","Kusumaningrum, Dwiyanti","Prasetyoputra, Puguh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,EIGHTH GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM 2023: GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE FOR SUSTAINABLE PLANET,,economic clustering,spatial autocorrelation,housing types,public transport,urban accessibility,,,,,,,2024,Who Gets the Most?

The validation of the UML method showed that it achieved a coefficient of determination of 0.836 when estimating OD flows using boarding-alighting data. Upon the successful validation, the proposed methodology was implemented to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on the mobility of the New York City subway system. The implementation results indicate that (1) the rise in the number of weekly new COVID-19 cases intensified the impact on the public transport mobility, but not as strongly as public health interventions; and (2) the inflows to and outflows from the center of the city were more sensitive to the impact of COVID-19.","Zhang, Lan","Liu, Kaijian",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,CITIES,COVID-19,Urban mobility,Origin-destination flow estimation,Unsupervised machine learning,,,,,,,,AUG 2024,Unsupervised origin-destination flow estimation for analyzing COVID-19 impact on public transport mobility

Row_21,"Taking a mixed method and comparative case study approach, this paper has analyzed the formulation process of mobility policy strategies and plans and their implementation in four Asian cities. The key findings are: (1) there was some evidence on leadership shown by mayors, governors, public transport administrators and police in all four cities; (2) limited stakeholder engagement in the whole process of policy formation to implementation and some forms of donor influence were observed in three capital cities that resulted in follow-up projects or studies; and (3) the implementation of policies and plans faced many challenges relating to leadership, resources, prioritization, and coordination among various organizations. There was much focus on the formulation of mobility policies and plans and the users could not feel a meaningful improvement to urban mobility services despite the implementation of large urban mobility projects. A comprehensive evaluation framework is proposed and used to evaluate the whole process of improving urban mobility from policy formulation to implementation. There seems to be much preference for large urban transit projects vis-`a-vis infrastructure for active mobility and low-cost solutions. The research also indicates the need for meaningful public engagement so that the mobility plans take a citizen-centric approach that reflects the needs of the urban residents, rather than taking a modernistic approach with solutions more suitable for middle-income groups. Delays in the implementation of major projects also suggest that more realistic planning, scheduling, and improvement in project management and coordination is necessary.","Regmi, Madan B.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Governance,Mobility,Policy,Strategy,Plan,Implementation,Asian cities,,,,,APR 2024,Governance of urban mobility policies and plans in Asian cities
Row_22,"Research on public transport systems is continually driven by the societal benefits of transport services. However, the nuanced effects of the built environment on public transport mode shares across different modes have received little attention. Using multi-source travel data from Shenzhen, this study presents an analytical framework, which integrates the light gradient boosting machine and Shapley additive explanations, to delve into the complex interplay among public transport modes. The results reveal that most origin-destination pairs with available metro services exhibit a metro share exceeding 50%, underscoring the high attractiveness of the metro. Travel distance emerges as the primary determinant of mode share, with transport-related characteristics proving more influential than land use modifications. This study identifies nonlinear effects of the built environment on mode share, with specific thresholds for built environment characteristics suggesting fine-tuned planning strategies. Metro station densities of 2 counts/km2 correlates with increased metro share, while bus stop densities of 15 counts/km2 are associated with higher bus share. Areas within 2 km of a metro station or with bus stop densities below 15 counts/km2 tend to have higher bike shares. Specific land use ratios and high levels of land use mix are linked to increased shares of certain modes.

Knowledge and use of the metro system varied across generations, with individuals younger than 60 reporting better SWB from metro use. PT interchanges consuming more than 12 min result in a significant decrease in SWB. The effect of interchange satisfaction on SWB was mediated by time consumption of PT interchanges. Transport information inquiry was frequently sought yet performed poorly in accuracy. The concerns about the punctuality of buses amplified the negative effects on SWB. Positive preferences of respondents for future mobility services could consolidate their PT participation and SWB. Conclusions: Simpler and more convenient access to the metro system, transport information inquiry methods with better accuracy, PT interchanges with shorter duration, and novel regulations and driving strategies for buses, could contribute to better subjective well-being across populations.","Dong, Yinan","Sun, Yilin","Wang, Dianhai","Waygood, E.

Understanding the effectiveness of these subsidies is crucial, particularly in cities where a substantial portion of the population, especially those with low incomes, rely on public transport systems. This paper presents a case study conducted in Bogota, Colombia, employing a randomized controlled field experiment involving 1607 participants. In this intervention, a randomly selected group of frequent public transport users received a cash transfer on their travel cards (a transport voucher) for four months. We aim to estimate the causal effects of providing these vouchers on ridership and affordability. The findings indicate that vouchers on average, increased ridership by up to 9% compared to the control group. This increase was most pronounced on weekdays and during peak hours. Vouchers proved particularly advantageous for populations with low fare-demand elasticity, who constitute the primary users of public transport. Furthermore, it improved their affordability by between 18 and 26%. In summary, our results indicate that providing subsidies in the form of vouchers can effectively boost public transport usage, thereby enhancing affordability for users.","Guzman, Luis A.","Cardona, Santiago Gomez","Ochoa, Jorge Luis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION ECONOMICS,Public transport,RCT,Public transport pricing,Travel voucher,Bogota,,,,,,,DEC 2024,Increased ridership and improved affordability: Transforming public transport subsidies in developing contexts

To achieve sustainable urban mobility objectives, political discussions have focused on promoting cycling, walking and using public transport in cities. These modes of transportation are attractive ways of commuting to and from work for a portion of the population. In the literature, there is a growing interest in the phenomenon of active commuting. This paper examines the spatio-temporal patterns and practices of active commuting and evaluates their significance in the context of sustainable urban mobility. The empirical research is based on data obtained from a questionnaire survey and semistructured interviews conducted in 2023 in the Brno Metropolitan Area. Based on the data, three categories of active commuting were identified, namely pragmatic active commuting, physical active commuting, and combined active commuting, which differ in the implementation of different spatio-temporal practices. For the development of sustainable transport in the city, it is necessary to promote the construction of pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure, with the aim of making movement for pedestrians and cyclists more straightforward, efficient, and safer, including paying attention to actions leading to the embedding of this mode of transport in the wider societal context.","Gorny, David",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,MORAVIAN GEOGRAPHICAL REPORTS,Active commuting,spatio-temporal practices,urban mobility,transport mode,Brno Metropolitan Area,physical activity,,,,,,SEP 1 2024,Active commuting as a form of sustainable urban mobility: The case of the Brno Metropolitan Area

Thereby I draw attention to how platform transportation workers in Mumbai, India, produce mobility services by collaboratively linking the social and material resources of the city. Networks and communities of transport workers have long been essential for providing intermediate mobility services in Mumbai, and continue to do so in the platform era. Building on these observations, I inquire whether there is potential for the creation of worker-centric platform models that benefit both the workers and the larger urban majority. Therefore, drawing on my fieldwork in Mumbai, I first explore how the current model of digital mobility platforms in Mumbai reinforces socio-spatial fragmentation in Mumbai while leaving workers with decreasing earnings and rising work pressure. Considering the agency of platform workers, I then aim to uncover how platform workers appropriate platform mechanisms and engage their collective knowledge and experiences in order to improve their working situation. I draw upon these insights to highlight how worker-centric approaches to digital mobility platforms can contribute to more inclusive and sustainable cities.","Kuttler, Tobias",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,URBAN STUDIES,alternative platform models,embeddedness,platform mobilities,platform urbanism,South Asia,,,,,,,JUL 2024,Urban mobilities in Mumbai: Towards worker-centric platformisation beyond 'urban solutionism'

The integration of multimodal data, especially from public transportation (PT) systems like subways, plays a critical role in enhancing the precision of these predictions. However, current data-driven models often overlook the direct integration of public transport checkout data.To address this gap we propose a novel deep learning approach: the Multi-Channel Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (MC-STGCN) with a novel loss function Weighted Normalized Mean Absolute Error (WNMAE). MC-STGCN uses an infrastructureaware adjacency calculation that factors in cycling and walking times between stations but also provides a learnable adjacency matrix with local and global attention. Additionally, we formalize robustness measures notably the in-city generalizability, essential for adapting to rapid changes and expansions in urban micromobility networks. For high-demand stations, the MM-PT model effectively captures significant morning and evening peaks, At low-demand stations, the MM-PT model significantly outperforms the baseline STGCN, reducing MAE by 20% and handles week days distribution shifts effectively.

For this, we carried out three in-depth case studies of cities where private companies had deployed shared mobility services: Bogota, Colombia; Paris, France; and Los Angeles, USA. We found that there is a wide range of goals (34 distinct goals) that the governments of these cities are pursuing when attempting to regulate shared mobility services. However, only between three and four of these goals tend to dominate most of their actions. We also identified a mix of motivations for the pursuit of these goals: from the public interest of redressing past inequities, to circumstantial motivations such as appeasing the incumbents that have seen their businesses endangered by these new technologies. The academic literature converges on sustainability and equitable access being two of the primary goals to be pursued in transport policy, but our findings suggest that practitioners and policymakers are pursuing a range of other goals that do not fit neatly into these two theoretical categories.","Castellanos, Sebastian","Wright, Katy","Grant-Muller, Susan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,TRANSPORTATION,Shared mobility,New mobility,Smart mobility,Governance,Policy,Goals,,,,,,JAN 2024,Governing shared mobility: a comparison of the public policy goals being pursued in three cities

The framework considers the spatial and temporal levels of transit services, the spatial separation by urban functional areas, the availability of facilities based on the cumulative opportunity method, and the minimum time cost based on dual accessibility. A case study is performed in Hong Kong. The results show that the main problem for rural residents using public transport services lies in walking to transit stops/piers instead of long waits at public transport stops or infrequent services. The map of area-based accessibility shows great variations by urban functional areas. Despite being a highly transit-dependent city, we find huge disparities of accessibility to public facilities within Hong Kong and people living in some rural areas have difficulties in accessing basic services such as education, health care and shopping through public transport. Theoretically, this study reinforces the significance of place-based transport disadvantage and its intricate relationship with urban form.

Row_45,"The determinants of public transport demand are multifaceted, necessitating consideration of various factors that extend beyond the objective aspects of operation. In addition to travel time and costs, it is imperative to comprehend psychosocial factors influencing public transport usage to enhance policies geared toward fostering ridership and sustainable mobility. Empirical evidence suggests that subjective attributes, such as satisfaction and attitudes, exert a discernible influence on travel behavior and the utilization of public transport. Nevertheless, these linkages remain largely unexplored, especially within the context of large public transport networks in cities of the Global South. This paper aims to address this gap by evaluating the impact of demand-side subsidies in the form of travel vouchers on public transport ridership to understand the mediating effect of satisfaction levels according to the users ' socioeconomic characteristics. These satisfaction levels are related to overall satisfaction with transport, employment and educational opportunities, and life. To achieve this, a largescale randomized controlled experiment was conducted in Bogot a, Colombia, involving a sample of frequent public transport users ( N = 1,607). The participants were divided into a treatment group, which received the travel vouchers loaded onto their smart travel cards for four months, and a control group. Hybrid-ordered logit models were employed to estimate the average number of weekly trips undertaken before, during, and after the intervention. The result shows an increase in ridership by the treatment group, which does not solely depend on improved affordability; but is influenced by a complex interplay of socioeconomic factors and shifts in satisfaction levels. This confirmed that travel satisfaction can contribute to increased public transport demand.","Guzman, Luis A.","Cantillo-Garcia, Victor A.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT,Public transport,Satisfaction,Demand-side subsidies,Ordered logit model,Bogota,,,,,,,OCT 2024,Exploring the effects of public transport subsidies on satisfaction and ridership

Row_47,"Transport planning as a formalised profession is relatively young and there is no doubt it has evolved over time. In Europe, Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans reflect a change in emphasis from keeping traffic moving to place- based, people-centric planning. Three new developments of significance present themselves to contemporary transport planning: the collision and merging of the digital age with the motor age; a widespread sense of deep (and possibly deepening) uncertainty about the future; and the imperative to address the climate emergency and decarbonise transport. Taken together, such developments are reflected in the recent notion of Triple Access Planning which sits within a so-called 'decide and provide' paradigm - contrasted with traditional transport planning within the 'predict and provide' paradigm. The world is changing significantly with a strong sense that transport planning needs to change accordingly. This paper draws upon the '7 Questions Interview' technique to explore with 23 practitioners in the UK their experience of transport planning practice over time, their hopes and fears for its future and what could be achieved, and their views on enablers of, and barriers to, positive change. The interviews reveal a strong sense that transport planning can face a Sisyphean (seemingly impossible) task of advocating measures that could push towards realisation of economic, social and environmental aspirations, only to find progress with measure approval and implementation thwarted by perennial challenges including lack of political will and public buy-in. While the three new developments mentioned represent potential catalysts for significant change, such change relies on multiple other factors. These include collaborative cross- sector working, a long-term perspective, appropriate funding and political agency, and enhanced communication skills to win hearts and minds.

Row_49,"Growing cities need new residential areas, which are often either not connected to the existing transport infrastructure or are poorly connected to it. A fast way to connect these areas is the construction of roads. However, this generates a car-depending mobility among the inhabitants, which is in conflict with several sustainability goals. Moreover, the impact of the implementation of new public transport options is only partly known and this fact reduces the willingness to invest in expensive public transport measures. In this work we examine different mobility concepts, including shared mobility, bicycle highways, a high-frequency bus service, suburban trains and car limitations in a new residential area of 2000 households in Berlin, Germany, which is currently under construction. The households and inhabitants are created synthetically using statistical data derived from a survey among the first people moved in. The age and size structure of these households turn out to be different from the neighboring households. Then, we implement all measures in a microscopic travel demand simulation and quantify the potential modal shifts for four different mobility concepts. The results show that weak and short-term mobility concepts show no significant change in mobility behavior. Only highly integrated projects like bicycle highways into the inner city combined with suburban trains can reduce the need for car- dependent mobility. Shared mobility only fills in the gaps for special occasions but not for daily mobility due to the high costs. In a final step we examine the usage of the introduced public transport services and compare the change in the occupation of the buses and trains. Here our work shows that interchanging from bus to subways and suburban trains drastically reduces the attractiveness of public transport. Introducing a new suburban train changes this situation and the whole region shows a drop of 40% of car trips.","Heinrichs, Matthias","Schoene, Stefanie","Geischberger, Jakob","Diaz, Maria Lopez",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF URBAN MOBILITY,City planning,Demand modelling,Public transport,Traffic simulation,Agent based modelling,,,,,,,DEC 2024,Effects of different mobility concepts in new residential areas
Row_50,"Public passenger transport constitutes one of the links in addressing the mobility-accessibilitybinomial in the urban environment; understanding that access to employment opportunities, places of residence or spaces where many of the essential services are offered, depend largely on the material possibilities and circumstances of travel. The objective of this article is to analyze the spatio-temporal scope, that is, the coverage of the public passenger transport service of the city of Formosa. For this, technical criteria (regulatory thresholds) were considered and spatial analysis processes were carried out-executed in a GIS environment-, based on data obtained from primary (field survey) and secondary sources (CNPHyV, 2010). The results show a wide territorial coverage of transport, although with limitations in peripheral areas of the city where access difficulties are observed, especially in sectors far from the service headers; a situation that is also consistent with the dispersed mode of production of urban land. The eva- luation of the travel time using the empirical Bayesian Kriging method, in comparison with interpolation by IDW, has validated both the precision and the reliability of the results obtained using the first technique.","Blanco, Hector Daniel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,REVISTA DE TRANSPORTE Y TERRITORIO,PUBLIC TRANSPORT,COVERAGE LEVELS,GIS,FORMOSA CITY,,,,,,,,JUL-DEC 2024,Spatial (in)equity scenarios associated with public passenger transport in the city of Formosa
Row_51,"Despite the growing literature on equity and accessibility, little attention is placed on the shortcomings of the transport planning process in bridging the gap between research and practice. Urban mobility plans are usually not oriented towards increasing accessibility and reducing inequalities, and transport projects are traditionally selected based on utilitarian approaches that disregard the distributional effects of proposed actions and policies. This is problematic due to several reasons, including the legitimization of political choices that perpetuate existing inequalities. In this paper, we aim to analyze how different distributive principles in ex-ante evaluations may result in quite distinct conclusions in the policy decision-making process, highlighting the many limitations of the most commonly used transport planning toolkits. To do so, we use data from Sao Paulo's mass transit network expansion projects, which shows disparities among the proposed lines regarding their impacts on inequality levels. While some lines consistently contribute to reducing the difference in accessibility between rich and poor or between white and black populations, others increase the city's average, but at the expense of worsening inequalities. The systematic use of inequality metrics in planning procedures might represent significant progress in reducing transport-related inequalities compared to the predominant utilitarian criteria.","Freiberg, German","Giannotti, Mariana","Bittencourt, Taina A.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Transport planning,Social inequalities,Accessibility,Transit equity,Urban mobility plans,,,,,,,APR 2024,"Are mass transit projects and public transport planning overlooking uneven distributional effects?

Nudging refers to subtle changes in the choice architecture that can influence decisions without imposing restrictions or economic incentives. However, its application in promoting public transportation remains inadequately explored. This study investigates the effectiveness of various nudging treatments in encouraging a shift towards public transit by employing principles from behavioral economics and goal -framing theory. The study randomly assigned participants to four groups: Emotional Nudging, Normative Nudging, Gain Nudging, and a control group. Findings from stated choice experiments indicated that all nudging treatments positively impact the likelihood of choosing public transit. Notably, Gain Nudging emphasizing health benefits exhibited the most significant effects. The results found that it was personal norms that played an important part in decision -making, and social norms have little effect on the likelihood of choosing public transit.

Row_54,"Including pedestrians in urban design is vital so that they prefer walking over motorized transport. Motorized mobility, which mainly involves automobiles, has conditioned urban design, pedestrian movement, sustainability, and urban resilience. Studies of walkability in cities have recently been conducted, and they can be classified into those that use a qualitative observer-perception-based approach and a second approach based on the measurement of observable variables. This work aims to develop a tool that allows for walkability in public spaces to be evaluated based on directly observing reality while considering both approaches: those related to perceiving the environment and physical reality. Walking is one of the main ways of moving around and achieving sustainable urban mobility. The conditions of public spaces are fundamental for people in their preference for moving around by walking. A literature review related to walkability revealed that previous works included a variety of viewpoints, scales, tools, variables, and approaches. This study included a developed tool by modeling a definition of working areas, processing walkability data, and determining the Walkability Index (WI). The reliability of the data observed from the walkability variables was verified, and the tool's usefulness for urban planning was demonstrated. Pedestrian-centered urban design promotes cities' sustainable mobility, sustainability, and resilience. People's conduct reveals how the urban environment is perceived. The developed WI evaluates the existing reality and allows for its evolution to be monitored.","Ros-McDonnell, Diego","de-la-Fuente-Aragon, Maria Victoria","Ros-McDonnell, Lorenzo","Cardos, Manuel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,URBAN SCIENCE,pedestrian,urban management,urban resilience,sustainable mobility,walkability,,,,,,,JUN 2024,Toward Resilient Urban Design: Pedestrians as an Important Element of City Design
Row_55,"This paper analyses the integration of social considerations into public transport planning. It addresses the challenge of balancing social benefits against objectives such as efficiency and cost minimization. Through a literature review, this paper examines methods for assessing public transport accessibility for potentially disadvantaged groups and identifies knowledge gaps in existing research. The analysis reveals a predominant focus on post-implementation (ex-post) accessibility assessments and a lack of research examining potential impacts (ex-ante) during planning stages. Furthermore, the paper identifies a lack of research on how to weigh social benefits against other more conventional objectives such as efficiency and cost minimization and also against environmental considerations. Research usually proposes changes ex-post based solely on a desire to improve accessibility for potentially disadvantaged groups. Therefore, there is a need for more research on how to manage conflicting interests in planning, for example through composite methods. The paper also highlights the tendency of research to overlook the practical usability of methods developed. The relevance of methods to policy makers and planners responsible for planning public transport systems remains largely unexplored. To develop practically useful methods, research needs a better understanding of the norms governing planning practices. It is common to discuss how the mobility needs of potentially disadvantaged passenger groups should be met in isolation from policy contexts. More research is needed about how the potential tensions between social, economic, and environmental considerations play out in public transport planning practices. All of this leads to a risk of a theory-practice gap, marked by a disconnect between research and the practical needs of the public transport providers. By proposing a more nuanced research approach that better reflects the complexity of real-world planning and the different needs of user groups, research can enable public transport planning for what we term 'sustainable accessibility'.","Hrelja, Robert","Levin, Lena","Camporeale, Rosalia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,EUROPEAN TRANSPORT RESEARCH REVIEW,Public transport,Planning,Equity,Accessibility,Assessment,Methods,,,,,,JUL 29 2024,"Handling social considerations and the needs of different groups in public transport planning: a review of definitions, methods, and knowledge gaps"

This paper aims to unpack the causal implications of the motorbike ban, with an emphasis on elucidating potential transformations in urban mobility patterns and public sentiment in Hanoi. The research methodology is rooted in an mixed-methods approach. It begins by applying Spatial Propensity Score Matching (SPSM) to a bespoke transport survey to mitigate geographical confounding in the identification of the ban's causal effects on societal attitudes and behaviours. Subsequently, it applies Ordinal Logistic Regression to quantify the causal influences of diverse socio-economic and demographic factors on public opinion towards the motorbike ban. Together, these methods yield a robust analysis of the policy's prospective impacts. Through this framework, the study provides insights into the key factors influencing individual's opinion on controversial transport policies, such as the motorbike ban in Hanoi.

While models predicting the shift towards public transport are commonly applied in developed countries, there is a lack of similar studies that construct these models in developing countries. In addition, in some developing countries, the motorcycle is one of the main private motorised travel modes. Therefore, the modal shift from motorcycles to public transport in Southeast Asia to reduce private mobility is one of the important topics to examine. This paper presents a systematic literature review, utilising a comprehensive search strategy across electronic databases and reputable sources to identify directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), revealing factors influencing the choice and intention to shift to public transport.

Row_61,"Rural areas typically register low accessibility. This fact negatively affects their attractiveness, the well-being of their population in general, and population subgroups with limited access to private cars or strong space-time constraints (like minors, the elderly or members of large households). Collective autonomous vehicles (AVs) might improve this situation, e.g. by enhancing standard line-based services or introducing alternative shared schemes. Nevertheless, the collective usage of AVs in rural transport and their potential impacts on accessibility are still underexplored, with most research focused on the urban context. This study aims to fill this gap by analysing the public transport accessibility impacts that five alternative AV supply scenarios might generate in the rural valley of M & uuml;hlwald (South Tyrol, Italy). To this end, a variant of the standard space-time accessibility model developed by the authors is used. This focuses on accessibility by public transport specifically, and measures it to both fixed activities and discretionary opportunities. Accessibility impacts are first estimated at the person-based level for a sample of residents. Then, they are aggregated for the whole sample and six subgroups that tend to experience more substantial accessibility issues based on the literature. Results show that line-based AV applications provide limited accessibility benefits. Conversely, time-flexible applications like ride-shared vans or combinations of line-based trunks and on-demand feeders over peak and off-peak hours may provide the most evident advantages, especially for the subgroups with the tightest space-time schedules. Although these results do not reflect other possible impacts of AVs (e.g. environmental effects), they provide policymakers with valuable insights into the collective AV usages that could be most suitable in the rural context regarding personbased accessibility gains.","Dianin, Alberto","Gidam, Michael","Ravazzoli, Elisa","Stawinoga, Agnieszka Elzbieta","Hauger, Georg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION,Autonomous vehicles,Public transport,Rural dwellers,Individual accessibility,Subgroup analysis,,,,,,,2024,Individual accessibility impacts of public transport automation on (groups of) rural dwellers
Row_62,"Electric scooters (e-scooters) have changed urban mobility by offering a dynamic solution to the critical ""first and last mile"" problem, connecting individuals from their homes to public transport and their final destinations. Despite their growing popularity, e-scooters navigate through a landscape of shifting legal frameworks, highlighting the urgency for policies that not only harness their potential but also address their inherent challenges. This study aims to shed light on the intermodal practices and demographics of e-scooters users in Barcelona, explores the potential impacts of regulatory changes on established transport habits, and assesses the adaptability of users to changing transportation options. Through a self-reported survey of 311 private e-scooter users, we find a notable prevalence of young men from lower socioeconomic backgrounds engaging in intermodal travel, primarily for employment purposes. To better understand how e-scooter riders integrate the device in their daily mobility strategies, we introduce the Intermodality Ratio (IR). A Generalized Linear Model (GLM) is then used to identify key demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic predictors of the IR, revealing place of residence as the most significant factor influencing intermodal behavior. Finally, we analyze participants' anticipated behavioral shifts in response to the upcoming ban using a Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) model, which explores the sociodemographic factors affecting the likelihood of adopting alternative transport strategies. These findings contribute to the limited understanding of e-scooter utilization and intermodal practices, particularly within the context of public transit, offering insights into how transport policies can more effectively accommodate emerging mobility solutions.","Roig-Costa, Oriol","Miralles-Guasch, Carme","Marquet, Oriol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION,E-scooter,intermodality,policy restriction,public transportation,stated preferences,,,,,,,DEC 1 2024,Disrupted intermodality: Examining adaptation strategies to public transport e-scooter bans in Barcelona

The findings suggest that women's mobility is characterized by majority trips to the urban area, distinguished using motorized means.

Using Normalization Process Theory (NPT), our analysis of 19 semi-structured in-depth interviews with stakeholders focused on three key areas: making sense of safety of women on public transport; working towards women's safety on public transport; and monitoring the progress of safety initiatives. We found that public transport is delivered by multiple stakeholders, with individual and combined organizational and relational complexity. Participants highlighted the importance of leadership and the need for an overarching strategy for women's safety. Macro-level organizational and environmental barriers to implementing safety initiatives include a lack of proactive, consistent, and collaborative approaches. Differing understandings of what women's safety means can lead to conflicting strategies among organizations, but there are opportunities to develop and integrate enhanced and conceptually consistent training and policies in response to women's safety.

This systematic review assesses the impact of interventions in transportation, housing, and urban development on the mobility of older adults. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, PsycINFO, and SocINDEX up to July 2022 to identify studies that evaluated the impact of transportation, housing, and urban development interventions on older adults ' mobility. Only randomised controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies with control groups were included to establish a causal relationship between interventions and mobility outcomes. Findings: We included a total of 15 studies, of which six were randomised controlled trials. Included studies were conducted in high-income settings and employed diverse metrics to assess mobility outcomes. Among housing interventions, three studies examined the impact of assistive technology within home environments for frail older adults. Two of these interventions maintained functional status without improvement, while the third showed a significant decline in outcomes, with the control group faring even worse. Public transport interventions, focused on enhancing mobility through educational initiatives and policy revisions, consistently produced positive outcomes. Interventions related to driving training for older adults, including in-class and on-road assessments, demonstrated beneficial effects. Results from studies evaluating urban design interventions were more varied, with some enhancing mobility by making public spaces more accessible for older adults and others yielding mixed results following infrastructure changes. Interpretation: Interventions in the built environments of older adults, specifically targeting transportation, housing and urban development, have the potential to enhance mobility and related outcomes according to rigorously designed quantitative evaluations. Due to heterogeneity in how mobility is conceptualised in the literature, greater harmonisation in measurement of mobility would help us understand how the social and built environment contribute to maintaining and improving mobility in older adults.

This study investigates user satisfaction with bus services in Tangier, Morocco, and Oviedo, Spain-two medium-sized cities representing contrasting socioeconomic and cultural contexts. The objective is to assess bus service attributes by identifying and comparing them between the two cities to improve the quality of public transport services. The comparison also highlighted the two cities' different socioeconomic and cultural contexts. The research was based on customised surveys that collected 1,271 answers from bus users in Tangier and 970 in Oviedo. Then, an analytical method was applied, integrating Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA). These methods were used to determine key factors affecting user satisfaction and to evaluate the importance and performance of various service attributes. The relevant factors identified were comfort, accessibility, ticket pricing, and service information. Significant differences in user perceptions were identified. Oviedo excels in comfort, service information, and accessibility, reflecting the maturity of its public transport system. While showing higher satisfaction with ticket prices, Tangier has a younger population that relies heavily on public transport for daily needs. In contrast, Oviedo has a broader age range of users and a higher proportion of women and elderly passengers. Additionally, Oviedo faces challenges in service frequency and availability on weekends and holidays. The analysis suggests that insights from Oviedo's system can improve service quality in Tangier by adapting best practices to local conditions.

Row_68,"Recent decades have witnessed noticeable demographic changes around the world. The global population has continued to increase steadily and, according to forecasts, the trend will be maintained in the coming decades. An increase in the 60+ population is yet another important demographic change. These determinants pose new challenges for socio-economic, spatial, and transport policies in most, if not all, cities in the world. These policies should be aligned with the global development paradigm to promote sustainable development and sustainable improvement of the quality of life of the present and future generations. In the coming years, the potential of cities should be recognized, resources should be managed rationally, effective spatial policies should be implemented, and user-friendly spaces should be created to promote the development of effectively managed urban areas. Cities are often compared to living organisms, which is why social mobility is a crucial determinant of urban development and is often used in assessments of cities. To address the above needs, a universal and innovative methodology for assessing the age-friendly walkability (AFW) of urban public spaces was developed and tested in the present study. The methodology was developed based on a review of the current trends in age-friendly cities, a survey of the target population, and a self-designed concept for evaluating the walkability of pedestrian routes in public space. The proposed methodology not only contributes to the existing knowledge but also has practical implications because it was tested in a Polish city to classify the 15 minute walkability of pedestrian routes and to identify Strategic Intervention Areas for the 60+ population (SAI 60+). This innovative approach to walkable urban public spaces is a simple tool for developing senior-friendly planning solutions in cities.

Row_69,"The scope of the research work described in this article involved identifying the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the urban public transport system in a medium-sized city and its adjacent metropolitan area, using as reference information the number of tickets effectively sold in order to determine the fluctuation in the volume of passengers on the different bus lines before, during and after the pandemic. At the methodological level, a combined approach was employed, involving, on the one hand, the collection of open access public data from institutional repositories and information provided by the government and, on the other hand, network analysis and graphical mapping using GIS tools. The results obtained at the micro level (individualised study of each urban bus line) reveal a significant decrease in the number of passengers during the pandemic, showing the effect of mobility restrictions and the fear of contagion. However, a gradual recovery in post-pandemic demand has been observed, highlighting a large variability in recovery patterns between different bus lines. Such a situation could be attributable to several factors, such as the socio-demographic characteristics of the areas served, the frequency of the service, connectivity with other modes of transport and users' perception of the quality of the service. At the macro level (comparison between urban and interurban transport), lines with higher demand prior to the pandemic have shown greater resilience and faster recovery. However, urban transport has experienced a more uniform and accelerated recuperation than interurban transport, with significant percentage differences in the years analysed. This disparity could be explained by the greater dependence of inhabitants on urban transport for their daily trips, due to its greater frequency and geographical coverage. Interurban transport, on the other hand, shows a more fluctuating demand and a lower dependence of users. Finally, the lack of previous research focused on the impact of the pandemic in sparsely populated rural areas restricts the ability to establish a solid frame of reference and generalise the results of this study.

Row_70,"Existing research underscores substantial gender-based variations in travel behavior on public transit. Studies have concluded that these differences are largely attributable to household responsibilities typically falling disproportionately on women, leading to women being more likely to utilize transit for purposes referred to by the umbrella concept of ""Mobility of Care"". In contrast to past studies that have quantified the impact of gender using survey and qualitative data, we examine a novel data-driven workflow utilizing a combination of previously developed origin, destination, and transfer inference (ODX) based on individual transit fare card transactions, name-based gender inference, and geospatial analysis as a framework to identify mobility of care trip making. We apply this framework to data from the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Analyzing data from millions of journeys conducted in the first quarter of 2019, the results of this study show that our proposed workflow can identify mobility of care travel behavior, both in terms of (1) detecting times and places of interest where the share of women travelers in an equally-sampled subset (on basis of inferred gender) of transit users is 10 %-15 % higher than that of men, and (2) finding women significantly more likely to exhibit a consistent accompaniment patterns with riders who are children, elderly, or people with disabilities. The workflow presented in this study provides a blueprint for combining transit origin-destination data, inferred customer demographics, and geospatial analyses enabling public transit agencies to assess, at the fare card level, the gendered impacts of different policy and operational decisions.","Abdelhalim, Awad","Shuman, Daniela","Stewart, Anson F.","Campbell, Kayleigh B.","Patel, Mira","Pincus, Gabriel L.","de Madariaga, Ines Sanchez","Zhao, Jinhua",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION,Mobility of Care,Women in Transit,Public Transport,,,,,,,,,2024,Inferring mobility of care travel behavior from transit smart fare card data
Row_71,"This study explores the '15 -minute city' concept in Hamilton, New Zealand, focusing on challenges related to car dependency and urban sprawl. Triggered by the greater emphasis on sustainable urban environments following the global pandemic, the research employs a mobility -based approach to assess the model's applicability across various urban districts. Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping is used to identify 'liveable areas' in business, residential, and industrial districts where essential services are accessible within three different thresholds of 5, 10, and 15 min walking distance. This tiered approach offers a detailed view of urban accessibility, highlighting the practicality and varying implementation levels of the 15 -minute city concept across diverse urban areas. Geolocated mobile phone data from 88,660 residents is analysed with a focus on 'inflow' and 'outflow' travel distances at both city and district levels. While the results reveal the practical challenges of implementing the '15 -minute city' paradigm, they also show partial alignment of Hamilton's urban fabric with the paradigm, offering scope for adjustments to better suit the city's specific characteristics and residents' behaviours. The study highlights opportunities for enhancing the diversity and accessibility of amenities and improving public transportation and alternative transport options, all key factors for sustainable urban development. This adaptable methodology serves as a valuable reference for other cities in developing strategies for sustainable living. The study concludes that while Hamilton shows potential for transformation, a nuanced and locally focused approach is crucial. These insights contribute to the current new urbanist literature by providing a comprehensive city -district perspective, extending the discourse to include distances beyond the '15 -minute city' and highlighting areas where further urban planning or intervention is necessary.","Wang, Tianyi","Li, Yan","Chuang, I. -Ting","Qiao, Weijie","Jiang, Jing","Beattie, Lee",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,CITIES,15-Minute-city,Urban structure,Geolocated data,Human mobility analysis,GIS spatial analysis,,,,,,,AUG 2024,"Evaluating the 15-minute city paradigm across urban districts: A mobility-based approach in Hamilton, New Zealand"

Therefore, the development of regionally integrated sustainable transport strategies becomes essential to comprehensively address these concerns. This study aims to bridge this gap by introducing a GIS-supported methodology that combines multiple linear regressions with hazard ratio models to quantify and map the impacts of environmentally driven regional transport policies on air pollution and human health. The main findings of an illustrative case study highlighted the importance of stronger efforts to promote the transition to shared and active transport and address the articulation between urban and rural mobility. This study offers a novel contribution to transport researchers and policymakers by proposing a methodology that (1) forecasts the impacts of regional transport policies using open data and software, ensuring its applicability for diverse regional settings, (2) provides the results in quantitative and visual formats, facilitating output analysis and visualisation and, consequently, decision-making and public consultation on proposed sustainable transport policies, and (3) sets the groundwork for including future transport-related dimensions.","Filipe, Rita Prior","Heath, Andrew","McCullen, Nick","Smith, Theresa",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,SUSTAINABILITY,regional mobility,transport policy,air pollution,human health,sustainable passenger transport,geographical analysis,,,,,,JUN 2024,Forecasting and Mapping the Environmental and Health Impacts of Sustainable Regional Transport Policies

It contributes to a better understanding concerning socio-economic and residential factors affecting modality styles with a specific focus on sustainable travel modes. We examined residents living in the inner city (Kalamaja neighbourhood) and an inner suburb (Priisle neighbourhood). We conducted a modality styles analysis based on smartphone tracking data from 108 people over 14 months. Cluster analysis distinguished five urban modality styles, of which four were dominated by one travel mode (i.e., car, public transport, bike, or walk) while one displayed a multimodal style. Modality styles are fairly evenly distributed in Tallinn, with the walk dominant style representing 32% of all individuals, the car dominant style 27%, the multimodal 23%, the public transport dominant 13%, and the bike dominant 5%. The walk dominant style has the largest share for women, Estonian-speakers, inner city residents, and households that do not own a private car. The car dominant style has the largest share among men, Russian-speakers, inner suburban residents, and households that own a private car. The share of travel modes is more variable over time for active modality styles and more regular for motorized styles. Our discussion includes consideration of the implications of our results from a policy perspective.

Understanding the perceptions and expectations of this population is crucial for improving satisfaction with their journeys, especially when using public transport. The aim of this study was to analyze the constructs that influence the satisfaction and mobility behavior of public transport users on trips to university campuses in small and medium-sized cities in Brazil. A case study was performed, employing a SEM-MIMIC approach to the answers of a questionnaire applied to students, teachers, and support staff of a university in the interior of southern Brazil. Seven constructs affecting satisfaction were identified and the relationships between them were investigated. These were as follows: walking infrastructure, noise, safety, trip to the stop, infrastructure of stops, trip in the vehicle, and service operation. The results revealed that the greatest influence on overall satisfaction was related to the user's experience inside the vehicle and the characteristics of the service. It was also evident that there was a high direct effect of the users' overall satisfaction on their behavior. The study population presented homogeneity, although younger users were less loyal and less likely to recommend the bus to others, while owning a private vehicle improved satisfaction with the operation of the service.","Ruiz-Padillo, Alejandro","de Moraes, Leticia Barcellos","Rhoden, Paula Sandri","de Ona, Juan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT,Academic population,Structural equation model,Developing countries,Public transport,Satisfaction,Socio-economic characteristics,,,,,,DEC 2024,Analysis of the factors influencing university community satisfaction about public transport trips in small and medium-sized cities in Brazil
Row_76,"Mobility as a service, and its associated variants, has been proposed as a method to improve the sustainability of transport systems; however, most of the approaches that have been proposed so far have been unsuccessful or have worsened the situation. The work presented in this paper investigates an intermodal system that combines a ride-pooling service with a public transport network. The system is composed of a dedicated simulator that evaluates the transport scenario and an intermodal dispatcher that optimises the service according to requests, accounting for their time windows. This intermodal approach considers trips with multiple legs, for which either ride-pooling or public transport are used. This study investigates how the batch size and the early dispatching of the last leg, supported by a vehicle reservation strategy, impact diverse demand profiles that range from single-passenger to multiple-passenger requests, while also addressing the critical aspect of fleet size.

Nevertheless, several scholars highlight that their effectiveness in supporting modal-shift from individual mobility is therefore limited without side-interventions on making more difficult, expensive and non-competitive the use of private cars. Similar goals may be achieved through the increasing of sustainable alternatives' attractiveness (effective and easy multi-modal integration reducing travel times, convenient fare policies.) or the reduction of individual cars privileges (urban tolls, congestion charges, controlled or limited access to green-vehicles to urban cores.). Recently, Genoa Municipality has started to evaluate a smart-gate system to border the city center and limit car access. This measure targets several goals: to control vehicles flow, collect data on city users and support modal shift towards public transport and sharing mobility. Moreover this measure should be able to make sustainable alternatives more appealing together with the adoption of a urban MaaS solution (thanks to ""GetUp"" project, currently ongoing) integrating urban parking, PT services and sharing mobility options.

These impacts can manifest through a disruption of social engagement and outdoor activities, which can negatively affect their mobility, overall quality of life, and well-being. This study employs a narrative review approach of 32 academic articles to identify various factors that can affect women's perception of safety in public places and while using public transport. We further selected 21 studies that provide substantive data on the built environment, individual characteristics, and social factors, while also examining their intersectionality. By adopting an intersectionality framework, we evaluated the relative importance of each factor based on its consistency and prominence in previous research and assessed their significance in contributing to women's perception of safety. The findings highlight the importance of urban design and built environment improvements, such as street lighting and walking path conditions, in enhancing women's perceived safety.

Row_79,"We study optimal degree of bus system electrification for Stockholm's longest high-frequency bus line. We evaluate the welfare effects of opportunity and depot charging fleet configurations with batteries charged during dwell times at terminal stations or during the operating pause in the bus depot, respectively. Electric buses (e-buses) significantly reduce carbon and health damaging emissions of transit services. However, e-buses are presently not welfare improving, because their lower external costs do not offset the higher supply costs (e.g., capital cost of charging infrastructures and batteries). Instead, we find that optimising bus fares and frequencies and road pricing is more effective in improving social welfare and carbon emissions. E-buses significantly reduce surplus of bus operators, which thus are reluctant to adopt these technologies without direct public support. Sensitivity analysis shows that: (i) technological developments to substantially reduce capital costs can make e-buses perform well from a social welfare perspective; (ii) efficiency gains obtained in the operation of the service, e.g., by optimizing on-board conditioning systems, but also bus routing and driving style, can have a greater impact on the cost performance of e-bus fleet configurations than simply reducing capital costs. An argument for ebuses is the efforts in coordinating a transition to electrified vehicles, aiming at reducing the risk of futile investments in charging infrastructure.","Giagnorio, Mirko","Borjesson, Maria","D'Alfonso, Tiziana",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,Public transport,Electric buses,Optimal pricing,Transit subsidies,Urban transportation,Road tolls,,,,,,JUL 2024,"Introducing electric buses in urban areas: Effects on welfare, pricing, frequency, and public subsidies"
Row_80,"This paper sheds light on the understudied phenomenon of female two-wheeler riders in Bangladesh, and their everyday negotiations of moto-mobility in patriarchal public spaces. In transportation research, female riders have traditionally been characterized as occupying the pillion seat. By conducting ethnographic observations of two-wheeler training clubs in Bangladesh (Dhaka) and qualitative interviews with female riders, the paper expands the discussion of gender and mobility beyond the usual focus on car and public transport in the Global South, which is critical for planning equitable and inclusive transport policies. Using the motility framework (access, competence and appropriation), this paper unravels the cultural, spatial and social dynamics of women's everyday moto-mobility. Through engagement in women-only training clubs which also serve as gendered social spaces, female riders actively build technical and spatial competence. They opt for safety-conscious approaches in driving behaviour, subverting traditional/masculine notions of dominance and authority. The findings also reveal how young riders subvert families and communities to acquire and ride motorbikes, but still largely conform (and adapt) to social norms to manufacture respectability (following normative sartorial choices, sexsegregated seclusion/purdah). In other words, their resistance is in proportion to how much they can assert themselves without facing negative repercussions from communities and society at large. As their presence and performances of micro-subversions rewrite spatial geographies (of risk and respectability), this has implications for reshaping the everyday transport geographies of women in urban public spaces. By presenting gender scripts as an element of appropriation in the constant negotiation of mobility, this paper contextualises motility in a nonwestern setting, and shows how multiple (seemingly contradictory) gender performances can feed into each other and regroup to facilitate women's access (to mobility) and rights in a gendered city.","Mowri, Seama","Bailey, Ajay",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Gendered mobilities,moto-mobility,Dhaka,Respectability,Inclusive,,,,,,,MAY 2024,Riding the change: Exploring women's navigation of risk and respectability through two-wheeler mobility in Dhaka

But older people's ability to travel independently and freely to participate in society is crucial for their quality of life. The question of how to maintain mobility equity and equality for older people is, however, a complex one. This is because older people, especially those with disabilities, are often faced with mobility exclusion due to physical barriers around the public transportation and built environment. This has been further intensified as existing mobility accessibility initiatives employed by municipalities have not involved vulnerable groups in society such as older people. Therefore, this study adopts a systematic literature review based on data collected from 83 sources indexed in Scopus and Web of Science database. The findings from this article present factors that influence the local environment in achieving mobility equity and equality from the perspectives of older people, living without and with disabilities.

Row_84,"In recent years, the micromobility and the usage of shared electric kick scooters (e-kscooters) have been constantly growing, especially for systematic and recreational trips in large urban areas. Micromobility might be seen as a well-suited last-mile solution by providing a flexible travel service connection with public transport and MaaS (Mobility as a Service), in general. However, there is a need for implementing adequate regulations regarding safety aspects and shared e-kscooter parking locations, but also for meeting the user requirements. The choice of optimal shared e-kscooter parking locations could help decision-makers to regulate unmanaged dockless shared e-kscooter parking spots that could generate issues for other road users. To this end, in this paper, a novel multi-objective Micromobility Maximal Coverage Parking Location model (M-MCPL) is developed. The model has been solved by applying an elitist Genetic Algorithm that returns the optimal shared e-kscooter parking locations based on the following objective functions: i) the maximization of the population coverage; ii) the maximization of multimodal accessibility coverage (i.e., bus, railway, and metro modes); iii) the maximization of the attraction coverage considering the most relevant points of interest for each corresponding zone in large urban areas. The proposed M-MCPL model has been applied to the case of Rome (Italy) and results suggest priorities for the shared e-kscooter parking locations design. Furthermore, the proposed model is flexible and can be considered as a decision support tool for decision-makers when planning dedicated services in different large urban areas. For that purpose, we conducted the sensitivity analysis by focusing on the single-objective model in which decision-makers might be interested in providing only high accessibility to transport services or maximizing potential demand.","Colovic, Aleksandra","Prencipe, Luigi Pio","Giuffrida, Nadia","Ottomanelli, Michele",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Micromobility,Shared electric kick scooters,Parking location,Sustainable mobility,Multi -objective model,Public transport accessibility,,,,,,APR 2024,A multi-objective model to design shared e-kick scooters parking spaces in large urban areas

Integrating shared micromobility with public transit offers opportunities to complement fixed-route transit networks and address first- and last-mile issues. To explore this topic, a systematic literature review was conducted to consolidate knowledge, analyze research achievements and best practices, and provide future research recommendations. This study examined 108 journal papers from the Web of Science (WoS) core collection from 2016 to 2022, along with grey literature. Citation and co-citation analyses were performed to build and illustrate the literature's bibliometric networks. This analysis categorized the literature into four major study themes: policy, sustainability, the interaction between shared micromobility and public transportation, and infrastructure. The implementation approaches of integrating shared micromobility and public transportation in different cities were classified into four categories: physical integration, payment and fee integration, informational integration, and institutional integration. The findings indicate that the relationship between shared micromobility and public transportation varies with spatial-temporal conditions and the population density of the city. Overall, integrating micromobility into public transit can offer faster and more cost-effective mobility options for most trips, contributing to urban resilience, a better air quality, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and livable communities. Based on these insights, further research is recommended to explore dynamic and context-specific strategies for successful shared micromobility and public transit integration, considering diverse urban settings and demographic factors.","Cui, Can","Zhang, Yu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,SUSTAINABILITY,public transportation,shared mobility,citation analysis,co-citation analysis,urban mobility,,,,,,,MAY 2024,Integration of Shared Micromobility into Public Transit: A Systematic Literature Review with Grey Literature

This paper presents an overview of the IPT sector in the Indian context. IPT in Indian cities has become an indispensable part of the travel pattern in people's day-to-day lives. Census data on travel to work for the year 2011 reveal that 4.31% of the total work trips are done by IPT, which is more than the share of private car work trips. This review paper has made an effort to find answers to the research question: What is the current status and role of IPT in India? The thorough assessment procedure entailed reviewing all relevant research publications available until 2023. Statistical data of the number of registered vehicles and IPT work trips published in government records are studied to understand people's reliance on IPT mode. An effort was made to reflect the shift in trends from traditional IPT vehicles to electric paratransit, namely e-rickshaws. In addition to this, documentation of policy briefs that govern the operation of IPT in India has been done. Authors have also attempted to chalk out multiple policy interventions undertaken abroad to formalize this informal sector of transportation. The examined international case studies consistently emphasize the necessity of establishing a dedicated advisory body for efficient IPT management. Such an entity would oversee paratransit operations in the urban areas, ensuring compliance with both quantity and quality standards.

Crowdedness has therefore increasingly affected decisions such as a place visit via a specific path, the selection of a public transport stop, itinerary, etc., thereby making related information increasingly relevant. The objective of this study is to examine the route and travel choices of pedestrians and public transport users, with the provisioning of travel information related to crowdedness levels. To that end, a choice experiment was designed to elicit travelers' preferences. Discrete choice models were estimated based on data collected from 465 individuals in Greece. Results showed that crowd avoidance plays a significant role in shaping mobility decisions for both pedestrians and public transport users.

Row_92,"Mobility hubs offer a strategic opportunity to enhance multimodal transportation and reduce greenhouse gas emissions within the transport sector. Identifying the spatial factors determinants influencing the usage of mobility hub components is essential for policymakers and transport planners aiming to identify their optimal locations. This study undertakes a systematic literature review and ranking of spatial factors associated with the usage of key on-demand services within mobility hub elements, including bike sharing, scooter sharing, car sharing, ride hailing and taxi and electric vehicle charging stations. Utilising databases such as Web of Science, Google Scholar and Francis & Taylor, we evaluated 119 records, identifying 39 key factors from social and built environments that are associated with usage of the on-demand elements. Key findings highlight the significance of population density, employment density, proximity to public transport, recreational POIs and household income, along with a noted negative association with the factor slope. This research contributes to exploring how these factors align across various on-demand mobility services that can be potentially used for policymakers, and transportation planners in evaluating potential strategies for the optimal allocation and development of mobility hubs.","Geipel, Michel","Martinez-Rico, Beatriz","Buettner, Benjamin","Duran-Rodas, David",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,TRANSPORT REVIEWS,Mobility hubs,built environment,micromobility sharing,car sharing,ride hailing,charging stations,,,,,,NOV 1 2024,Spatial factors associated with usage of different on-demand elements within mobility hubs: a systematic literature review
Row_93,"As the airspace is increasingly gaining importance as a new frontier to improve urban mobility, aerial cable cars are being discussed and already appropriately implemented worldwide to supplement conventional modes of transport in urban areas. Transit planners and designers should carefully consider the interoperability and integration of cable car services with conventional modes of transport. In particular, excessive delays and overcrowding conditions due to deficits in interoperability should be avoided. This challenge of interoperability arises as conventional modes of transport operate predominantly on a timetable, and most cable car technologies operate in such close headways that they can be considered as almost continuous conveyors. The advantage of having almost always a transport vessel of a cable car ready for boarding ceases when large volumes of passengers arrive in batches, for example from higher-capacity modes of transport or at large events, resulting in long queues. Traditional manuals do not yet reflect these aspects of interoperability adequately. Consequently, this work filled this research gap about the interoperability of cable cars related to handling high volumes of incoming passenger arrivals that transfer in larger batches from feeder modes and often result in queues at cable car stations. The following objectives were targeted: (1) determine passenger capacity limits of conventional modes of transport acting as feeders to cable cars and (2) specify space requirements to be provided due to the potential queues that arise. To answer these, methods of Queuing Theory were used and results were placed in Levels of Services of traditional manuals. Key performance indicators included queue length, waiting time, and corresponding queue space. The results revealed that cable cars can be a useful complement to public transit but are of limited feasibility due to cumulative queues at arrival rates with larger crowds. High-capacity feeder modes (e.g., commuter rails) are limited to 20-minute headways depending on cable car technologies. Further, queuing areas of up to 1000 square meters (around 10,800 ft2) should be considered. Several operational limitations are presented as guidance for practitioners and policymakers.","Flesser, Morten","Shalaby, Amer","Friedrich, Bernhard",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION,Aerial cable cars,Aerial ropeway transportation,Public transit,Queuing theory,Waiting time,Intermodal transit,,,,,,2024,Integration of urban aerial cable cars into public transit: Operational capacity limits due to passenger queuing at stations

Row_95,"Introduction: Social inequalities are a day-to-day problem experienced by the most vulnerable populations. In mobility, a basic human need, these inequalities can translate into lower accessibility to basic needs and social exclusion. The mobility barriers and needs of vulnerable-toexclusion (v2e) groups have been documented in the literature, however, issues on accessibility, empathy and awareness strategies and people's attitudes remain. Serious games -fun teaching tools- have been successfully applied in urban/transport planning and have also been used to increase empathy and prosocial behavior. Despite the application of serious games in multiple fields pertinent to this study, the pressing mobility and accessibility issues faced by vulnerable populations have not been addressed in any serious game to date. This study focuses on creating and evaluating a serious board game (EmPATHs) to raise awareness and empathy towards v2e groups among various stakeholders while being fun at the same time. Method: In this case, the goal of the game is to reach as many destinations as possible by playing different v2e personas. The winner of the game is the player who has reached the most destinations at the end with different v2e personas. EmPATHs targets university students from mobility-related programs, the general public, practitioners and decision makers from related fields. The game was created following a four-step iterative design process involving four categories of participants' groups, namely, frequent board game players (gamers) and experts on accessibility, mobility justice, and serious games. The game's evaluation was based on the answers of 26 players and focused on characteristics of serious games and the main goal of the game. The evaluation methodology included close-ended questions to assign a score from 1 to 5 to the established criteria and open-ended questions to complement with the quantitative results. Results & conclusions: The participants considered EmPATHs to be a fun (4.4/5 score) and engaging (4.5/5 score) game, with a medium difficulty level (2.5/5 score) and which does not evoke frustrating feelings (2.0/5 score). The participants acknowledged learning more in-depth about barriers of v2e people (4.5/5 score) and recognized the game's capacity to raise awareness (4.5/5 score). They also felt more likely to empathize with v2e groups after the game (4.5/5 score). Future applications of the game can be expected to be in teaching contexts, public mobility-related events, and workshops with stakeholders from the planning and designing field.","Navarro-Avalos, Fernanda","Nichols, Aaron","Jehle, Ulrike","Buettner, Benjamin","Duran-Rodas, David",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT & HEALTH,serious game inclusion equity,Mobility justice accessibility,,,,,,,,,,SEP 2024,EmPATHs - A serious board game to raise awareness and empathy towards vulnerable-to-exclusion groups in mobility
Row_96,"The urban landscape of Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, faces significant mobility challenges, primarily stemming from rapid urbanization, overpopulation, and outdated infrastructure. These challenges necessitate the exploration of modern smart mobility concepts to improve traffic flow, road safety, and sustainability. This study investigates the potential of solutions such as Mobility-as-a-Service, car sharing, micro-mobility, Vehicle-as-a-Service, and electric vehicles in addressing these challenges. Through a comparative analysis of global implementations, this research identifies key success factors and barriers that inform the feasibility of integrating these solutions into Kinshasa's unique socio-political and infrastructural context. The study presents a conceptual framework, supported by stakeholder analysis, for adapting these solutions locally. A detailed feasibility analysis considers technological, economic, social, environmental, and regulatory factors, offering a clear roadmap for implementation. Drawing on lessons from cities facing similar urban mobility challenges, the paper concludes with actionable recommendations and insights for policymakers and urban planners in Kinshasa. This research not only highlights the viability of smart mobility solutions in Kinshasa but also contributes to the broader discourse on sustainable urban development in rapidly growing cities. While smart mobility studies have largely focused on cities with developed infrastructure, there is a gap in understanding how these solutions apply to cities like Kinshasa with different infrastructural and socio-political contexts. Previous research has often overlooked the challenges of integrating smart mobility in rapidly urbanizing cities with underdeveloped transportation systems and financial constraints. This study fills that gap by offering a feasibility analysis tailored to Kinshasa, assessing smart mobility solutions for its traffic congestion and road safety issues. The smart mobility solutions studied-Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS), car sharing, electric vehicles (EVs), and micro-mobility-were chosen for their ability to address Kinshasa's key mobility challenges. MaaS reduces reliance on private vehicles, easing congestion and improving public transport. Car sharing offers affordable alternatives to vehicle ownership, essential in a city with income inequality. EVs align with sustainability goals by reducing emissions, while micro-mobility (bikes and e-scooters) improves last-mile connectivity, addressing public transit gaps. These solutions are adaptable to Kinshasa's context and offer scalable, sustainable improvements for urban mobility.","Kayisu, Antoine Kazadi","Mikusova, Miroslava","Bokoro, Pitshou Ntambu","Kyamakya, Kyandoghere",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,SUSTAINABILITY,smart mobility,Kinshasa,mobility as a service,car sharing,micro-mobility,vehicle as a service,electric vehicles,feasibility analysis,urban mobility systems,,,NOV 2024,Exploring Smart Mobility Potential in Kinshasa (DR-Congo) as a Contribution to Mastering Traffic Congestion and Improving Road Safety: A Comprehensive Feasibility Assessment
Row_97,"Urban and transportation policies are increasingly recognized for their potential to mitigate climate change impacts and address transport externalities. Amidst efforts to shift modal preferences and reduce transport emissions, cities are turning to spatialbased policies, such as Superblocks, to reshape urban mobility. This research examines the electoral outcomes associated with the implementation of Superblocks in Barcelona, focusing on their impact on political support for Barcelona en Com & uacute; (BEC) during the local elections of 2015 and 2023. Utilizing a combination of adjusted difference-in-differences and propensity score matching methods, we assessed the public's electoral response to the Superblock initiative amidst a backdrop of declining city-wide support for BEC. Our findings reveal that Superblock areas demonstrated significantly stronger support for BEC, suggesting a political premium for the party responsible for these urban interventions. Specifically, electoral support in Superblock districts saw an increase of 10-14% compared to the rest of the city. This result highlights the potential of urban transformation policies to influence political preferences locally and potentially validate the use of local electoral data as a tool for evaluating public response to highly contested urban policies.","Marquet, Oriol","Nunez, Marta-Beatriz Fernndez","Maciejewska, Monika",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL,Superblocks,Electoral analysis,Urban policy acceptability,Sustainable urban planning,Policy evaluation,,,,,,,JUL 2024,The political price of superblocks.

Using over 40 interviews with local residents, business owners and staff, planners, and private sector developers in each city, we found that transportation improvements have created unequal transport mobilities. In both cities, new transportation infrastructure did not improve travel times or access to transit for existing users; in Kitchener, local changes to make way for the new LRT had negative effects on the neighborhood, and bus transit times increased, while in Malmo bus services remained the same as the new train was barely used. This detachment of transportation needs from infrastructure is necessary for local and state politicians to promote new infrastructure as a branding approach.

The sample was drawn from 369 university students. An extended UTAUT model was established with additional hedonic motivation, perceived safety, and personal innovativeness constructs. Findings revealed that perceived safety and performance expectancy were the strongest determinants of behavioral intention to use AVs. On the other hand, social influence and hedonic motivation were the main drivers of UAM acceptability. Furthermore, personal innovativeness was a strong factor when estimating the utilitarian value in both models. The findings could guide the politicians, scholars, and stakeholders of the AV and the UAM market.","Yavuz, Yigit Can",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,JOURNAL OF AIR TRANSPORT MANAGEMENT,Autonomous vehicles,Urban air mobility,Advanced air mobility,Autonomous passenger drones,UTAUT,Technology acceptance,,,,,,MAR 2024,Exploring university students' acceptability of autonomous vehicles and urban air mobility

Row_101,"Air quality and urban mobility are complex socioenvironmental issues faced by megacities, particularly those in the Global South. Investments in efficient and inclusive public transport networks, as well as encouraging active transport modals, can mitigate both traffic congestion and air pollution, leading to improved quality of life. Few studies have integrated the potential effects of a well-developed rail network in influencing modal choice - from motorised to active transport - and their impacts on pollutant emission and air quality through dynamic air quality models. In the megacity of Sao Paulo, the expansion of the subway system has not achieved the planned targets, as intended by state government plans. This induces the question ""What would have happened to air pollution if planned stations had been properly implemented?"" which this paper aims to answer, through the increased adoption of cycling or walking to and from railway stations. We applied the WRF-Chem air quality model to model the effects of railway development in a megacity, focusing on criteria pollutants. Results show that the more investments there are in public transport, by expanding the metro system, the more expressive are the decreases in air pollution, and the farther these benefits spread out spatially. More intense reductions in pollutant concentrations are predicted to occur near the new stations' buffers, but citizens living far from the metro stations will also benefit from these improvements. Additionally, modal change from car to walking/ cycling and subway in all trips within a radius of 1.3 km centered in existing and planned stations is expected to result in a decrease of 11.7 % in CO 2 eq vehicular emissions. Therefore, improvements in public transportation could help improving environmental and social justice, leading to better air quality and transport accessibility, decreasing public health problems and costs, while helping cities reach their GEE emissions reduction targets.","Chiquetto, Julio Barboza","Machado, Pedro Gerber","Mouette, Dominique","Ribeiro, Flavia Noronha Dutra",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,Urban mobility,Air pollution,Sao Paulo,Air quality modeling,Urban environment,Transportation planning,,,,,,OCT 1 2024,Air quality improvements from a transport modal change in the Sao Paulo megacity
Row_102,"Introduction: Current urban and transport planning practices have significant negative health, environmental, social and economic impacts in most cities. New urban development models and policies are needed to reduce these negative impacts. The Superblock model is one such innovative urban model that can significantly reduce these negative impacts through reshaping public spaces into more diverse uses such as increase in green space, infrastructure supporting social contacts and physical activity, and through prioritization of active mobility and public transport, thereby reducing air pollution, noise and urban heat island effects. This paper reviews key aspects of the Superblock model, its implementation and initial evaluations in Barcelona and the potential international uptake of the model in Europe and globally, focusing on environmental, climate, lifestyle, liveability and health aspects. Methods: We used a narrative meta -review approach and PubMed and Google scholar databases were searched using specific terms. Results: The implementation of the Super block model in Barcelona is slow, but with initial improvement in, for example, environmental, lifestyle, liveability and health indicators, although not so consistently. When applied on a large scale, the implementation of the Superblock model is not only likely to result in better environmental conditions, health and wellbeing, but can also contribute to the fight against the climate crisis. There is a need for further expansion of the program and further evaluation of its impacts and answers to related concerns, such as environmental equity and gentrification, traffic and related environmental exposure displacement. The implementation of the Superblock model gained a growing international reputation and variations of it are being planned or implemented in cities worldwide. Initial modelling exercises showed that it could be implemented in large parts of many cities. Conclusion: The Superblock model is an innovative urban model that addresses environmental, climate, liveability and health concerns in cities. Adapted versions of the Barcelona Superblock model are being implemented in cities around Europe and further implementation, monitoring and evaluation are encouraged. The Superblock model can be considered an important public health intervention that will reduce mortality and morbidity and generate cost savings for health and other sectors.","Nieuwenhuijsen, Mark","de Nazelle, Audrey","Pradas, Marta Cirach","Daher, Carolyn","Dzhambov, Angel M.","Echave, Cynthia","Gossling, Stefan","Iungman, Tamara","Khreis, Haneen","Kirby, Nicolina","Khomenko, Sasha","Leth, Ulrich","Lorenz, Florian","Matkovic, Vlatka","Mueller, Johannes","Palencia, Laia","Barboza, Evelise Pereira","Perez, Katherine","Tatah, Lambed","Tiran, Jernej","Tonne, Cathryn","Mueller, Natalie",12,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,Urban planning,Transport,Superblocks,Air pollution,Green space,Urban heat islands,Health,Well-being,,,,JUN 15 2024,"The Superblock model: A review of an innovative urban model for sustainability, liveability, health and well-being"

Recent debates have sought to position urban transition as an incremental process of reconfiguration informed by novel relationships between existing systems of provision and new infrastructural and governing arrangements. We extend these debates by exploring how digital platformisation of urban infrastructure is challenging the organisation and governance of existing urban systems. Bringing together literature on urban transitions with platform urbanism, we focus empirically on the rapid expansion of multiple digital mobility platforms in urban contexts. We ask: in what ways are multiple digital mobility platforms reconfiguring urban public transport systems and who is in control of this process? The paper makes two contributions.

Conventional approaches prioritize car movement, while recent ones emphasize sustainable modes like walking, cycling, and public transport. However, the literature on sustainable street classification remains limited. Hence, this study aims to develop a method for reformulating and evaluating street classification in an urban municipality under sustainability principles. Four scenarios with varying urban centers and street network classifications are developed: a ""do-nothing"" scenario and three backcasting scenarios prioritizing sustainable mobility. The method considers factors such as street width, land uses, current classification, public transport and cycling routes, street continuity, and the quality of the urban environment. A two-dimensional matrix (street significance vs. mode priority) is employed to develop new street categories in the backcasting scenarios, with geospatial and network analysis playing a crucial role. These scenarios are then evaluated using multicriteria analysis (REGIME method), incorporating various urban and transportation criteria. Applied to Kallithea in Athens, Greece, the results show that scenarios proposing new urban centers and readable street classification with traffic calming zones are more efficient. Additionally, they cultivate better conditions for sustainable transportation.

However, literature empirically addressing the individual outcomes of different commuting modes remains scarce. Aim: The core aim of this research was to assess and compare a literature-based set of travel, health, and welfare-related outcomes among three different groups of urban daily commuters: private motorized, public transport, and active commuters. Methods: This cross-sectional study used a nationwide sample of n= 2370 urban daily commuters from all 17 regions of Spain. Participants, aged between 18 and 70, with an average of M= 33 years, were drawn from all 17 regions of Spain, and responded to an electronic survey on commuting issues. Results: As hypothesized, different groups of commuters had different psychosocial trip- and welfare-related outcomes. Indeed, most indicators, except for travel satisfaction, showed a favorable association with the sustainability value attributed to each commuting means. Particularly, active travelers had significantly lower commuting stress and Body Mass Index (BMI) values, and higher rates of life satisfaction and pro-environmental behavior in areas beyond transport, in stark contrast to private motorized users. Public transport users, although 'in the middle' in most aspects, report the highest commuter stress rates. Conclusion: The results of this research endorse the assumption that the commuting mode matters, but the relationship between transport sustainability and user outcomes cannot be understood as 'totally linear'. These insights can be valuable for initiatives aimed at promoting shifts towards more sustainable -and active- transportation patterns among commuters, who constitute an interest group in current mobility planning and decision-making.","Useche, Sergio A.","Llamazares, Francisco J.","Marin, Cristina",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT & HEALTH,Commuters,Active commuting,Health,Psychosocial outcomes,Transport sustainabilizing,,,,,,,SEP 2024,"Good for the planet... and for you too?

The issue of traffic congestion has emerged as a significant global concern due to the expansion of cities in terms of both size and population. Smart mobility encompasses various technological advancements in transportation. This paper evaluates key mobility factors in IoT-based smart mobility systems to establish an efficient and eco-friendly urban ecosystem. The study evaluates various mobility factors such as traffic congestion, pollution level, energy consumption, public transport efficiency, user satisfaction and overall sustainability. The overall sustainability efforts to minimise environmental impact include reducing carbon emissions, energy consumption, and pollution. This research focuses on how IoT can transform urban transportation systems to be more efficient, sustainable, and beneficial to residents, thereby contributing to the broader goal of creating smart, sustainable cities.","Alam, Tanweer","Gupta, Ruchi","Ahamed, N.

Row_114,"There is an ongoing process that greenhouse gas emissions of transport will be incorporated in the European Emissions Trading System. The cap-and-trade approach will result in substantial price increases for fossil fuels which will affect affordability of the transport systems. Within this paper the regressive effect on car-owning households is described in different area categories of the urban and rural region in Germany. Equal-perhousehold redistribution of the carbon revenue could reverse the regressive effect into a progressive effect. However, there is substantial variation within the different economic status groups leaving notable shares of households with a very low economic status without a positive net transfer. This share will be lowest in the metropolises of the urban region and highest in small-sized cities/village areas of the urban and rural region. Particularly in the latter area categories, these households may need temporary mobility allowances due to limited abatement options. Despite the environmental bonus, electric car-owning households still belong to groups of higher economic status, and public transport supply is limited, particularly in the small-sized cities/ village areas of the urban and rural region.","Keuchel, Stephan","Lohrmann, David",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Carbon pricing,Mobility,Equity,Equivalised income,Regional spatial type,,,,,,,SEP 2024,Spatial effects of carbon pricing on transport equity

As demographic shifts and disability prevalence evolve, understanding spatial dynamics affecting accessibility becomes urgent. The research hypothesis suggests that investigating both physical and perceived accessibility realms reveals critical insights into challenges individuals face in public spaces. This study explores public participation methods of different nature to evaluate their effectiveness and complementarity in portraying perceived accessibility in urban spaces. A multi-method approach, integrating participant observation tools like self-completion questionnaires and semi-structured interviews with non-participant technology-driven data sources like Foursquare, Twitter, and Google Places, was employed. The analysis focused on two areas in Alicante, Spain. Findings emerge in four phases: (1) identifying perceived accessible public spaces via questionnaires, (2) discerning influential parameters from interviews, (3) conducting a comprehensive analysis incorporating quantitative and qualitative methods, and (4) establishing correlations between parameters gathered through the methods. The results underscore the importance of diverse public participation methods in urban planning, offering a comprehensive framework for future research to improve accessibility and inclusivity in urban environments.

Row_116,"Mass light -rail transit (LRT) has been promoted as an effective solution toward sustainable transportation in urban areas. This paper presents a micro -simulation framework combining the multi -state supernetwork (MSN) approach and a mobility -related emission module to evaluate the mobility and environmental effects of LRT developments. The evaluation framework considers individuals' mode choice of LRT and particularly the trip chaining with their private vehicles to conduct daily activity programs. As complementary policies to LRT developments, parking pricing and park & ride (P + R) developments are also integrated. The output of daily travel patterns from the MSN approach can be used congruently to calculate the air pollutant emissions. The framework is applied to the extended Metropolitan area of Eindhoven (the Netherlands), where new LRT developments and additional parking policies are considered to improve accessibility and reduce environmental effects. The microsimulation concerns a synthetic population of approximately 110,000 individuals and seven LRT scenarios. The simulation results show a decrease in overall vehicle kilometers traveled and travel time, an increase in public transport use, a decrease in total air pollutant emissions, and an increase in activities in areas around public transport stops and P + R locations. It appears that the inclusion of parking measures in the simulations strengthens the effects, confirming the effectiveness of policy combinations.","van der Waerden, Peter","Cheng, Yuan","Liao, Feixiong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,CASE STUDIES ON TRANSPORT POLICY,Light-rail transit,Supernetwork,Mobility,Environmental effects,,,,,,,,MAR 2024,Evaluating the mobility and environmental effects of light-rail transit developments using a multi-state supernetwork approach

In the transport sector, stakeholders are still dealing with and learning from its consequences, as many users have changed their preferences towards private and less sustainable modes. In this paper, a mixed logit modelling approach was applied to a vast database from a stated preference survey conducted in Germany to assess the influence of COVID-19 on mobility preferences in three different stages of the pandemic period: lockdown (high-risk of spread, May 2020), post-lockdown (medium risk of spread, June 2020), and a period where the number of infected cases was lower (small risk of spread, October 2020). Several variables were included in the analysis, such as sociodemographic characteristics, mobility habits and preferences regarding future mobility solutions. Three models were developed, one for each pandemic stage. A comprehensive and reflective analysis of the models' results, aligned with other studies' findings, shows that the utility of public transport (PuT) and bicycles, based on individuals' sociodemographic characteristics and choice attributes, compared to cars was affected by the pandemic state. Regarding the influence of crowding inside PuT during the different periods, it was concluded that users are more willing to pay an extra for their monthly passes to have available seats in PuT in the latter stage of the pandemic. The availability of dedicated bike lanes and a shower at the destination were considered attractive factors for cycling during the lockdown phase. Regarding the private car use, the cost of parking is the only attribute that demonstrates a causal effect on the preference for using this mode. This attribute holds a greater relevance during the post-lockdown and ""new normal"" periods. The results of this study can be helpful to guide policymakers on the definition of actions to counteract the increasing preference for private transport in the future and during disruptions.","Filgueiras, Manuel","Amorim, Marco","Lobo, Antonio","Couto, Antonio","Kern, Mira","Ferreira, Sara",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,JOURNAL OF URBAN MOBILITY,Mode choice modelling,Stated preferences,Mobility patterns,Willingness-to-pay,COVID-19,,,,,,,JUN 2024,Adapting to the new normal: Understanding public transport use and willingness-to-pay for social distancing during a pandemic context

The authors propose a methodology based on the integration of four components: a case study, an analysis of participatory budget projects, a metadata analysis of bikesharing (BSS) in Szczecin, and a meta plan. They utilized a case study method and conducted a survey based on a custom questionnaire. An analysis of participatory budget projects and data from the operation of bikesharing in Szczecin was performed using statistical methods. Applying the heuristic tool meta plan, they outlined the directions for the development and support of bikesharing as an example of micromobility in Szczecin. The research identified connections between the socio-demographic structure of respondents and attributes of bike communication. This study highlighted periods of intensive system use and locations with the highest exploitation. It showed that the demand for BSS depends on weather conditions, traveler convenience, the density and coherence of bike infrastructure with important locations for residents, transfer connections, and safety.

The research aims to identify the mobility and sociodemographic user profile of bike and e-scooter sharing and understand the key determinants of people's intention to use these modes in the future. To consider the effect of local context on shared micromobility usage, the study exploited survey data (N = 1607) that were collected in three European urban areas (Brussels, Munich, and Vienna). The obtained dataset provided information on respondents' socioeconomic characteristics, mobility capabilities and preferences, including travel frequency by bike and escooter sharing services. The survey also collected information on respondents' likelihood of travelling by shared micromobility in the future. The profile of current users was revealed by conducting a Latent Class Analysis (LCA). The measurement and membership LCA models were estimated based on the mobility and sociodemographic data, respectively. The three-class LCA model uncovered that shared micromobility users are mostly members of the so-called ""Mobility chameleons"" population group whereas few users belong to the ""Car lovers"" and the ""Public transport fans"" classes. Mobility chameleons travel by private, public, and shared modes, as well as by both motorized and active modes. Males, with medium and high income, who own a smartphone, dominate this group. Although mobility chameleons are present in all study areas, their share in the population varies. Regarding potential future usage, people's willingness to travel by shared micromobility in the future is much higher than the present usage levels captured. Modelling the potential demand revealed that while many factors similarly influence the likelihood of travelling by bike and e-scooter sharing, the significance and strength of the effects vary for the two modes.

Public transport services are crucial for meeting this demand, especially for students, who form the most abundant group and are typically captive users of this mode. However, various factors including infrastructure, operation, safety, and environment influence the perception of public transport users regarding their daily trips. Therefore, this case study of a Brazilian university examines the relationships among these factors, using a structural equation modeling approach with multiple indicators and multiple causes (SEM-MIMIC), based on perception data from public transport users within the academic community. The results indicate the importance of incorporating safety perception into travel satisfaction models and considering the interaction between infrastructure and public transport operation attributes. It is also crucial to account for the attributes of the environment in which university students travel. Furthermore, the findings show that user perceptions are influenced by factors such as gender, vehicle availability, total travel time, and the adequacy of the service to cope with specific needs.

In view of this scenario, the aim of this work is to investigate the influence of the circulation and flow of people on public transport in increasing the number of cases of COVID19. The methodology used consisted of a bibliographic review and a comparative spatial analysis of the evolution of the epidemiological situation in Araraquara city, Sao Paulo state, and the trips of the public transport modal. There was a sharp increase in cases of COVID-19 in places with the highest number of trips, mainly in the flows made by public transport. The centralization of these flows to the Central Integration Terminal intensifies the possibility of further contamination. It was possible to infer that the places with the highest growth in the number of cases are contained in the zones with the highest number of origin trips and the places with the highest percentage growth in the number of cases are in the areas with the highest number of destination trips.

Specifically, shared mobility services experienced a shift in demand due to increased concerns about COVID-19 transmission. As we move beyond the pandemic, gaining insights into the evolving travel demand landscape becomes crucial for adapting operations to the new normal of travel behavior. To that end, this study seeks to examine travelers' intentions to adopt shared e-scooters and bikes in a scenario where COVID-19 risk is no longer a prominent factor. To achieve this, survey data were collected in Fall 2022 from three cities in the Midwest U.S. with different sizes, population densities, and maturity of shared mobility services. The survey solicited respondents' opinions about their willingness to adopt shared mobility services in a future scenario.

Findings highlight the positive influence of attitudes, perceived behavioral control, and social norms on intentions to use micro-mobility. Additionally, the study reveals an unexpected positive influence of COVID-19 risk perception on intentions in one of the three cities, presenting an opportunity for service providers to capitalize on the perceived safety of shared micro-mobility in the future.

Therefore, this study applies a mixed method approach: perceptions of and requests for urban green travel environments were explored through public participatory GIS (PPGIS) survey with residents in Copenhagen, and semi-structured expert interviews were used to explore how Danish planners perceive the benefits, barriers, and planning factors for planning urban green travel environments. Residents perceived green spaces as urban green travel environments and requested further greening of the streets. In interviews, planners acknowledged the benefits of planning urban green travel environments.

Row_129,"The transportation industry plays an important role in shaping today's economy and society with a large impact on growth and development. However, the unprecedented outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 and the prompt measures adopted by state governments to contain the spread of the virus drastically reduced services provided by transportation systems. A burgeoning literature is growing already in developed countries evaluating the effect of the pandemic on the transport sector and proposing sustainable measures to cope with future pandemics is underway. Conversely, there is nuanced understanding of the COVID-19 response to the urban transport sector in developing countries of Sub-Saharan Africa where urban population concentration and mobility patterns are at their peak. Though marred by scanty evidence to document and assess the situation in Sub-Saharan Africa, Cameroon represents a useful ""study ground"" to conduct such findings. Using Douala city in Cameroon as a case study, this paper examines the effect of COVID-19 restrictions on (i) mobility patterns, (ii) transport operators and (iii) to provide evidence-based recommendations to transport authorities in responding to future pandemics in the sub-continent. A sample of 190 key informants (taxi drivers, bus drivers and bike riders) were interviewed using questionnaires complemented by focus group discussions with relevant transport authorities notably transport agency operators, transport delegates, traffic police department and transport syndicate leaders. The key findings reveal a drastic decline in passenger demand for public transport during the pandemic period, a drastic reduction in bus/taxi occupancy leading to a steep decline in intra-urban and inter-urban mobility, and a drop in the income situation of bus and taxi drivers. Transport operators lay off workers at bus terminals stemming from low turnovers. The outcome pushes for policy options for extensive collaboration among various transport-related stakeholders, consultation and effective involvement of public transport operators in decision-making that may create sustainable pathways to cope future pandemic waves.","Kuma, Chianebeng Japhet","Ngwah, Chia Elvis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-TRANSPORT,COVID-19,Restriction Measures,Transport Sector,City of Douala,Cameroon,UN SDG 11: Sustainable cities and communities,,,,,,MAR 18 2024,"Impact of COVID-19 restriction measures on transport sector in Sub-Saharan Africa: insights from Douala City, Cameroon"
Row_130,"Background: Based on a chapter in the recently published 3rd edition of Health of the Move, this article summarizes past and current knowledge regarding how gender, health and transport (GHT) interact, and implications for policy and practice in both transport and health spheres. Methods: The chapter, 'Gender, transport and health: Emerging trends and gaps in global research', comprises an extensive review of research on these topics and their intersections in recent decades. It summarizes key concepts from the earliest publications regarding GHT issues and provides insights from 155 scientific articles published between 2000 and 2023. Results/findings: ""Gender"", a socially constructed concept reflecting culture-specific perspectives on the roles of men and women, is often used generically to reflect ""sex"", that is solely the biological differences. Similarly, the assumption that transport is ""gender neutral"" remains a powerful arbiter, particularly within engineering and policy. Key findings are: 1) women's mobilities are significantly affected by violence. There is a need to address its association with hegemonic masculinity through sustained focus on the harmful attitudes and behaviours of this gender identity. 2) Women walk more and cycle less than men with positive and negative impacts to health depending on context. Transport infrastructure safety and accessibility must be improved to ensure women's health is equitably associated with travelling actively. 3) Women are more involved in caring for others than men. A gender-sensitive approach to mobilities must consider care-giving needs throughout the lifecycle. Conclusions: Gender differences in travel are substantial and highly relevant to health equity. Gender-sensitive planning requires fuller integration of walking, cycling and intermodal solutions into regular transport planning, and requires strong policies to make all transport-related spaces accesible. Major gaps appear in research, particularly how hegemonic masculinity is related to road, gender and criminal violence that clearly limits the mobility of specific groups by gender.","Sagaris, Lake","Baker, Lucy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT & HEALTH,Gender,Transport,Health,Equity,Just sustainabilities,Violence,,,,,,NOV 2024,"New challenges arise from consolidation of gender, health and transport research"

Public transport companies usually allocate few financial resources to these areas, providing transport services with low frequency, poor accessibility, poor reliability, and high waiting times at stops. Recently, microtransit has emerged as an effective solution to improve the travel experience in suburban areas, particularly for non-commuting trips during off-peak hours. This paper presents an integrated methodological approach for designing microtransit services to meet the mobility needs of people living in low-density suburbs. By conducting a Reveled Preference (RP) and Stated Preference (SP) survey and developing a travel demand model, the demand was estimated and used as input to simulate and size the service. Combining GIS and simulation models, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were assessed; fleet size to meet the trip requests was identified and the fare was selected using a sensitivity analysis. The method was applied to a real case study to design a new microtransit service with flexible routes and on-demand stops in a suburban area in Palermo, Italy. The results highlight how introducing a microtransit service with 30 nine-seater vans could change the mobility habits of people living in the suburban area, being attractive and financially sustainable if costing 2 , or just a little more than the existing fixed-route bus service. It could improve the travel experience by reducing the average waiting time at stops to around 5 min and improve access to amenities and PT hubs by guaranteeing a walking time of maximum about 8 min.","Capodici, Alessandro Emilio","Citrano, Martina","D'Orso, Gabriele","Migliore, Marco","Ignaccolo, Matteo","Leonardi, Pierfrancesco","Torrisi, Vincenza",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT,Microtransit,Public transportation,Suburbs,Urban transport planning,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,"Designing microtransit services in suburban areas: A case study in Palermo, Italy"

Row_135,"In the rapidly evolving landscape of urbanisation and transportation infrastructure in Bangladesh, it is critical to address the disparities in public transportation access that disproportionately affect vulnerable people such as older adults and people with disabilities. This scoping review aims to synthesise the available evidence and highlight research gaps on unequal access to public transportation and how these inequalities lead to the social exclusion of older adults and people with disabilities in Bangladesh. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta -Analyses, Scoping Review Extension (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines and employed thematic analysis to interpret the findings. Four databases Scopus, Embase, PubMed and Web of Science, and online sources such as Google Scholar and TRID were searched from January 2002 to July 2022. The findings show that the existing modes of transportation are inadequate and non -inclusive and pose both physical (including built environments such as roads, ramps, and footpaths) and social barriers (such as low income, low employment opportunities, and negative social attitude) which reduced the accessibility to workplaces, healthcare, and social networks for these two vulnerable groups. An inclusive and sustainable urban transport infrastructure, older adult -specific and disabled -friendly transportation policies, and behaviour changes are significant steps to improve safety and social inclusion. The transport authorities have ignored the transport necessities of these vulnerable groups and (in)advertently pushed them towards marginalised sections. This study theoretically contributes to the age -friendly city framework for older adults and people with disabilities by adopting an inclusive urban mobility approach for all.","Jahangir, Selim","Bailey, Ajay","Hasan, Md Musleh Uddin","Hossain, Shanawez",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH INTERDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVES,Transport,Accessibility,Older adults,People with disability,Social exclusion,Scoping review,,,,,,JUL 2024,Inequalities in accessing public transportation and social exclusion among older adults and people with disabilities in Bangladesh: A scoping review
Row_136,"The relationship between the built environment and transportation mode choice is well-studied, but less attention has been spent on the way that urban environments influence the relative travel costs for different modes. This paper uses a 'cost-distance' framework to assess the tradeoffs between transportation modes for commuters in the Dublin metropolitan area and employs random forest models to investigate non-linearities in the relationships between relative mobility by mode and built environment characteristics. The results suggest that more 'walkable' built environments increase the efficiency of active transport modes; however, we also find that these environments are negatively related to cost efficiency for public transport, likely due to congestion effects for buses. Beyond these theoretical insights, the results also provide a spatially targeted set of priorities for policymakers looking to improve the efficiency of sustainable transportation modes. These methods could be applied to any global region with access to the requisite data.","Credit, Kevin","O'Driscoll, Conor",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Public transport,Cycling,Walkability,Urban form,Travel time,,,,,,,MAY 2024,Assessing modal tradeoffs and associated built environment characteristics using a cost-distance framework
Row_137,"Introduction: Serious games generate a virtual environment where players are immersed in simulated conflicts, guided by distinct rules. They replicate intricate systems, like transportation, encouraging social engagement via reinforced learning. Unlike preference-based studies, these games offer enhanced real-time feedback on players' actions. Thus, they reveal how user experience and social interaction influence decision-making over time. We use a serious game to study the willingness of travelers to adopt automated mobility, specifically shared modes of transport, an important step toward alleviating congestion, enhancing the quality of urban living, and improving people's health and well-being. Methods: For each scenario, 100 participants were randomly divided into ten groups of ten interacting players. They chose independently out of three automated transportation modes- shared ride, shared car, and automated transit-over 50 simulated days how to commute to work. They aimed to maximize their overall score by arriving punctually, which was influenced by their mode and departure time and the choices of fellow players. Cross-nested logit kernel choice models were estimated based on the game data. Results: In the recurring congestion scenario players learned to adopt the shared ride at the expense of transit; in the nonrecurring congestion scenario, random incidents increased the use of transit and shared car (ride alone). Conclusions: Congested traffic motivated a shift to ridesharing at the expense of private rides and public transport; however, the latter was highly demanded when traffic became unsmooth and travel times more uncertain. The implications can be translated to health promoting polices to encourage sustainable travel behaviors while also improving transportation efficiency.","Etzioni, Shelly","Collins, Mor","Ben-Elia, Eran","Shiftan, Yoram",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT & HEALTH,Automated mobility,Serious games,Game-based model,Discrete choice model,Reinforced learning,Congestion,,,,,,SEP 2024,Behavioral insights on individual and social adaptation to automated mobility using a serious game

Shared micromobility systems, such as bicycle- and scooter-sharing programs, have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional urban mobility challenges. This study delves into the complexity of shared micromobility fleet development, focusing on the interplay between fleet size, user demand, regulatory frameworks, economic viability, and public engagement. By employing a system dynamics modeling approach that incorporates causal loop diagrams (CLDs) and stock and flow models (SFMs), we explore various policy scenarios to optimize micromobility management systems. Our findings reveal that financial incentives, such as fee reductions and government subsidies, significantly increase user adoption and profitability, whereas increased operational fees necessitate a delicate balance between cost management and service attractiveness. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses highlight critical parameters for effective fleet management. This research offers actionable insights for policymakers and operators, promoting sustainable urban transport systems.","Fuady, Shahnaz N.","Pfaffenbichler, Paul C.","Susilo, Yusak O.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,COMMUNICATIONS IN TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH,Shared micromobility,Fleet management,Policy frameworks,Urban mobility dynamics,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,Bridging the gap: Toward a holistic understanding of shared micromobility fleet development dynamics

It identifies the formation of contemporary protocols of transit etiquette as a productive line of scholarly inquiry by taking the transformation of (de)boarding behaviours in Tokyo between the 1880s and the 1960s as a case study. Zooming in on urban railways in the Japanese capital, it describes the processes through which (de)boarding practices grew more elaborate in character and more narrowly defined in terms of the spatio-temporal location at which they could be legitimately exercised. It examines three groups of factors that contributed to this process: ""software"" and ""hardware"" interventions in transport operations as well as their broader historic context. Simultaneously, it cautions against linear narratives of consistent improvement by stressing the contradictions of this process. The article contributes to mobility studies by calling attention to the malleability and socio-technical construction of the norms that guide mundane mobility practices. It provides a provisional template for subsequent historical accounts of transit etiquette, and argues that such studies can empower research on mobilities and transport to contribute to wider debates about (in)civility and the organisation of urban life.","Schimkowsky, Christoph",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,MOBILITIES,Urban mobilities,passengers,public order,cities,manners,Japan,East Asia,,,,,MAY 2024,Towards a history of transit etiquette: the development of orderly boarding practices in Tokyo
Row_140,"Promoting sustainable mobility systems by encouraging the use of the bicycle as a transport mode is now a public policy objective. This political will is also pursued in France where the modal share of cycling is relatively low. However, young people and those with a high level of human capital, such as members of the university community, are observed to be more advanced in their adoption of cycling. An understanding of how cycling is used by university students and staff would therefore help to inform public decision-making and support more efficient targeted policies to develop this mode of transport. Using original data from the MobiCampus-UdL project, the aim of this article is to analyze the determinants of bicycle use by the university community at the University of Lyon, France. Two multivariate logistic regression models are estimated on the subsamples of students and staff: one explaining the probability of using the bicycle as an exclusive mode of transport to get to the campus and the other explaining the probability of using the bicycle in combination with other modes. Our results suggest that while sociodemographic characteristics have little influence within our two relatively homogeneous subsamples, access to mobility resources and the spatial characteristics of the campus and place of residence are crucial. We also find that access to bicycles is an important determinant of the utilization of cycling. Given that the adoption of cycling is still very low, our findings justify policies to increase the availability of bicycles and subsidize their purchase. More specifically, our results suggest that access to a shared bike station on campus encourages the exclusive use of bicycles by students and staff but has no effect when used in combination with other modes. On the other hand, good accessibility to public transport, whether from home or from campus, does not reduce the use of bicycles by either sub-population, either exclusively or in combination. Furthermore, while living far from the city center is an obstacle to the exclusive use of the bicycles, especially for staff, it does not in any way prevent their use in combination with other modes, such as the train. These results open up new avenues for anticipating the development of intermodality between public transport and cycling.","Havet, Nathalie","Bouzouina, Louafi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT AND LAND USE,Home-campus mobility,combined modes,public transport accessibility,bike-sharing accessibility,students,university staff,,,,,,2024,"Bicycle use in the university community: Empirical analysis using MobiCampus-UdL data (Lyon, France)"
Row_141,"The use of cars in cities has many negative impacts, including pollution, noise and the use of space. Yet, detecting factors that reduce the use of cars is a serious challenge, particularly across different regions. Here, we model the use of various modes of transport in a city by aggregating Active mobility (A), Public Transport (B) and Cars (C), expressing the modal share of a city by its ABC triplet. Data for nearly 800 cities across 61 countries is used to model car use and its relationship with city size and income. Our findings suggest that with longer distances and the congestion experienced in large cities, Active mobility and journeys by Car are less frequent, but Public Transport is more prominent. Further, income is strongly related to the use of cars. Results show that a city with twice the income has 37% more journeys by Car. Yet, there are significant differences across regions. For cities in Asia, Public Transport contributes to a substantial share of their journeys. For cities in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, most of their mobility depends on Cars, regardless of city size. In Europe, there are vast heterogeneities in their modal share, from cities with mostly Active mobility (like Utrecht) to cities where Public Transport is crucial (like Paris or London) and cities where more than two out of three of their journeys are by Car (like Rome and Manchester).","Prieto-Curiel, Rafael","Ospina, Juan P.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL,Modal share,Vehicle kilometres travelled,Motorisation,Active travel,,,,,,,,MAR 2024,The ABC of mobility

Results show that such a deployment would be effective in terms of improving accessibility, safety, energy efficiency, employment opportunities, and reducing traffic congestion, but that spatial and temporal contexts play an important role. Moreover, higher community benefits could be reached, and these are the key recommendations, if (i) there is a focus on developing MaaS applications, particularly catering to the booking and shared system needs of disabled individuals, (ii) an expansion of novel mobility services is advanced to areas currently underserved by MaaS, and (iii) MaaS approaches are implemented to further reduce energy consumption, boost employment, and alleviate traffic congestion. The findings have implications for transport users, calling for the introduction of subsidy policies, tax regulations, and redefining public transport to propel MaaS progress.

The paper examines the use of serious games as tools to understand how citizens perceive possible inequalities related to urban mobility and what factors they consider relevant for (re)distributing resources among different social groups experiencing such inequalities. Methods: Two serious games, a classification game and a dictator game, are applied in Santiago de Chile, a city characterised by significant inequalities that affect also transport. The games are tested in seven focus groups involving 33 participants, arranged according to their socioeconomic conditions. In the games, participants have to rank six fictional characters and distribute among them resources to finance their mobility needs. Results: Participants tend to privilege socioeconomic variables such as income, rather than considering other significant individual features or the actual mobility needs of different characters. The resources are distributed focusing on the characters perceived as disadvantaged. Such perception of mobility-related inequalities does not show significant differences between participants from different social backgrounds. Conclusions: Serious games can be helpful to anticipate how the general public may perceive controversial policy measures and to plan measures to avoid discontent, providing relevant elements to enhance the social acceptability of certain transport policy decisions. Their relevance is significant in the face of pressing societal issues, also in relation to health, although their implementation can be quite time- and money-consuming.","Vecchio, Giovanni",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT & HEALTH,Serious game,Inequality,Transport justice,Redistributive policy,,,,,,,,MAY 2024,Serious games and transport justice: Examining redistributive issues through classification and dictator games

This could foster the development of smart city vision in many countries. However, to implement this emergent technology in wider society, public acceptance needs to be addressed. Even though there is a regulation related to drone operation, making people aware is also paramount to ensure that they will perceive the operation of drones as being able to support a better society and will lead to more effective deployment of this technology ecosystem.

The systemic nature of these inequities suggests they will be reproduced even in new, innovative mobility systems intended to solve disparities.

The focus of the analysis is on whether and how the policies used to pilot and implement EMM and other shared mobility systems address equity concerns. Our results reveal that cities at the forefront of piloting EMM systems have provided useful lessons to others further behind the implementation curve. These lessons are of many types, including co-learning with other agencies, conducting research and pilots in advance of developing and enacting EMM policies or service models, and responding to equity demands. Our findings also suggest that policies for EMM devices tend to over-rely on public safety concerns to motivate their enactment. We contend that mobility equity stakeholders should reframe such public safety concerns within broader policy discourses around mobility inequities/injustices and their mitigation strategies, which must be explicitly delineated in the implementation plans and regulations for EMM and other urban shared mobility systems.","Boamah, Emmanuel Frimpong","Miller, Maya","Diamond, Joshua","Grooms, Wes","Hess, Daniel Baldwin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Equity,Justice,Micromobility,Mobility,Policy,Planning,Transport,,,,,FEB 2024,The long journey to equity: A comparative policy analysis of US electric micromobility programs

Nevertheless, the increasing interest from scholars, CS companies' owners, and policymakers in car sharing services as a viable response to the sustainable urban transport has availed rather mixed considerations, thus calling for further scrutiny. The current endeavor thus seeks to advance a systematic literature review of the body of knowledge correlatively addressing the issues of various forms of smart mobility and car sharing. Four major research questions are envisaged, namely: What are the bibliometric characteristics of the literature related smart mobility and car sharing? What is the focus of this literature in terms of key concepts? What are limitations of the existing body of literature? and What are the implications of this literature in terms of future research avenues? With a view to providing pertinent answers, emphasis will be laid on the insights, critique, transformative redefinitions of the literature in the field via a bibliometric analysis and structured theme-based review.

Row_151,"In theory, the unidirectional relationship between perception and behavior has been well established. In this line, the relationship between perceived accessibility and travel behavior has also gained traction in the transport domain. There is, however, less knowledge regarding the dynamic of bidirectional effects between these two variables and (in)consistency over time. Employing the Netherlands Mobility Panel data, we investigate the direction of the (causal) effect between perceived accessibility and travel behavior/travel preference. Using a two-wave crosslagged panel model, we test how this theory works among urban travelers (n = 4,946). The findings show that the relationship between perceived accessibility and travel-related decisions varies depending on the transport mode and whether it is about travel behavior or preference. The effects might show bidirectionality, unidirectionality, or neither. Findings highlight that the perception-behavior theory is primarily consistent with revealed travel behavior as opposed to stated preferences. We find a bidirectional perception-(travel) behavior relationship. Unlike conventional wisdom and commonly used theoretical links, we find that travel mode use has a larger impact on perceived mode-specific accessibility than the reverse effect (the more expected link). Travel behavior also shows consistently lower levels of perception-behavior dissonance than preferences do. The study finds that perception consistently influences public transport use and preferences, unlike for cars and bicycles.

The results demonstrate that technophilia, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are determining factors. Green values and attitudes toward shared modes have a notable total positive effect. However, contrary to expected, attitudes toward public transport, car and bicycle hardly explain the intention to adopt MaaS apps.

This study aims to develop a methodology that applies to any city for the stratification of urban roads by their functionality through only their urban features. It is intended to be a tool to cluster similar streets and, consequently, traffic noise to enable urban and transportation planners to support the reduction of people's noise exposure. Three multivariate ordered logistic regression statistical models (Model 1, 2, and 3) are presented that significantly stratify urban roads into five, four, and three categories, respectively. The developed models exhibit a McFadden pseudo-R-2 between 0.5 and 0.6 (equivalent to R-2 >0.8). The choice between Model 1 or 2 depends on the scale of the city. Model 1 is recommended for developed cities with an extensive road network, while Model 2 is most suitable in intermediate and growing cities. On the other hand, Model 3 could be applied at any city scale but focused on local management of transit routes and for designing acoustic sensor installations, urban soundwalks, and identification of quiet areas. Urban features related to road width and length, presence of transport infrastructure, and public transport routes are associated with increased traffic noise in all three models. These models prove useful for future action plans aimed at reducing noise through strategic urban planning.","Montenegro, Alexandra L.","Rey-Gozalo, Guillermo","Arenas, Jorge P.","Suarez, Enrique",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,Road traffic noise,Urban sound environment,Sustainable urban planning,Multinomial ordered logistic regression,,,,,,,,JUL 1 2024,Streets classification models by urban features for road traffic noise estimation

Through this analysis, the points of incidence of AM were identified within each of these axes. The study highlights the potential of AM to act as a transformative driver in urban development, integrating an ecological framework where urban systems are interconnected and mutually reinforced. This perspective reveals walking and cycling as a catalyst for reshaping urban interactions. In light of this, future cities must adopt a human urban scale through compactness that fosters complexity and diverse and engaging urban interactions. In addition, the enjoyability achieved through AM brings significant ecosystem benefits by promoting awareness of others, nature, and the interconnectedness between the individual and the city. This represents a new paradigm shift in which the automobile does not play the central role, allowing more sustainable ways of living together.","Correa, Froylan","Bartorila, Miguel","Ribeiro-Palacios, Monica","Perez-Soto, Gerardo I.","Rodriguez-Resendiz, Juvenal",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,SMART CITIES,active mobility,ecosystemic urbanism,smart cities,technology,sustainability,walking,cycling,,,,,DEC 2024,Toward the Human Scale in Smart Cities: Exploring the Role of Active Mobility in Ecosystemic Urbanism

However, the enablers and barriers to micromobility adoption have not been fully understood and classified. Moreover, these factors have not been compared at urban and suburban levels hindering their widespread acceptance and adoption, which differ among various regions. Current study aims to address this knowledge gap by reviewing the literature published over the past decade on private and shared micromobility vehicles, such as bicycles, e-bikes, and e-scooters. The following two review methodologies are applied: a bibliometric analysis and a systematic analysis. The bibliometric analysis includes 3729 publications, provides a global overview of the micromobility literature and identifies relevant research directions through performance analysis and science mapping. The systematic analysis consists of 54 selected articles out of 1670 from the refined search algorithm. The identified enablers and barriers are classified into three levels of influence: micro (personal perception), meso (social and natural environment), and macro (general aspects of transport modes and policy). The results indicate a rise in pro-environmental attitudes and a desire for healthy and convenient transportation. Major barriers to micromobility adoption include poor regulations, safety concerns, and insufficient infrastructure in suburban areas. Furthermore, the lack of research on suburban context highlights the need for comprehensive studies on micromobility across diverse regions, which is critical for the development of tailored micromobility solutions that can improve the adoption rates across various socio-economic and geographical settings.","Bobicic, Ognjen","Esztergar-Kiss, Domokos",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,Micromobility,Adoption,Urban,Suburban,Bibliometric analysis,Systematic review,,,,,,DEC 15 2024,Enablers and barriers to micromobility adoption: Urban and suburban contexts

According to current state-of-the-art, a local energy systems perspective is yet and typically dismissed in the existing road transport decarbonization studies. Such studies tend to be limited to a national or global perspective, ignoring the challenges that rural areas may face. This study aims to develop a contextspecific method that considers a local energy perspective when generating rural road transport decarbonization pathways. Literature review findings were iterated through participatory interactions with municipal officials from three Swedish municipalities, representing different-sized rural areas. Based on the municipalities' climate actions (fossil-free municipality targets) and the availability of local resources, five pathways were identified in an iterative and co-development manner. These pathways differed with respect to: (i) local electricity production; (ii) use of bio-sources; (iii) flexibility of public transport services; and (iv) tourism-related road traffic demands. The identified pathways were subjected to a qualitative performance assessment, which revealed that the local feasibility of each identified pathway depends on economic, environmental, and logistical factors. Although all identified pathways have the potential to contribute to the decarbonization of the municipalities' road transport systems, the municipalities preferred different pathways depending on their socioeconomic, technical, and regulatory priorities.","Laurin, Maria de Oliveira","Selvakkumaran, Sujeetha","Ahlgren, Erik O.","Grahn, Maria",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE,Literature review,Local energy system,Non -urban road transport decarbonization,Pathways,Participatory approach,Semi -structured interviews,,,,,,AUG 2024,Are decarbonization strategies municipality-dependent?

Row_166,"Public transit offers urban populations physical accessibility to resources and opportunities. However, at the same time, transit trips often expose users to extreme environmental conditions, such as extreme heat and cold since transit journeys usually include out-of-vehicle trip segments including walking and waiting. Such exposure can be considered as environmental health costs because exposure to weather extremes can lead to adverse health outcomes. Even worse, climate change is increasing the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. In this context, how can we make public transit accessibility measures ready for climate change? This paper attempts to answer this question by developing a generalized cost function approach combining travel time and environmental health costs into an integrated measure of dual accessibility: a measure of the travel costs of accessing a fixed number of destinations. We synthesize transport science, environmental health, remote sensing, and urban climatology to empower the proposed framework. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed method, we carry out an example study that incorporates transit passengers' extreme cold exposure into accessibility measures in the city of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Further, we perform a social equity analysis to investigate whether the increase in total integrated costs (i.e., decrease in accessibility) due to the inclusion of environmental health costs disproportionately affects socially disadvantaged population groups. The proposed method enables a more realistic and practical measurement of public transit accessibility under climate change; thereby, improving the readiness and resilience of our society and transport systems for future challenges.","Ahmed, Naser","Lee, Jinhyung","Liu, Luyu","Kim, Junghwan","Jang, Kee Moon","Wang, Jinfei",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS,Environmental health,Public transit,Accessibility,Extreme weather exposure,Climate change,Social equity,,,,,,SEP 2024,The cost of climate change: A generalized cost function approach for incorporating extreme weather exposure into public transit accessibility
Row_167,"Often promoted by planning and transportation authorities as one of the principal ways to reduce the impact of mobility on transportation gas emissions, carpooling practices have increased over recent decades for daily commuting as well as long-distance travel. However, mainly due to the lack of data, little is known about the geography of these trips. On the one hand, the intensity of supply and demand may favor urban areas alongside common transportation systems. On the other hand, the scarcity of public transport in rural areas or small towns can support the growth of these shared mobilities.

This paper applies a systematic review to assess the role of AVs in urban areas. It reviews 41 articles published between 2003 and 2023, and uses inductive and deductive coding approaches to identify seven themes and thirty sub-themes within the literature. The seven include: benefits, attitudes, and behaviours and user perception, climate adaptation, climate mitigation, legislation and regulations, sustainability, and infrastructure. Studies related to benefits accounted for 25% of the sample, followed by behaviours and user perception (24%) and sustainability (22%). The least amount of research has been undertaken on the role of AVs to support climate adaptation.

Recent evolutions in transport planning has heightened the interest in analyzing the way mobility factors affect the perceptions of a place's quality. The gap in previous work lies in the limited focus on qualitative, human-centered perspectives regarding the impacts of public projects like the MBS on urban space quality. This study uniquely fills this void by examining the influence of the MBS on people's lives and the quality of urban spaces. Comparing pre- and post-Metrobus scenarios, along with questionnaire surveys of riders and shopkeepers, exposes the neglect of the social image during design and construction. The system was implemented with a focus solely on hard, core infrastructure, thereby neglecting soft components such as area development, social and cultural value, and human-centered design.

Row_170,"Background: Indigenous Maori conceptualisations of home extend beyond the house and encompass the ways in which people move in and around their environments. This movement is enabled by appropriate and accessible transport systems. For Maori living in social housing, who may already be disconnected from their whanau (family group, extended family), friends and places of belonging, access to the wider urban environment is essential for supporting health and wellbeing. Despite literature depicting Maori inequities in both transport access and in transportrelated health outcomes such as access to a general practitioner, there is little research that explores transport as an enabler of wellbeing for Maori living in social housing. This is the gap that this research fills. Methods: This qualitative research took a Kaupapa Maori approach and privileged Indigenous Maori worldviews and concepts throughout. Interviews were conducted with twelve Maori residents living in social housing complexes in Christchurch New Zealand. Interviews explored how Maori experienced their housing complex and the travel they did between their complex and the wider urban environment. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, coded and analysed by the lead Maori researcher. Results: Results describe how residents use different forms of transport to access the environment around their social housing complexes. Despite utilising a wide range of transport modes, participants discussed the barriers they face when using both private and public forms of transport. The research also looks at how Maori living in social housing perceive novel transport technologies and poses questions surrounding the suitability of these schemes for reducing transport inequities. Conclusions: These localised experiences provide insight into the role transport plays in creating a home and in establishing and maintaining social connections for Maori living in social housing. In doing so, the research explains the link between transport access and Indigenous wellbeing while also exploring some of the concerns those living in social housing have surrounding their inclusion in transport solutions.

This requires real-time traffic information data, re -scheduling tools, and features for quick interaction between platform users. Second, features to create trust between strangers are needed, which require trade-offs between strict identity check and quick registration. Third, carpooling pick-up/drop-off may either endanger safety (if bus stops are used) or require inconvenient prior agreements, negatively affecting the MaaS platform's dynamism.

The emergence of drones equipped with advanced visual sensors provide a comprehensive aerial perspective and versatile mobility, opening up new possibilities for efficient traffic monitoring. In this research, we demonstrate the efficient monitoring of usage levels in outdoor public parking lots using drones. We deployed a number of drones flying during the peak periods for two days over four major outdoor parking lots in Pully, Switzerland, while monitoring on-street parking in their proximity. Our proposed pipeline involves identifying parking areas through geo-referencing and an image feature matching approach, followed by vehicle detection using an innovative boosted pseudo-labeling method. Central to our pipeline is an innovative boosted pseudo-labeling technique that enhances detection accuracy by generating pseudo labels from stationary vehicles observed in multiple frames, thereby reducing the need for manual data annotations. From the video collected from our drone experiment, we automate the monitoring of the outdoor parking areas over time and days. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the occupancy rate of each parking area, encompassing both off-street and on-street parking lots, as well as dynamic interactions between different locations, and also examined the turnover rate of individual parking spots.

Our results show significant variation in the levels of access to different opportunities across Finnish municipalities. The Palma ratios reveal that the largest disparities are typically located in municipalities surrounding large city regions, where wealthier residents tend to have better access to opportunities compared to low-income populations.

This study examined how staying at home was associated with population density and whether car ownership and public transport mediated the association. Methods: Data from 86,077 older adults who participated in the Sixth Greater Tokyo Metropolitan Area Household Travel Survey were used. We conducted multilevel logistic regression analyses to estimate the odds of staying at home (not reporting any travel on a survey day) by population density. Further analyses for the samples stratified by car ownership and public transport stop (PTS) density were conducted. Results: Staying at home was more common in low population density areas. Each additional 100 persons/ha was associated with a 15% lower odds ratio of staying at home. This association was moderated by PTS density score but not by car ownership. Population density was not significantly associated with staying at home in areas with high PTS density score (odds ratio [OR] = 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.93, 1.02), but low density was associated with a higher odds ratio in areas with lower PTS density score (OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.76, 0.85) and regardless of car ownership.

Utilizing data from a 2020 survey on perceived accessibility in the Netherlands, the research finds that acceptable travel distances vary between urban and rural areas, contingent upon the mode of transportation. Rural residents accept larger distances, primarily facilitated by car use, while acceptable distances for active modes are higher in urban areas. Particularly in rural areas, travel distances do not always align with the acceptance of distances, especially regarding public transport. The key message for accessibility policy is that uniform distance thresholds may be ineffective across regions with diverse accessibility needs.

Row_179,"The transportation dynamics within a European city, V ienna, are examined using a multi-graph representation of the city's network. The focus is on time-optimized routing algorithms and the effects of altering the average waiting penalty at traffic lights. The impact of these modifications, whether an increase to 60, 90, or even 150 seconds or a decrease to 10 seconds, is observed in the selection of transportation modes and routes for identical origin and destination pairs. The investigation also extends to whether routes shift towards secondary street networks to avoid traffic lights as the waiting penalty increases. Experimental variations in average waiting time for cars aim to uncover detailed effects on transportation mode choices, route length and time changes, and variations in human energy expenditure. These findings could provide valuable insights into the transportation network and its possibilities and help in urban planning and policy development. The results indicate a shift in transportation mode as the waiting penalty for cars at traffic lights increases, and in some instances, routes are redirected to roads of lower importance such as residential or service roads.","Gogousou, Ioanna","Canestrini, Manuela","Alinaghi, Negar","Michail, Dimitrios","Giannopoulos, Ioannis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,27TH AGILE CONFERENCE ON GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SCIENCE GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SCIENCE FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE,,Traffic Lights,Urban Mobility,Transportation Networks,Public Transport,OpenStreetMap,,,,,,,2024,The Impact of Traffic Lights on Modal Split and Route Choice: A use-case in V ienna
Row_180,"Concerned by the increasing environmental impact of urban areas and the mobility sector, the study examines mobility in Reykjavik, Iceland. Reykjavik residents have been found to have high emissions in both local and leisure travel. The study aims to explore the connections between urban mobility and leisure travel behaviour using a novel method - activity spaces. The relationship between activity spaces and travel emissions is examined for the first time, based on data of about 700 respondents from a softGIS survey. Connections between activity spaces, local and domestic travel were found. High levels of urban mobility were connected to higher engagement in domestic leisure travel, indicating the presence of a highly mobile lifestyle among Reykjavik urbanites. The reasons for the travel could stem from compensation behaviour, or social network dispersion. In addition, the study points at a lack of functioning 15-minute neighbourhoods and public transit in the capital area. Some differences between income groups were noticed, particularly in urban mobility, pointing at the need to examine the social floor of mobility even within generally affluent societies, so that disadvantaged groups do not get left behind in the sustainable mobility transition. As it has been suggested that people travel for their well-being and to escape the tumult of urban life, the relationship between urban mobility, especially environmental exposure during daily travel, and well-being should be studied. Therefore, the study urges for sustainable mobility transitions and urban planning policies that consider the needs and well-being of citizens in all socio-demographic groups.","Raudsepp, Johanna","Thorbjornsson, Kayla M.","Hasanzadeh, Kamyar","Czepkiewicz, Michal","Arnadottir, Arora","Heinonen, Jukka",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,TRAVEL BEHAVIOUR AND SOCIETY,Travel emissions,Activity space,GHG emissions,Urban planning,Mobility,,,,,,,JAN 2025,"Activity spaces and leisure travel emissions: A case study in Reykjavik, Iceland"

At the same time, there has been a shift in urban dynamics, characterised by the diversification of peripheries and the emergence of sub-centralities, challenging conventional notions of urban marginalisation. It underscores the need for a deeper understanding of urban insertion as the attention moves from macro -scale segregation to micro -scale analysis. Amidst this context, urban insertion remains a subject of dispute and ambiguity within the literature, often conflated with peripheralisation and segregation. Addressing this gap, we advance toward a concept of urban insertion, proposing an analytical framework that integrates multiple criteria from diverse disciplinary perspectives. This framework was empirically validated in the metropolitan area of Curitiba (Brazil) by analysing 55 social housing developments constructed over the past decade.

Researchers are increasingly interested in understanding this digital service's potential acceptance and uptake. Despite this interest, the extant literature lacks a comprehensive overview of various factors that play a role in its acceptance by target users. In this study, we aim to establish a current state of the art of MaaS user acceptance to inform practice in the effective design of related services, and to support the scientific community by offering future directions for their research. To achieve this, we performed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of relevant empirical studies and analyzed the factors considered significant in MaaS acceptance by target users. Our in-depth analyses of these works resulted in several factors, which we grouped into three categories: traveler and trip characteristics, service and technology characteristics, and urban environment characteristics. Certain factors, such as age, trip frequency, MaaS bundle price, and transportation facility, were found to be consistent in their influence on MaaS acceptance. However, empirical works conflict regarding the influence of a number of factors, such as income and public transport card ownership. This study serves as a comprehensive source of the factors investigated in the literature to the moment and a basis for future research to improve our understanding of factors that require further investigation.","El Mustapha, Houda","Ozkan, Baris","Turetken, Oktay",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,COMMUNICATIONS IN TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH,Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS),User acceptance,Systematic literature review (SLR),Adoption,Influential factors,,,,,,,DEC 2024,Acceptance of Mobility-as-a-Service: Insights from empirical studies on influential factors

Using MATSim, we simulate a use case where SAEVs are introduced in multiple suburban zones at the outskirts of Vienna (Austria), which are characterized by relatively low population density, but have access to at least one rail -based public transport stop. For all combinations of different fleet sizes and fare levels, we find that a relatively small share of car trips by residents of these zones (7%-14%) are replaced by SAEVs, generating CO2 emissions reductions of 5%-11%. Moreover, 23%-35% of trips previously undertaken by foot or bicycle are replaced by SAEVs, as well as 10%-20% of public transport trips. The potential of SAEVs to reduce the use and ownership of private vehicles in suburban areas therefore seems to be rather limited, which is also reflected in our finding that one SAEV usually replaces only 2-4 private vehicles. The potential becomes somewhat larger when the usage and ownership of private cars is assumed to become more expensive, leading to 17%-20% of car trips being replaced by SAEVs and generating CO2 emissions reductions of up to 32%.","Peer, Stefanie","Mueller, Johannes","Naqvi, Asjad","Straub, Markus",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,TRANSPORT POLICY,MATSim,Traffic simulation,Shared autonomous electric vehicles,Demand-responsive transport (DRT),First-mile/last-mile,Micro-transit,Sub-urban,,,,,MAR 2024,"Introducing shared, electric, autonomous vehicles (SAEVs) in sub-urban zones: Simulating the case of Vienna"
Row_185,"The dramatic experience due to COVID-19 spread has reshaped travel preferences of public transport (PT) users worldwide, especially in urban areas. As the PT is expected to recover its major role in such areas, it is important to understand the factors influencing PT users' willingness to pay (WTP) for onboard safety measures, in the event of future pandemic scenarios. Furthermore, both individual latent traits (e.g. concern for the pandemic, trust/distrust in city services and national government actions) and perceived entity of the pandemic are expected to influence preferences for PT users under such a post-pandemic scenario. This paper analyses the preferences and attitudes of PT users in the Naples metropolitan area (Italy) through a hybrid choice model (HCM). First, WTPs for onboard service features are assessed in three hypothetical pandemic alert scenarios, which are explicitly introduced in the model as context variables. Second, the model allows for assessing the relative importance of onboard characteristics as the pandemic scenario evolves. Third, the model incorporates psycho-attitudinal variables and shows how they impact WTPs. Finally, several policy implications for policymakers and transport companies operating in the study area are derived. In particular: (a) WTPs for increased/reduced occupancy rate and green pass check at the entrance significantly depend upon the latent traits investigated; (b) relative importance of safety measures varies significantly between the pandemic alert scenarios; (c) possible ticketing strategies for PT users have been investigated based on the HCM findings, searching for the configuration of safety measures to ensure that users accept a 100% allowed capacity on board during moderate/high pandemic scenarios without varying the price, as well as the price variations needed to stay in an indifference range of the utility in restricted conditions of the service; (d) the acceptability of safety measures has been assessed through a simulation exercise, finding that non-vaccinated travellers are 2.6 and 2.1 times more willing to accept a full capacity of the buses/trains on board than vaccinated people if subscribers or not, respectively.","Tinessa, Fiore","Garcia, Concepcion Roman","Simonelli, Fulvio","Papola, Andrea","Pagliara, Francesca",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,Discrete choice,Error component logit,Hybrid choice model,COVID-19,Public transport,Post-pandemic,Post-vaccination,optimal ticket,,,,DEC 2024,How public transport users would react to different pandemic alert scenarios in the post-vaccine era?

Implementing these measures, such as transport infrastructure projects, requires public acceptance. However, there is a lack of research on how sustainable urban mobility transitions impact commuters' emotional experiences. This study aims to understand the formation of emotional commuting experiences and to analyse the impact of the introduction of a tramway on those experiences. The findings are mainly based on qualitative data (33 interviews) but also on quantitative data on the participants' commuting behaviour collected in a Finnish city, Tampere, which launched a new tramline a couple of months prior to data collection. The research shows a variety of triggers for negative and positive emotional commuting experiences and highlights the role of critical incidents in the formation of emotional experiences. It reveals how launching a tram in a city impacts emotional commuting experiences on many levels, even for those who do not change their main mode of commuting. It also shows the dynamics involved in emotional commuting experiences, demonstrating how emotional experiences in the construction phase may differ greatly from those after the new commuting mode has been launched. Based on the findings, we suggest that in order to guarantee public support for sustainable urban transport projects, practitioners should recognise the wide range of emotional experiences associated with commuting, even for those who do not adopt the new mode of transport, and take these experiences into account not only during the lengthy infrastructure-building phase but also during the utilisation phase.","Sandberg, Birgitta","Hurmerinta, Leila","Helminen, Ville","Leino, Henna M.","Vasankari, Tommi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART F-TRAFFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR,Commuting,Experience,Emotion,Tram,Sustainable mobility,,,,,,,JUL 2024,A new tramway and the formation of emotional commuting experiences

The methodology is based on Multi -Criteria Evaluation (MCE) in Geographic Information System (GIS) to identify the suitability of urban rail stations for integration with BSS. Seven key factors were considered: sex, age, travel purposes, public security, land use, terrain slope, and qualification of the road network for cycling.

To benefit from a new mobility system, women who have specific mobility considerations necessitate inclusion in designing automated vehicles. This study explores women's perspectives and the potential impact of automated vehicles through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. Results demonstrate concerns among women about safety in current mobility systems, vulnerabilities regarding personal safety, and stereotypes about female drivers. Additionally, mothers face additional challenges managing items for children and their demands during travel, and senior women consider safety issues and declining capabilities when contemplating driving cessation. Current experience with mobility is reflected in concerns and visions regarding automated vehicles. The absence of a driver is expressed as improved safety in driverless taxis, while it is perceived as a safety concern in automated public transportation. Mothers with children anticipate convenience in travel, whereas senior women expect enhanced mobility and social participation. These findings underscore the importance of safety in women's mobility experiences and provide insights into addressing safety and interaction issues in the design of automated vehicles. Researchers, transportation authorities, and vehicle manufacturers can leverage these results to understand women's needs better and consider them in future designs and policy developments for automated vehicles.

Row_190,"Introduction: Cities need to take action to adapt to the needs of older people and facilitate their independence, health, and well-being. Active mobility brings economic, social, environmental and health benefits. Cycling tends to decline with age, despite its potential to minimize dependency, social isolation, mobility problems, and sedentary lifestyles. There is a lack of comprehensive understanding of the factors associated with cycling among older people, which limits efforts to develop cycling initiatives for this population. Therefore, this study aims to assess the variables that influence cycling behaviour of adults and older adults. Methods: Taking Munich as a case study, we explored factors associated with the use and frequency of cycling using statistical tests and regression. Factors included neighbourhood's built environment characteristics (5D's), personal or individual level sociodemographic characteristics, and availability and usage of different transport modes from a national mobility survey (Mobilita center dot t in Deutschland, 2017, n = 11.430). Results: Statistical differences were found between older and younger adults in the use and frequency of cycling. The neighbourhood's built environment had a greater influence on the cycling behaviour of older adults than younger adults. The results revealed that older people living in peripheral neighbourhoods were more likely to use the bicycle as a means of transport. Currently, these neighbourhoods have a higher percentage of green areas, lower intersection density and lower motorized traffic. In both age groups, higher income and education levels exhibited higher odds of cycling. Additionally, older adults who are occasional car and public transport users were more likely to cycle. Conclusions: Cities should ensure cycling opportunities for individuals of all ages, irrespective of their education level or economic status. To encourage cycling in older people, urban planning efforts should prioritize the creation of safe cycling infrastructure and the development of green spaces.","Larriva, Maria Teresa Baquero","Buettner, Benjamin","Duran-Rodas, David",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT & HEALTH,Cycling,Active ageing,Healthy ageing,Built environment,Older adults,Active mobility,,,,,,MAR 2024,Active and healthy ageing: Factors associated with bicycle use and frequency among older adults- A case study in Munich

Both European and Italian regulations are pushing toward abandoning diesel fuel and the consolidation of alternative traction power sources, such as battery -electric vehicles, fuel -cell electric vehicles, and hydrogen -electric vehicles. The literature has provided some approaches toward assessing this selection such as multicriteria-decision-methods in some countries in the world. However, not enough specific attention has been paid to cost criteria, experts involved, and the type of service required.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, local authorities implemented Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTN) to encourage active travel and improve urban residential environments. This research explored people's expectations and lived experience of two LTNs in Birmingham, a large city, providing insights for future schemes. Birmingham City Council held pre-LTN (July-November 2020) and post-LTN consultations (February-April 2021). A qualitative thematic analysis of respondents' responses explored thoughts on local transport issues, expectations, and lived experiences of LTNs. There were 3751 and 791 responses to pre- and post-LTN consultations. Most respondents were female local residents; with 45-54 years olds the most frequent responders. Overarching categories: (i) Pre-LTN transport concerns and proposed solutions; (ii) Anticipated and reported benefits from the LTN and (ii) Anticipated and reported disadvantages from the LTN. Cited benefits included reduced traffic and safety concerns, increased active transport and an improved sense of community. Disadvantages included frustration, inconvenience and great resentment between residents of roads with and without filters. Both support and opposition to LTNs was found. LTNs addressed some, but not all local traffic concerns. Feelings of discrimination were noted by residents of streets without filters; high street residents encountering displaced traffic and disabled car users. Piecemeal LTN implementation may undermine community cohesion. Networks of modal filters across neighbouring residential areas with measures addressing the interplay between residential, business, school and faith environments and additional measures supporting boundary roads may maximise LTN benefits.","Pritchett, Ruth","Bartington, Suzanne","Thomas, G.

In the European context of the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan approach and Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEAs), this paper scrutinises three French localities to determine the current best practices and limitations for designing mobility plans and integrating environmental issues. Several limitations are identified: (1) limited expertise in defining and characterising actions and objectives, which complexifies plans' design, understanding, and monitoring; (2) a lack of a framework to conduct long-term quantitative environmental assessments and to use the results to influence decision effectively; and (3) monitoring processes are barely described in the documents, and the planning horizon where objectives are defined is not in sync with the indicators' mandatory evaluation period. This French case study thus reveals that European planning practices must be further analysed and improved to deal with the rising environmental concerns, e.g. through an operational framework to design mobility plans with effective integration of environmental issues.","Baltazar, Julien","Bouillass, Ghada","Vallet, Flore","Puchinger, Jakob","Perry, Nicolas",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transportation planning,SUMP,Local authorities,French cities,Strategic decision -making,,,,,,,SEP 2024,Integrating environmental issues into the design of mobility plans: Insights from French practices
Row_194,"Exposure of the population living in urban areas to an increasing level of air pollution has led local authorities to implement vehicle access restrictions to limit the circulation of pollutant vehicles and foster sustainable travel habits. With these aims, Low Emission Zones (LEZs) have been introduced in several European cities. Many previous works have evaluated the impacts of such regulation; however, they adopted pre-defined assumptions about new travels to access the regulated area and neglected potential behavioral changes induced by the measure. The aim of this paper is to quantify the effects of a LEZ on vehicle pollutant emissions, considering potential short-term variations of travel habits after its introduction (i.e., vehicle replacement, modal shift and destination change), and the associated uncertainty. The study area was the Municipality of Padova (Italy), where a LEZ is likely to be enforced. A holistic evaluation framework was applied combining a behavioral model and a traffic simulation model, calibrated using responses from a mobility survey administered to local stakeholders and traffic counts. The results highlighted the measure could contribute to induce fleet renewal and modal shift toward sustainable transportation means, that could be furtherly fostered by increasing the awareness of the benefits of the LEZ. Furthermore, the outcomes confirmed that the intervention could significantly reduce vehicle pollutant emissions within the area. Nevertheless, a spillover effect could occur outside the LEZ, due to the long detours that travelers deciding to avoid entering the zone have to perform.","Ceccato, Riccardo","Rossi, Riccardo","Gastaldi, Massimiliano",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,Urban Vehicle Access Regulation,Integrated Choice and Latent Variable model,Sustainable mobility,Pollutant emissions,Modal shift,Fleet renewal,,,,,,JUL 2024,Low emission zone and mobility behavior: Ex-ante evaluation of vehicle pollutant emissions

We explore the preferences of SPT in a commuting context, incorporating individual preference heterogeneity in a discrete choice model. We systematically identify the relationship between choice behaviors and individual heterogeneity in alternative attributes and psychological factors stemming from socio-demographic characteristics. The integrated choice and latent variable (ICLV) model with a mixed logit form is adopted, and the key findings can be summarized as follows: Preference heterogeneity is observed in the travel cost variable, which can be explained by characteristics such as the presence of a preschooler, household size, and income. CO2 emissions do not have a statistically significant impact on choices. Furthermore, psychological factors are also explained through socio-demographic characteristics, and it is found that low-carbon knowledge positively influences low-carbon habits. Psychological factors significantly affect choices. Respondents who dislike transfers and prioritize punctuality are less likely to choose SPT, while those who have positive low-carbon attitudes are more likely to do so. Finally, scenario analysis is conducted to forecast mode share based on improvements in SPT alternative attributes and variations in attribute levels. Policy implications are then provided to enhance the acceptability of SPT.","Lee, Gyeongjae","Kim, Sujae","Koo, Jahun","Choo, Sangho",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,SUSTAINABILITY,sustainable public transit,commuting mode choice,integrated choice and latent variable model,mixed logit,low-carbon attitude,,,,,,,SEP 2024,Exploring Psychological Factors Influencing the Adoption of Sustainable Public Transit Considering Preference Heterogeneity
Row_196,"Micromobility and public transport integration is an area of urban mobility that has been increasingly gaining attention and importance. The necessity to provide improvements to public transport services and their spatial reach in order to reduce the number and volume of car trips in cities is irrefutable. The integration of micro- mobility and public transport is often presented as a valuable strategy to improve door-to-door connectivity and coverage of existing public transport services, via provision of key first- and last-mile or access-egress connections. The aim of this study was to understand and model the propensity of commuters in County Dublin to use micromobility (private and shared) in the first- and last-miles of their public transport journeys. A stated preference experiment was conducted with a focus on these specific segments of the journey and a mixed logit model was estimated to identify user characteristics and preferences based on socio-economic factors, mobility patterns and attitudes towards and previous experience of shared mobility. The results show that, in this particular case study, respondents with a strong walking preference were less likely to be interested in private micromobility and sharing services for the first- and last-mile. A common assumption that walking is a last resort, and only chosen when there are no other options available was not confirmed by the findings of this study. Moreover, competition between the modes showed that private bicycles are the preferred mode after walking, followed by private escooters, while shared modes were less likely to be chosen over walking, and shared e-scooters less so than shared bicycles. Overall, the findings suggest that a small percentage of the sample - mainly young (<35 years old) and male respondents with interest in and experience of e-scooters - were interested in using private and shared escooters for the first- and last-mile, but that the majority of the respondents were likely to choose walking, albeit with longer travel times overall.","Oeschger, Giulia","Caulfield, Brian","Carroll, Paraic",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,TRAVEL BEHAVIOUR AND SOCIETY,Micromobility,Shared mobility,E -Scooters,Multimodality,First,and last-mile,,,,,,JAN 2025,"User characteristics and preferences for micromobility use in first- and last-mile journeys in Dublin, Ireland"

Although carsharing has been used for over a decade, several aspects need further investigation, such as the impact of user's psychological factors on service use, as well as the factors impacting users' choices between different carsharing operators, in particular their preferences for different payment schemes, and their perceptions of the operators' application rating. Accordingly, four hybrid choice models (HCM) were estimated to investigate factors impacting (i) the knowledge about carsharing services, (ii) carsharing adoption, (iii) the shift from other modes to carsharing, (iv) the choice between carsharing operators with different payment schemes, using a large survey sample (N = 1044 responses 9469 SP observation) from Munich, Germany. The models showed the significance of sociodemographics, such as income level, education level, household size, employment status, ownership of a bike, access to a car, the availability of a driving license, and public transport subscription-based tickets on the carsharing use directly and indirectly, and four psychological factors encompassing different personality traits (i.e., adventurous), travel behavior, and attitudes were found to be significant in the various models; the latter covered service-related attitudes (perceived carsharing app importance) and travel behavior attitudes or profiles (frequent public transport user and frequent shared micromobility user).

Row_198,"Shared E-scooters were introduced as a sustainable mode of transport that could help reduce motorized traffic externalities; however, problems, such as inequitable use, emerged shortly after the start of their operations. While existing literature has focused primarily on user and vehicle characteristics as the main drivers of E-scooter inequitable use, it fails to understand or capture other factors that impact travel decisions, such as urban design and activity accessibility. This study proposes a framework to evaluate shared (E-)scooters' equity based on accessibility or lack of accessibility to different activities compared to other existing modes of transportation. To test the proposed framework, a sensitivity analysis tested various scenarios using data from scooter trips in Louisville, Kentucky. In total, 1903 main scenarios and 7612 sub-scenarios were evaluated, focusing on accessibility gains for different social groups, modes of transport that could be replaced by scooters, and different locations within the study area. As a result, scooters have the potential to improve current levels of accessibility in 8% of the examined scenarios, mostly when replacing uni-modal walking, biking, and public transportation trips. Furthermore, disadvantaged groups did not gain significant accessibility advantages compared to the rest of the population. We argue that the observed inequitable use of scooters is inherited from the urban structure and activity density. In areas with fewer activities, where mostly disadvantaged social groups live, people use E-scooters less. In order to make E-scooters a competitive mode of transport in disadvantaged areas, urban structural solutions such as densification of land use and promotion of different activities should be considered first.","Abouelela, Mohamed","Duran-Rodas, David","Antoniou, Constantinos",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,Shared mobility,Shared-E-scooter,Accessibility,Transportation justice,Open source data,,,,,,,MAR 2024,Do we all need shared E-scooters?

Understanding the segmentation of public support for charge is crucial for informed policymaking. This study conducted a questionnaire survey among a Singaporean population, collecting data from 1953 respondents on their demographic profiles as well as their behaviour, attitudes, and willingness to pay for disposable plastic bags. The survey data suggest a supportive environment in Singapore for introducing charges on disposable plastic bags with most respondents preferred a charge of SGD 0.10 or below. By employing Cramer's V test and latent class analysis, we have affirmed the existence of differential policy support and willingness-to-pay, identifying five distinct classes of respondents: Non-supporters, Ideal supporters, Costsensitive supporters, Moderate Pricing Supporters, and High Pricing Supporters, with some classes showing distinct profiles in terms of age, education level, and monthly income. Further analysis of the effects of imposed charges revealed that a charge that is too low appears to have a limited impact on reducing the overall usage of disposable plastic bags, whereas a charge that is too high is likely to yield diminishing returns and could potentially lead to an increase in public complaints. These results could provide crucial policy implications for addressing plastic issues and highlight that charging for disposable plastic bags is not just an end goal but a means to promote reduced consumption.","Bai, Qiaowen","Ong, Ghim Ping","Seet, Jing Shuan Sarah","Wang, Xinru",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,Latent class analysis,Plastic bag charge,Policy implications,Public support,Singapore,Willingness to pay,,,,,,OCT 20 2024,Differential public support for disposable plastic bag charge in Singapore: Insights from latent class segmentation

Our analysis indicates the role of public participation in the process, which affected and strengthened the transformations. This approach is greatly enhanced by the application of the social-ecological urbanism framework, with its analysis of services performed by various system components.

Row_201,"Nudging is a popular approach to changing behavior by designing interventions to encourage, for instance, sustainable or healthy actions without necessarily limiting freedom of choice. Nudging could show particular potential in changing travel behavior by providing governments with softer policy options to reduce the negative impacts of private vehicles in urban areas. This study examines the efficacy of nudging in changing interest in using public transport, active modes, and carsharing in Flanders, Belgium (n = 292), focusing on moral nudges, highlighting individual and social benefits, and norm nudges, using social pressure to promote appropriate behavior, through independent and paired sample t -tests, ANOVA mean -comparison tests, and multiple linear regression models. Results indicate that moral nudging is effective overall, but particularly for improving interest in carsharing, potentially providing an option for individuals wanting to make environmentally and socially conscious choices without drastically changing their lifestyles. Norm nudging was effective for public transport and especially active travel, indicating that mobility cultures and social acceptance are important to these modes. Attitudes toward public transport and carsharing were important to nudge susceptibility. Women might have greater concerns about making environmentally moral choices, resulting in higher moral nudge susceptibility, particularly for active travel, and trips taken with companions might be more easily swayed toward active modes. Those with greater time flexibility who are younger might be a target group for carsharing, especially when influenced by moral arguments, while older retired and full-time employed individuals may not be willing to give up their private cars and carsharing may not be practical for families with children. Nudging might be effective in changing travel behavior in conjunction with other policy measures to promote sustainable and healthy transport, ideally through a nudge unit to test, advise, and implement these subtle nudges. Further, the location, quality of transport services, and geographical density of cities are crucial aspects regarding the effectiveness of nudges in real -life scenarios.","Steffen, Juliet","Hook, Hannah","Witlox, Frank",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART F-TRAFFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR,Nudge theory,Behavioral policy,Travel behavior change,Travel psychology,Sustainable travel,Flanders (Belgium),,,,,,MAY 2024,"Improving interest in public, active, and shared travel modes through nudging interventions"
Row_202,"Commute trips typically constitute a major share of weekday trips made in urban areas. Hence, commute distances and modes of travel usage are closely linked with the level of transport sustainability of a city. The COVID19 pandemic has resulted in a significant change in commute patterns - the length and frequency of commute trips and the usage rate of public transport in particular. To ensure the long-term sustainability of transport in a world faced with the persistent threat of potential pandemics, it is crucial to understand these changes. This paper empirically examines how the residential locations and commute patterns of a segment of subway commuters in Beijing changed during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Passively generated smart card data from 8,792,539 subway users were used to quantify the relative impact of different factors contributing to these changes. The results indicate a notable trend of residential relocation towards the city centre that is opposite to the trend of moving away from city centres observed in some other countries. Further, it is observed that the pandemic has acted as a catalyst for individuals with long commute times (over 45 min) to reconsider their locations, aiming to reduce commuting time. Consequently, such relocations lead to an average commute time reduction. The findings contribute to advancing existing knowledge related to the long-term mobility and sustainability implications of the pandemic, some of which are expected to be transferable to future pandemic contexts.","Wang, Yu","Choudhury, Charisma","Hancock, Thomas O.","Wang, Yacan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,TRAVEL BEHAVIOUR AND SOCIETY,Residential location,Public transport commute patterns,Subway smart card data,Pandemic,,,,,,,,APR 2025,Investigating the changes in residential location and commute patterns during the pandemic using smart card data

This may encourage individuals to shift from private vehicles to public transit, easing the burden on traffic and its negative impacts. Hence, to know how OD demand is going to vary in future, a state-of-the-art OD demand prediction model needs to be developed. Previously, studies have developed zone -based prediction models which may not be appropriate for predicting OD demand within a route of public transit. Additionally, spatial correlations between the stops of public transit must be included in the model for improved forecasting accuracy. Hence, in an effort to fulfil these gaps, a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) is developed to forecast the OD demand of public bus transit with nodes being the bus stops and links between them representing the passenger flow between the stops. Land use around the bus stops is retrieved as a node feature and included in the model to account for the spatial correlation between the stops. The model is trained using a real -life dataset from the public bus service of Davangere city located in India. Land use around the bus stops is extracted from the Davangere city master plan, procured from the urban development authority. The developed model is compared with conventional models and the findings show that the GCN model performs better in terms of prediction accuracy than the baseline models. Additionally, at the stop level, the performance of the model remained stable due to the inclusion of land use data compared to conventional models where land use data was not considered.","Shanthappa, Nithin K.","Mulangi, Raviraj H.","Manjunath, Harsha M.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,CASE STUDIES ON TRANSPORT POLICY,Origin-Destination demand prediction,graph convolutional neural network (GCN),Public bus transit,Land use,Electronic Ticketing Machine (ETM),,,,,,,SEP 2024,Origin-destination demand prediction of public transit using graph convolutional neural network

Based on a Q methodological analysis, we reveal four distinct perspectives, which reflect a broad spectrum of ""generally pro"" and ""generally against"" positions: (i) More roads, more traffic, (ii) Less politics, more facts, (iii) Better roads, better city, and (iv) The highway must be built.

Row_205,"Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) has been widely recognised as an affordable and effective mass transport system that can solve various mobility issues in countries that are unable to afford rail-based mass transit options. However, it is extremely challenging to predict the demand for the first BRT service in a city of a developing country with a weak public transport system using aggregate models, given the radical difference in the level of service between the BRT and the existing modes. Further, there can be substantial changes in the activity and travel patterns in a city after the introduction of the BRT which simpler disaggregate level analysis tools are unable to predict. Agentbased simulation tools, which are the state-of-the-art tools for simulating complex travel behaviour, are hence more appropriate for predicting the network conditions after the introduction of a new BRT system. But the application of such simulation tools has been primarily limited to developed countries where the transport landscape and the travel behaviour are very different from the developing countries. To address this gap, this paper presents a demand forecasting model for BRT and integrates it into an activity-based micro-simulation tool in the context of Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh and one of the fastest growing megacities in the world. The model was developed based on an existing multi-agent, activity-based, travel demand simulator (MATSim). The MATSim implementation in the context of Dhaka focused on two aspects: (1) implementing behaviour models in MATSim to reflect the mode choice in the presence of the proposed BRT (2) integrating multiple data sources (including stated-preference data) for calibrating the mode choice and other components of MATSim to realistically mimic the travel behaviour in the city. Once calibrated, different access scenarios for BRT were simulated using MATSim, and the sensitivity of the outputs to different modelling assumptions is tested. Results from the simulation showed that the marginal utility of travel time, travel cost, and pricing structure of BRT significantly influenced BRT travel demands. Also, BRT demand was found to be the highest (25% of the total trips) in the scenario with multi-modal access/egress connections. While such direct model outputs presented in this paper will be useful for the planners to maximise the ridership of the proposed BRT, the calibrated simulator will be also useful for the evaluation of other innovative transport modes in the context of Dhaka in the future.","Zannat, Khatun E.","Laudan, Janek","Choudhury, Charisma F.","Hess, Stephane",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Bus rapid transit,Agent -based model,MATSim,Public transport,Dhaka,Bangladesh,South Asia,,,,,MAR 2024,"Developing an agent-based microsimulation for predicting the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) demand in developing countries: A case study of Dhaka, Bangladesh"

In this study, we developed a database of 50 MaaS projects in Japan, primarily covering regional and rural areas, to summarize their business stages and attributes including service type, evaluation indicators, objectives, and stakeholders. Subsequently, we analyzed the factors associated with project continuity using descriptive statistics, cross-tabulation, and ordered logit modeling. The results showed that projects that used user satisfaction as an evaluation indicator and improvements in public transportation service qualities as an objective were more likely to continue than those that did not. The evaluation that focused on changes in the number of passengers exhibited a negative relationship with continuity. Moreover, continuity was positively associated with projects incorporating AI-driven demand-responsive transport and/or multimodal services as well as those in target areas with formulated local public transportation plans. These results indicate that the projects had difficulty achieving the target change in the number of passengers and that the satisfaction evaluation might have yielded higher scores; additionally, the projects that focused on key concepts of MaaS continued.

Row_207,"Measuring traffic performance is critical for public agencies which manage traffic and individuals who. This is the topic which the authors attempt to emphasize. One potential challenge for traffic prediction tasks is that short-term-incident-induced traffic pattern changes cannot be timely detected and the deployed model cannot adapt to the new traffic pattern. As for encountering long-term incidents, such as during COVID-19, traffic patterns are gradually changing, and the prediction model also needs to be periodically updated to avoid the so-called out-of-distribution problem. Therefore, the online training and predicting mechanisms can facilitate model updates, deployment of traffic prediction applications, and the planning of trips, especially when special events happen, such as the long-lasting COVID-19 pandemic. However, most existing traffic performance metrics narrowly focus on one aspect of the impacts but not comprehensive changes to the network. Further, during the pandemic, urban traffic patterns and travelers' trip planning were dramatically affected and, thus, network-wide online traffic prediction became an urgent but more complicated task. To overcome such challenges, this study proposes a traffic performance score (TPS) incorporating multiple parameters for measuring both urban and freeway network-wide traffic performance. The TPS is compared with other metrics to show its superiority. To solve the challenging network-wide online traffic prediction task, this study also proposes an online training and updating strategy to predict network-wide traffic performance. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model with the online learning strategy outperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy and learning efficiency. In addition, the TPS measurement and its related online prediction functions are implemented on a publicly accessible platform and applied in real practice, which is another contribution of this work.","Cui, Zhiyong","Tsai, Meng-Ju","Zhu, Meixin","Yang, Hao","Liu, Chenxi","Yin, Shuyi","Wang, Yinhai",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD,data and data science,artificial intelligence and advanced computing applications,artificial intelligence,machine learning (artificial intelligence),information systems and technology,big data analytics,,,,,,AUG 2024,"Traffic Performance Score: Measuring Urban Mobility and Online Predicting of Near-Term Traffic, like Weather Forecasting"
Row_208,"Integrating emerging shared mobility with traditional fixed -line public transport is a promising solution to the mismatch between supply and demand in urban transportation systems. The advent of modular vehicles (MVs) provides opportunities for more flexible and seamless intermodal transit. The MVs, which have been implemented, are comprised of automated modular units (MUs), and can dynamically change the number of MUs comprising them at different times and stops. However, this innovative intermodal urban transit brings with it a new level of dynamism and uncertainty. In this paper, we study the problem of jointly optimizing the timetable and the vehicle schedule within an intermodal urban transit network utilizing MVs within the context of distributionally robust optimization (DRO), which allows MVs to dynamically (de)couple at each stop and permits flexible circulations of MUs across different transportation modes. We propose a DRO formulation to explore the trade-off between operators and passengers, with the objective of minimizing the worst -case expectation of the weighted sum of passengers' and operating costs. Furthermore, to address the computational intractability of the proposed DRO model, we design a discrepancy -based ambiguity set to reformulate it into a mixed -integer linear programming model. In order to obtain high -quality solutionss of realistic instances, we develop a customized decomposition -based algorithm. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The computational results of real -world case studies based on the operational data of Beijing Bus Line illustrate that the proposed integrated timetabling and vehicle scheduling method reduces the expected value of passengers' and operating costs by about 6% in comparison with the practical timetable and fixed -capacity vehicles typically used in the Beijing bus system.","Xia, Dongyang","Ma, Jihui","Azadeh, Sh.

The application of a Structural Equation Model allows to uncover a series of explanatory (attitudinal and personality) factors relevant for MaaS acceptance. Then, a cluster analysis determines four profiles of travellers in relation to their intention to embrace this new solution: 'Short-duration commuters', 'Active travellers', 'Traditional car-supporters', and 'MaaS admirers'. Overall, we identify three main barriers for the potential adoption of MaaS: low willingness to combine different modes of transport, low affinity with technology, and low reliability on the new mobility services. We also recognise that low environmental concerns seem to frustrate individuals' innovativeness.","Lopez-Carreiro, Iria","Monzon, Andres","Lopez, Elena",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,EUROPEAN TRANSPORT RESEARCH REVIEW,Mobility-as-a-Service,Behavioural model,Technology acceptance,Behavioural change,Attitudinal change,,,,,,,JAN 2 2024,Assessing the intention to uptake MaaS: the case of Randstad
Row_210,"Public transit service provision is fraught with contradictions and tensions, which today tend to converge around the city-regional scale of planning and governance. The promise of public transit is to promote economic development and improve regional accessibility, mobility, equity, and sustainability. However, these priorities can often conflict with each other, resulting in the splintering of the corresponding city-regional planning and governance structures set up to finance and deliver major transit infrastructure projects. Drawing upon a case study of transit-led city-regionalism in Denver, Colorado, USA, this article explores how the tensions and contradictions embedded within regional public transit service planning are exposed and exacerbated during times of financial austerity, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic. It examines how the neoliberal goals of promoting transit-oriented redevelopment in Denver alongside expanding service to Denver's wealthier suburbs clash with the pandemic-induced expediency of targeting transit service for front-line workers and transit-dependent populations in core urban neighborhoods. The article demonstrates that in times of COVID-19-induced urban austerity the entrepreneurial city-regional approach to infrastructure provision originally developed for the FasTracks expansion program is increasingly at odds with regional objectives to use mass transit to foster equity and transport justice.","Chestnut, Joe","Goetz, Andrew R.","Jonas, Andrew E.

Concurrently, innovative mobility solutions, such as the integration of on-demand mobility services like Demand Response Transit (DRT) and Transportation Network Companies (TNC) with Fixed Route Transit (FRT) systems, are gaining prominence. On-demand mobility, with its adaptive dynamic routing, can improve public transit access by best utilizing the existing infrastructure. However, to ensure the adequacy of the service of an integrated system, it is essential to evaluate equity and accessibility of the system. While research has explored the adaptability of integrated multi-modal transport systems, a critical gap remains in understanding the impact on transportation accessibility, particularly for transit-reliant communities. This study utilizes spatial indicators to depict accessibility changes at FRT bus stops post-integration with on-demand services. To assess the enhancement in accessibility resulting from integration, the study employed an agentbased model, testing two scenarios: i) Walking with FRT and ii) On-demand Feeder with FRT (DRT and TNC integrated as feeders). The evaluation employs key metrics, including Transit Coverage Gap, the Lorenz curve, and the Gini index, to analyze the accessibility and equity of the integrated services. Additionally, a novel measure, termed the ""Accessibility-Radius,"" is proposed to quantify spatial accessibility to FRT services. AccessibilityRadius (AR) is defined as the radial service range of a public transit stop, which captures the dependence of the users of the FRT stop to access the public transit facilities. In this study, we quantified the AR as the 90th and 95th percentile distances between various origins and the nearest FRT stops of completed trips. The results of a case study of the city of Morristown, Tennessee, US, indicate that after integration, the Gini index improved from 0.88 to 0.71, and 29.6 % more people had access to public transportation. The study also utilizes the AR performance metric to evaluate a recently developed transit integration project in Memphis, Tennessee, US. The results demonstrate a remarkable 224 % improvement in transit coverage Gap at an FRT stop. Therefore the contribution of this study is a framework to evaluate the accessibility and equity enhancement for a public transit system after integrating with on-demand feeder services.","Aravind, Avani","Venthuruthiyil, Suvin P.","Mishra, Sabyasachee",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,On-demand mobility,Fixed route transit,Equity,Accessibility,Accessibility-radius,,,,,,,DEC 2024,Equity and accessibility assessment of fixed route transit systems integrated with on-demand feeder services

Holding socio-demographic and travel-related factors constant, we find that perceptions of modespecific challenges significantly influence mode choices - while the degree of impairment alone, and related mobility aid needed, do not. Perceived limitations of the walking infrastructure shift MCPs' travel demand towards the bus, whereas bus fare-related issues encourage the use of non-motorized and powered three-wheelers. We recommend that mode choice models include latent variables related to MCPs' perceptions of various modes to more accurately inform universal access policies.","Mohiuddin, Hossain","Bhuiya, Md Musfiqur Rahman","Hasan, Md Musleh Uddin","Jamme, Hue -Tam",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Persons with disability,Mobility-challenged persons,Mode choice,Dhaka,Integrated choice and latent variables model,,,,,,,MAR 2024,How individual perceptions of transportation systems influence mode choice for mobility-challenged people: A case study in Dhaka using an integrated choice and latent variable model

It allows proper classification and comparison of different systems, using the societal goals as a cornerstone for its evaluation.

The lack of sufficient numbers of CPs has hindered EV adoption and negatively impacted the progress of sustainable mobility. We propose a CP distribution algorithm that is machine learning-based and leverages population density, points of interest (POIs), and the most used roads as input parameters to determine the best locations for deploying CPs. The objects of the following research are as follows: (1) to allocate weights to the three parameters in a 6 km by 10 km grid size scenario in Dublin in Ireland so that the best CP distribution is obtained; (2) to use a feedforward neural network (FNNs) model to predict the best parameter weight combinations and the corresponding CPs. CP deployment solutions are classified as successful when an EV is located within 100 m of a CP at the end of a trip. We find that (1) integrating the GEECharge and EV Portacharge algorithms with FNNs optimises the distribution of CPs; (2) the normalised optimal weights for the population density, POIs, and most used road parameters determined by this approach result in approximately 109 CPs being allocated in Dublin; (3) resizing the grid from 6 km by 10 km to 10 km by 6 km and rotating it at an angle of -350 degrees results in a 5.7% rise in the overall number of CPs in Dublin; (4) reducing the grid cell size from 1 km2 to 500 m2 reduces the mean distance between CPs and the EVs. This research is vital to city planners as we show that city planners can use readily available data to generate these parameters for urban planning decisions that result in EV CP networks, which have increased efficiency. This will promote EV usage in urban transportation, leading to greater sustainability.","Mutua, Alexander Mutiso","de Frein, Ruairi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,SUSTAINABILITY,electric vehicle charging points,charging infrastructure optimisation,charging point placement strategies,EV charging demand,machine learning,feedforward neural networks,sustainable urban planning,smart transport systems,range anxiety,optimisation of infrastructure,,NOV 2024,Sustainable Mobility: Machine Learning-Driven Deployment of EV Charging Points in Dublin
Row_217,"Public transport (PT) fare policy remains subject to innovations, not least evident in the Mobility as a Service discussion. Mode integration and related fare strategies can be used to increase the attractiveness of PT by compensating for potential delays. This study proposes ""premium fares"" as a novel pricing tool that can evaluate and improve the travel time reliability on a multimodal transportation network. The premium fare is higher than the standard fare but allows passengers to use an alternative service free of charge if waiting for the delayed public transport service is anticipated to be longer than a certain qualification threshold. Properties that guarantee monotonicity of the premium fare with respect to distance traveled are developed. The operator aims to find the premium fare price and qualification threshold that can maximize its profit, based on the probability distributions of delay and passengers' value of time (VOT). We model this optimization problem for a railway line given a limited capacity of alternative mode services, e.g., the number of taxis. A two-stage approach using nonlinear and dynamic programming is developed to obtain the optimal decision variables and associated capacity allocation plan. Our results show that the introduction of the premium fare can benefit both operators and travelers with increased profits and improved travel time reliability. The interplay between fares and the qualification threshold is illustrated using various delay and VOT distributions. To attract enough customers the premium fare has to be set below a specific level dependent on the VOT distribution. Meanwhile, the operator adjusts the qualification threshold to control the cost paid to the alternative service provider.","Zhou, Yihe","Sun, Wenzhe","Schmocker, Jan-Dirk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES,Travel time reliability,Delay insurance,Premium fare,Integrated multimodal transport,Public transport,Nonlinear and dynamic programming,,,,,,NOV 2024,Transit fares integrating alternative modes as a delay insurance

In this framework, the aim of the paper is to develop a methodological approach to support metropolitan city planning (policy target) through the combination of spatial autocorrelation of the different accessibility intensities (private and public) and social-material vulnerability index (SMVI).","Balletto, Ginevra","Sinatra, Martina","Borruso, Giuseppe","Sechi, Francesco","Fancello, Gianfranco",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"INNOVATION IN URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING, VOL 2, INPUT 2023",,Circular City,Urban Accessibility,Spatial autocorrelation,LISA,Metropolitan City Planning,,,,,,,2024,The Process of Metropolisation and Spatial Accessibility.

Row_220,"There has been a growing interest in autonomous vehicles (AVs) for the past few years due to technological innovation and their far-reaching expected impacts on urban mobility. The impact of AVs depends ultimately on how the technology will be adopted, e.g. privately or shared AVs (SAVs), and integrated into the socio-technical mobility system. In this study, we evaluate how social considerations and the AV technology may enhance new social arrangements for travel, especially for groups suffering from some disadvantages in accessing transport. Particularly, we explore a proposed new form of social arrangement, coined ""Travel Community"" (TC), to create shared AVs trips based on individual preferences. An online national representative sample in Israel was conducted (N = 1009). The data was analyzed using multivariate methods including multinomial logistic regression models for the willingness to adopt TC in two contexts: commuting (TCC) and travel leisure (TCL). The findings suggest that TC was well accepted by the participants under certain assumptions and could address latent demand for improving travel options for people with different constraints accessing transport, such as women, young, sporadic travelers, and low-income individuals. The personal social preferences option might help overcome psychological barriers regarding shared mobility, such as the fear of sharing the trip with strangers and a social value promoting a new kind of social interaction. Planners and stakeholders should consider social considerations' relevance (opportunities and risks) for promoting and creating new forms of mobility and improving urban sustainability and social inclusion.","Israel, Fabian","Plaut, Pnina",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,TRAVEL BEHAVIOUR AND SOCIETY,Mobility innovation,Change of travel habits,Social acceptance,Social inclusion,Automated Vehicles,,,,,,,APR 2024,The relevance of social factors in sharing a trip with strangers: Creating travel communities in the autonomous vehicles era

Once privacy concerns have been addressed, data can be handled and analysed in a proficient manner to gain insights into patterns and movements, thereby influencing urban policies. It is likely that mobility and transport-related topics have been the subject of the most extensive investigation in the field of cell phone big data. While the topic of commuting patterns has been extensively researched by numerous authors, there is a paucity of literature on the monitoring of attendance during major motorsport events. Despite the predictability of crowding (tickets are sold in advance and the schedule is fixed and rigid), multiday motorsport events are disruptive in terms of traffic, overcrowding and uneasiness for hosting cities. This paper aims to address the aforementioned gap by presenting a case study of monitoring attendance during the Formula One EmiliaRomagna and Made in Italy Grand Prix, held in Imola, Italy, from 22nd to 24th April 2022. The results demonstrated the potential of data to inform the prediction of mobility choices and the planning of appropriate mobility-related policies, with the aim of reducing the impact of future events.

We conducted a large-scale mobile measurement campaign and employed a gradient boost model to generate exposure surfaces using land use, built environment, and meteorological conditions. The Ontario Marginalization Index was used to quantify various indicators of social disadvantage for Toronto's neighborhoods. Our findings reveal that people in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas experience elevated UFP exposures. We highlight significant disparities in accessing sustainable transportation, particularly in areas with higher ethnic concentrations. When factoring in daily mobility, UFP exposure disparities in disadvantaged populations are further exacerbated. Furthermore, individuals who do not generate emissions themselves are consistently exposed to higher UFPs, with active transportation users experiencing the highest UFP exposures both at home and at activity locations. Finally, we proposed a novel index, the Community Prioritization Index (CPI), incorporating three indicators, including air quality, social disadvantage, and sustainable transportation.

Row_223,"One of the challenges to achieve sustainability in mobility, especially post-pandemic, is to analyse urban accessibility as a service for people, incorporating perceptions of (in)satisfaction with their displacements. This is possible by considering alternatives that inhabitants declare to improve this perception, expanding the analysis beyond aspects only linked to transportation. This research, applied in the territory of the Collao sector, belonging to the Metropolitan Area of Concepci & oacute;n, which, like other neighbourhoods of the city and the world, suffered a strong crisis of immobility as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, dramatically altering the conditions of accessibility of its inhabitants to basic services. The objective was to integrate the perceived accessibility before and during the pandemic with the (in)satisfaction, systematizing declared alternatives to improve it in both situations. The analysis used social geomarketing, obtaining data with declared surveys. Perceptions show walking and proximity as the main elements influencing satisfaction for both periods. Contrary to this, sidewalks in poor condition and vehicular congestion would be factors of dissatisfaction, added to health elements of the pandemic. Results also show that the alternatives declared to increase satisfaction could be implemented in their usual routes, coinciding with previously detected areas of spatial satisfaction. Conclusions remark that integrating scenarios proposed by people into the urban design is relevant in emergency situations.

Row_224,"Through a combination of regulations, fear of contagion, and changes in travelers' habits, the COVID-19 pandemic affected the mobility of public-transit ridership worldwide. To understand the longer-term effects of the pandemic on public-transit ridership, we focus on the case of Paris, France, thanks to an open 5 year record of entries into more than 500 stations. To deal with the large volume of data, we use a statistical model that performs clustering and segmentation simultaneously while incorporating many exogenous variables, such as the day of the week or lockdowns, to account for their effect on the number of entries. We carry out an in-depth analysis of the results for the segments and clusters. Examining and comparing the regression coefficients across clusters and consecutive segments allows us to draw per-cluster and per-segment conclusions. We show that the number of weekday trips decreased in most clusters and that the reduction in weekly variations is proportional to the share of weekday trips in the volume of entries before the pandemic. In addition, we characterize the changes in the weekly profile: Thursday was replaced by Tuesday as the day with the highest ridership; because of teleworking, Friday became the least crowded weekday in clusters with strong differences between weekdays and weekends, while the lowest ridership weekday remains Monday in the other clusters.","Moreau, Hugues","Come, Etienne","Same, Allou","Oukhellou, Latifa",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD,public transportation,light rail transit,rail transit systems,subway,urban,big data,smart-card data,,,,,OCT 2024,How Has the Paris Rail Public-Transportation Network Recovered After the COVID-19 Pandemic?

Row_225,"There has been a growing interest from public authorities around the world in implementing measures aimed at preventing through traffic in city centres and establishing car-free zones. One of these initiatives has recently been proposed by the City of Bergen, aiming to zone the city centre in such a way that, in the long run, only public transport and emergency vehicles can pass through. While the zoning is primarily focused on mobility to make the city centre more attractive to residents by reducing traffic and parking, its effects on freight delivery in relation to city liveability is not thoroughly discussed. This paper investigates the implications of this zoning decision on freight transport, offering authorities a broader understanding of its impact through the utilization of clustering and routing models of freight carriers at a holistic level. Our analysis reveals that alongside the anticipated increase in total driving for freight deliveries throughout the city, there would also be a rise in traffic within the city centre itself, which may not have been intended or expected. As a remedy, we analyse the effect of introducing a micro-hub for consolidation, and bicycles for the last mile delivery, another policy that is presently being considered by the city. Our study highlights the importance of integrating freight transport into decision-making processes from the initial stages, rather than treating it as a secondary concern relative to mobility.","Orhan, Cosku Can","Soman, Jaikishan","Wallace, Stein W.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,Freight in cities,Regulation,Zoning,A priori analysis,,,,,,,,JUL 2024,Disconnecting a city centre to prevent through traffic: An a priori evaluation with a focus on freight transport
Row_226,"There is no bigger problem in daily urban life other than traffic congestion in Metro Manila, the capital of the Philippines. With a population of around 13.5 million people in 2020, this metropolis is globally notorious for its 'carmageddon.' Its streets transform into giant parking lots, which entails the loss of time, productivity, and other vital resources. Car-centrism is at the core of this mobility problem. However, government solutions to the traffic problem are overly focused on infrastructure and technological interventions. In this article, we engage with how civil society plays a fundamental role in initiating and sustaining street experiments in constituent cities of Metro Manila and how they influence change in transport governance through utilising the (1) bibingka or sandwich approach and (2) acting as a 'critical friend.' We share an example of the bibingka approach through the Bayanihan sa Daan (Collective Heroism in the Road), a road-sharing initiative in the busy streets of the Ortigas business district in Pasig City, Metro Manila. Meanwhile, we present cases of how civil society organisations acted as a critical friend to initiate street experiments and reforms through organisational partnership or appointment of their members to positions in government transport agencies. Through these approaches, we show that civil society participation in initiating street experiments is critical to ensuring that solutions to the traffic problem contribute to the mobility of people rather than of cars. In this vein, we put forward street experiments as fundamental to ensuring just transitions towards realising mobility justice, especially in cities of the Global South.","Gatarin, Gina R.","Andal, Aireen Grace T.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF URBAN MOBILITY,Civil society,Just transitions,Metro manila,Road-sharing,Street experiments,Traffic,,,,,,JUN 2024,"Towards just transitions in cities of the Global South: Civil society and street experiments against the CARMAGEDDON in Metro Manila, Philippines"
Row_227,"While living in city centers is usually linked to higher accessibility levels, shorter travel times, and higher levels of public transit (PT) utilization, the opposite is true for residents of suburban areas. This assumption holds in metropolitan contexts, where central areas offer better accessibility and are associated with higher levels of PT use. In metropolitan peripheries, a large part of commuting is done on an interurban basis, so that the level of use of public transit can be linked to the supply and information available. This work aims to understand the conditions in terms of transit supply and land use, considering the most frequent trip, psychological variables, and the modal choice of commuters' motorized modes, in the intention to use the new real-time multi-modal travel app, such as advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) for digital mobility-management assistance. A Structural Equation Model is developed to empirically test a sample of 768 respondents collected in two suburban corridors in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (LMA). Finally, our findings indicate that residential location, mode choice, and trip complexity have a relevant influence on the intention to adopt travel apps. Male students belonging to Generation Y/Z are the most likely users of travel apps. Regardless of the reason, travel patterns associated with more complex (more transfers) and more frequent trips can reinforce the intention to use apps. Also, it is worth noting that students are frequent public transit users, and public transit is also related to trip complexity.","Amorim, Julianno de Menezes","de Abreu e Silva, Joao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,TRAVEL BEHAVIOUR AND SOCIETY,ATIS,Technophilia,Transit supply,Public transit,SEM,,,,,,,JAN 2025,The influence of residential location and public transit options on commuters' intention to use travel apps for different travel purposes
Row_228,"Cities implemented park-and-ride (PNR) systems to decrease congestion in dense urban areas while providing transit options to travelers who live in a city's low- to medium-density regions. The success of PNR systems is mixed, as they suffer from several disadvantages, namely, the uncertainty of parking locations and infrequent and/or unreliable transit services, and the fact that travelers still need to walk to their destination. Motivated by the premise of PNR systems and the potential of automated vehicles (AVs), to address each of the shortcomings of PNR systems, this study proposes a future system with near-ubiquitous AVs where travelers transfer from privately owned AVs (PAVs) to shared-use, shared-ride AVs (SAVs), called a PAV-SAV transfer system. This study proposes a modeling framework to assess the potential market share of the PAV-SAV transfer system and the network impacts (e.g., congestion, vehicle miles traveled) of the proposed system. Finally, the study identifies good designs for the PAV-SAV transfer system using scenario analysis. The critical design variables are the location of transfer stations, the capacity of SAVs, and the transfer station connector links. For the Greater Los Angeles area, the computational results show a market share for PAV-SAV of almost 18% for person trips terminating in downtown Los Angeles. In all scenarios, the proposed PAV-SAV system decreases vehicle hours traveled (VHT) across the whole network with significant decreases in the urban core. For all designs, the PAV-SAV system decreases vehicle miles traveled (VMT) compared to a network without PAV-SAV transfer stations, albeit only slightly. Locating transfer stations closer to the urban core, increasing vehicle capacities, and connecting transfer stations to both arterial links and highway links improves network performance (i.e., VMT and VHT) and increases the market share of the PAV-SAV system.","Bahk, Younghun","Hyland, Michael","An, Sunghi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,Autonomous Vehicles,Shared Mobility,Public Transport,Network Modeling,Innovative Mobility,,,,,,,MAR 2024,Re-envisioning the Park-and-Ride concept for the automated vehicle (AV) era with Private-to-Shared AV transfer stations

The specific objectives are to identify the full range of UAM's impacts on citizens' quality of life and to propose a set of indicators that enables the quantification and assessment of the identified impacts. Firstly, the main issues (focus areas) were identified, namely, noise, visual pollution, and privacy concerns, followed by access and equity, economic aspect, emissions, public safety, and impact on wildlife. In the next step, for each identified focus area, performance indicators were defined along with the several cross-cutting areas for a geographical, temporal, demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral resolution.

Row_230,"In the pursuit of sustainable mobility and the decarbonization of transport systems, public authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the impact of travel speed on emissions within both low-speed and high-speed environments. This study critically examines the evidence concerning emission impacts associated with speed limit changes in different traffic environments by conducting a systematic review of the literature in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 25 studies that met the eligibility criteria were assessed. The results reveal mixed evidence for reducing emissions through speed limit reductions in low-speed areas. However, emerging evidence suggests that reduced urban speeds may abate emissions through enhanced traffic flow and a shift in modal preferences away from personal vehicle use. Additionally, in urban areas, minor observed emission reduction per vehicle can add up to large overall reductions due to the high number of vehicles. In high-speed contexts, the evidence is much clearer, showing that reduced speed limits correlate with significant reductions in NOx, CO2, and particulate matter emissions. The extent of these reductions is highly variable and contingent upon the specific speed limits or limit reductions, the local context, the vehicle type, and the baseline types and levels of pollutants. Notably, there is a lack of research on the effects of speed on emissions, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), highlighting a critical area for future investigation. The findings of this study underscore the potential environmental benefits of speed management policies and advocate for the promotion of smoother and less aggressive driving behavior to mitigate emissions and enhance sustainable mobility in both low-speed and high-speed settings.","Fondzenyuy, Stephen Kome","Turner, Blair Matthew","Burlacu, Alina Florentina","Jurewicz, Chris","Usami, Davide Shingo","Feudjio, Steffel Ludivin Tezong","Persia, Luca",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,SUSTAINABILITY,sustainable mobility,speed management,emissions,speed limits,eco-driving,,,,,,,SEP 2024,The Impact of Speed Limit Change on Emissions: A Systematic Review of Literature

Taking Changsha City as a case study, the carbon reduction potential of SEB is evaluated by analyzing different travel scenarios. The results show that urban transportation carbon emissions can be reduced by about 3.3% under the SEB travel alternative scenario. Compared to infrastructure development or private car restriction scenarios, the SEB alternative is more viable and sustainable. SEB exhibits advantages over other public transportation in alleviating urban transportation burdens and reducing emissions.

Row_233,"Scholars and policymakers increasingly are presenting the moped as part of a transition to more sustainable modes. However, the question remains as to where moped users should ride-as they often compete for space with other sustainable modes such as cycling or walking. This study focuses on the Netherlands, known as a cycling paradise, where mopeds share the cycling infrastructure. This has sparked controversies about spatial conflicts between moped users and cyclists, especially since the emergence of e-moped rental systems in 2017. Drawing on mobility studies and social identity theory, this paper explores the stereotypes of moped users and their behaviours to understand the spatial complexities of a shift towards more micromobility in the Netherlands. By analysing interviews with moped users and how users are discussed in the press, the paper empirically maps stereotypes of the users of different mopeds i.e. (1) fuel-based and privately owned, (2) electric and privately owned, and (3) electric and rental, and their behaviour on the bicycle path. Our study shows how debates tend to focus on the behaviours of moped users and their interactions with cyclists on shared bicycle paths while the spatial domination of automobility remains unchallenged. This paper contributes to transport behaviour research on spatial conflicts and identities in the context of the rise of micromobility - a key pillar of transitions to more sustainable mobility, alongside other changes such as fleet electrification, reduction of car use, and increased public transport uptake. Micromobilities entail what was traditionally understood as active mobility or non-motorised transport, such as cycling, but also what is now often discussed under the umbrella of MaaS or (light) electric vehicles, such as motorised two-wheelers, and also 'hybrids' such as e-bikes, fatbikes or cargo bikes. This paper exemplifies how identities, stereotypes and behaviours are relevant for understanding interactions around these modes and debates, in the quest towards low-car urban transitions.","Glachant, Clara","Behrendt, Frauke",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART F-TRAFFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR,Travel behaviour,Mopeds,Social identity,Mobility transition,Bicycle path,Micromobility,,,,,,NOV 2024,Negotiating the bicycle path: A study of moped user stereotypes and behaviours in the Netherlands
Row_234,"Perimeter control (PC) of urban traffic networks can be effective in increasing network-wide efficiency. PC operates on the border of a protected region of a traffic network. Most studies thus far considered fixed-time plans for the inner part of these regions. A few studies have shown that combining PC with locally actuated or decentralized traffic control systems may have positive effects on traffic performance, including better-defined Network Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams (NMFDs), increased network throughput, and reduced delays. The Traffic-responsive Urban Control (TUC) is a real-time network-wide traffic control system with particular design characteristics, such as the balancing of link's occupancies and an inherent gating feature. These characteristics suggest that TUC may enhance the traffic network performance when combined with PC whilst improving the resulting NMFDs and network throughput and delays. In this work, we investigate the effect of feedback perimeter control (FPC), TUC, and their combination on the NMFD and on the traffic conditions of general traffic and public transport in the microsimulation of a realistic model of the Christchurch Central Business District in New Zealand. We perform a thorough investigation of practical aspects of both control strategies and their combination, including parameter tuning and infrastructure requirements, and how they may affect the control system choice. Results show higher throughput and less hysteresis on the NMFDs, particularly when TUC is involved. PC provides benefits concentrated in the protected region which can greatly benefit public transportation if there is an overlap with the transit network.

Row_235,"Transportation accessibility, or the ease of reaching valued destinations, is a critical determinant of a person's ability to satisfy their essential needs. A lack of accessibility can result in travel burdens such as high transportation costs or unmet needs and adversely affect well-being. Prior research establishes the inverse relationship between travel burdens and access to transportation options such as public transit and proximity to destinations as well as a person's resources, including their income and access to a personal vehicle. Although travel behavior is understood to differ across rural versus urban contexts, little is known about the nature of travel burdens in rural communities. Using the 2017 National Household Travel Survey, this study quantifies and compares travel burdens in rural versus nonrural communities in the United States. In each context, we quantify and compare i) the magnitude of travel burdens, ii) who experiences travel burdens, and iii) the individual and environmental factors that are associated with travel burdens. We find higher rates of burdensome travel outcomes among rural residents. People who live in rural areas are more likely to report burdensome travel costs and unmet travel needs due to a lack of transportation options compared to people living in nonrural areas, and these differences are exacerbated for people without car access. Dispersed rural contexts are unique in that they exhibit a combination of higher rates of financial burden and unmet need relative to urban contexts. Within rural areas, financial burdens and unmet need are less prevalent for those who live in a small town when compared with those living in more dispersed areas, which suggests that even a small concentration of services and opportunities may facilitate greater access. Collectively, our results highlight the need for research that attends to contextspecific needs and strategies to address travel burdens in rural communities.","Espeland, Sierra","Rowangould, Dana",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Unmet need,Transport disadvantage,Rural,Transportation equity,Mobility,,,,,,,DEC 2024,Rural travel burdens in the United States: Unmet need and travel costs

However, restorative environments research currently lacks theory and empirical evidence on gendered restorative processes. Literature on epidemiology has studied gender differences in greenspaces and mental health outcomes but results are unclear so far. In parallel, social psychology of gender and feminist urbanism suggest that gender-related socio-cultural norms, attitudes, and behaviours; roles and relations; stereotypes, expressions; identity and sexual orientation, as well as certain sex-related factors, can have profound influences on women's (and gender minorities') experiences in public space. Drawing from these disciplines, we address this key knowledge gap of restorative environments research by reviewing the role of gender and sex in psychological restoration and wider psychological experiences in urban greenspaces. The findings reveal that gender-related and certain sex-related factors can affect aspects of person-greenspaces interactions, including when greenspaces are accessed and where; why they are visited and with whom; and how greenspaces are experienced. Several potential barriers to women's and gender minorities' experiences in urban greenspaces are identified. These relate to visit characteristics (transport accessibility and mobility patterns, frequency, time, social context and purpose of visits), experiences of contextual features (perceived and objective safety, the quality and maintenance of urban greenspace, infrastructure features), and several top-down person and group-based experiences (personal meanings, majority dynamics and group belonging, intersecting sociodemographic and personal characteristics). Overall, the person-environment fit in urban greenspaces might be lower for women and gender minorities than for men. This might translate into lower perceptions of compatibility and being away and, simultaneously, higher attentional demands. Overall, this might reduce the restorative and psychological benefits of urban greenspaces for women and gender minorities. Future research is encouraged to assess empirically the effects of the identified gender- and sex-related factors in restorative experiences of urban greenspaces, as well as to explore restorative experiences among specific socio-demographic groups in which gender intersects with other personal and social features.","Bornioli, Anna","Hopkins-Doyle, Aife","Fasoli, Fabio","Faccenda, Giulio","Subiza-Perez, Mikel","Ratcliffe, Eleanor","Beyazit, Eda",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,Sex and the city park: The role of gender and sex in psychological restoration in urban greenspaces

Row_239,"In recent years, e-scooters have been introduced in many European cities. In several places we have witnessed a rapid uptake of this new mode of transport mainly as a result of public sharing schemes. A number of incidents, injuries and even fatalities have given rise to questions regarding the safety of these vehicles. These questions are being researched mainly using official crash data and data specifying injuries and hospital treatment. Until now, the research has focused on investigating typical injury patterns and estimating risk levels. Very little is known about exactly where conflicts and crashes occur. Knowledge of hazard hotspots is crucial when investigating risk levels and improving safety for all road users. Hence, this paper develops an approach to investigating locations with potentially dangerous interactions within the active mobility system in the city of Berlin. The approach consists of explorative expert interviews, an online poll, and quantitative analyses. For the latter we combine three datasets. First, we research crash hotspots using official data. Second, we use data based on acceleration sensors from cyclists' smartphones to find locations of sudden movements. Third, we use trip data from the operators of escooter sharing systems.

Row_241,"The sharing economy, mobile Internet, and smartphones have been widely utilized in recent years to promote the development of bike-sharing services. Bike-sharing serves as a first/last mile travel mode to connect to public transit, which improves trip efficiency, alleviates traffic problems, improves environmental quality, and promotes public health. However, the substitution of public transit by bike-sharing and the decline in public transit ridership have raised concerns among city managers regarding the coopetition between shared mobility services and public transit. To understand the impact of bike-sharing on the decline in public transit and to formulate reasonable synergistic development policies, it is crucial to identify the coopetition relationships between the two. This paper uses a combination of database search and backward snowballing to review existing research. Three research themes were identified: macrolevel studies on bike-sharing and public transit interaction, studies on actual coopetition behaviors based on bike-sharing user surveys, and studies on potential coopetition relationships based on bike-sharing transaction data. The three categories of studies reveal the effect of bike-sharing usage on public transit ridership, the emergency function of bike-sharing in the event of unexpected transit shutdowns, and the substitution and connection relationships between bike-sharing and public transit and the factors influencing them. Finally, this study suggests many directions for future research. This review helps clarify the understanding of the coopetition relationships between bike-sharing and public transit, provides theoretical support to promote the synergistic development of both, and points out ways to deepen the research on the coopetition relationship between the two.","Ye, Jianhong","Bai, Jiahao","Hao, Wenyang",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 16 2024,A Systematic Review of the Coopetition Relationship between Bike-Sharing and Public Transit
Row_242,"Current accessibility measures assume that all people are the same, whereas in reality there are many different user groups with different needs and perceptions. Furthermore, the concepts of walking accessibility and walkability are often analysed independently from each other. This leads to a mismatch between calculated accessibility and perceived accessibility. This paper seeks to propose a new methodological approach that considers user-specific perceptions and walkability needs when calculating pedestrian accessibility. A Perceived user-specific Accessibility measure for Walking (PAW) is developed for four sample user groups: seniors, children, women, and wheelchair users. This is done by adjusting the Geo Open Accessibility Tool (GOAT) and imputing the perceptions. Per user group, the most important walkability attributes are therefore included in the accessibility formula and weighted according to their relevance based on the literature review using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. Results for a district of Munich, Germany are visualised. When juxtaposed with conventional time-based accessibility measures, our results unveil a more nuanced understanding of pedestrian infrastructure and its variabilities across different user demographics. This approach can help to provide a more realistic portrayal of pedestrian accessibility and to uncover critical gaps in current infrastructure, tailored to the needs of diverse population groups. The method can assist urban and transport planners in designing more inclusive, equitable urban environments. This contributes to a shift towards cities that are not only walkable but also attuned to the diverse needs and perceptions of their residents, ultimately enhancing quality of life and promoting equitable access to urban amenities.","Jehle, Ulrike","Larriva, Maria Teresa Baquero","Baghaiepoor, Mahtab","Buettner, Benjamin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,Perceived accessibility,Walkability,Walking accessibility,User groups,Imputed perception,,,,,,,NOV 2024,How does pedestrian accessibility vary for different people?

Row_243,"The ""15-minute city"" concept has been receiving an increasing amount of attention as a model for urban policy as well as a tool for urban spatial analysis. The concept is often considered an urban planning ideal that can effectively contribute to improved accessibility and a more sustainable mobility. Through a sustainability, equity, and livability lens, this paper examines pitfalls of the 15-minute city from a theoretical and spatial analysis perspective and proposes alternative theoretical and methodological directions. The seven pitfalls of the 15-minute city in current literature are summarized as: (1) overstatement of the 15-minute city's originality, (2) strong decentralization proposed by the 15-minute city theory is unrealistic and unsustainable, (3) focusing on quantity of destinations instead of sufficiency, (4) improperly aggregating facilities, (5) neglecting diverse forms of nature and their characteristics, (6) disregarding public transport in 15-minute city theory or spatial analysis, and (7) ignoring interpersonal differences in walking and cycling when conducting analyses based on the 15-minute city. A set of strategies is proposed to address these pitfalls and reorient the 15-minute city towards improved environmental and societal outcomes.","Mouratidis, Kostas",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,CITIES,15-minute city,Sustainable cities,Livable cities,Accessibility,Sustainable mobility,Compact city,,,,,,OCT 2024,"Time to challenge the 15-minute city: Seven pitfalls for sustainability, equity, livability, and spatial analysis"

Many people without regular access to automobiles depend on public transit as their main mode of transportation. Shared bikes represent a significant opportunity to improve transit accessibility but have issues with low-density and inequitable distribution of services, typically in low-income areas. This study develops a method to estimate transit service supply within a region with micromobility using bus schedule and bike station location data. A bi-objective optimization model is developed and applied to Pittsburgh, USA as a case study, to illuminate how stakeholder preferences towards equity (i.e., improving mobility access for disadvantaged communities) impacts the design of docked bike share systems. Results indicate that bike share systems can significantly improve public transit supply within a region, particularly in neighborhoods that have bike stations deployed. High preference for equity enables disadvantaged communities to have greater access to transit routes, and a neutral preference for equity can help bridge transit supply disparities among population groups. Network connectivity constraints of bike share system necessitates a large number of stations to achieve comprehensive coverage of an urban area.","Fan, Zhufeng","Harper, Corey D.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Equity,Micromobility,Public transit,Optimization,,,,,,,,FEB 2024,Taking a multimodal approach to equitable bike share station siting
Row_245,"Public transport priority systems such as Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and Buses with High Level of Service (BHLS) are top-rated solutions to mobility in low-income and middle-income cities. There is scientific agreement that the safety performance level of these systems depends on their functional, operational, and infrastructure characteristics. However, there needs to be more evidence on how the different characteristics of bus corridors might influence safety. This paper aims to shed some light on this area by structuring a multivariate negative binomial model comparing crash risk on arterial roads, BRT, and BHLS corridors in Bogota, Colombia. The analyzed infrastructure includes 712.1 km of arterial roads with standard bus service, 194.1 km of BRT network, and 135.6 km of BHLS network. The study considered crashes from 2015 to 2018 -fatalities, injuries, and property damage only- and 30 operational and infrastructure variables grouped into six classes -exposure, road design, infrastructure, public means of transport, and land use. A multicriteria process was applied for model selection, including the structure and predictive power based on [i] Akaike information criteria, [ii] K-fold cross-validation, and [iii] model parsimony. Relevant findings suggest that in terms of observed and expected accident rates and their relationship with the magnitude of exposure -logarithm of average annual traffic volumes at the peak hour (LOG_AAPHT) and the percentage of motorcycles, cars, buses, and trucks- the greatest risk of fatalities, injuries, and property damage occurs in the BHLS network. BRT network provides lower crash rates in less severe collisions while increasing injuries and fatalities. When comparing the BHLS network and the standard design of arterial roads, BHLS infrastructure, despite increasing mobility benefits, provides the lowest safety performance among the three analyzed networks. Individual factors of the study could also contribute to designing safer roads related to signalized intersection density and curvature. These findings support the unique characteristics and traffic dynamics present in the context of Bogota that could inform and guide decisions of corresponding authorities in other highly dense urban areas from developing countries.","Garcia, M.

Row_246,"Recent years have seen a rapid deployment of shared electric scooters (e-scooters), across hundreds of cities worldwide. Despite the global diffusion, most urban residents are still not using e-scooters, and they often bear the negative consequences of e- scooter deployment. This comparative study investigates the attitudes and characteristics of the e-scooter non-users in Helsinki, Finland and Tokyo, Japan using latent class clustering analysis. Our findings reveal five classes of e-scooter non-users, ranging from very negative perspectives to the least negative perspectives towards e-scooter deployment. Non-users also have a diverse set of sociodemographics background, including variation across age, gender, and income. In addition, non-users mostly do not feel the necessity of using an e-scooter as well as lack competences and have safety concerns. Safety concerns are dominant among those with more negative perceptions, while classes with the least negative perceptions and low income tend to not use e-scooters due to high rental costs. Understanding the different categories and perspectives of non-users, alongside with understanding users, has clear smart mobility policy and management implications. On the one hand, it should help with understanding the effectiveness of different interventions stemming from e-scooter operators and public policy actors. On the other hand, this study's findings contribute to understanding public acceptability of e-scooter technology and associated policy and management actions. The study also opens further pathways for both comparative studies and for understanding different groups of users and non-users of smart mobility technologies.","Dibaj, Samira","Keiichi, Hizaki","Goto, Rie","Taniguchi, Ayako","Mladenovic, Milos N.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,TRAVEL BEHAVIOUR AND SOCIETY,Emerging mobility technology,Electro-mobility,Micromobility,Personal mobility device,Rental e -scooters,E -scooter non-rider,,,,,,APR 2025,Latent class approach to classify e-scooter non-users: A comparative study of Helsinki and Tokyo

Row_248,"The COVID-19 pandemic triggered significant changes in sustainable mobility in many large and well-known cities of the Global North, such as Paris, Milan or New York. Soon, various large Latin American cities followed suit, taking advantage of this global trend that included significant street experiments. However, it is less clear how these changes affected intermediate cities in this large region and how the population perceived these changes. This paper analyzes the series of street experiments developed in Chilean intermediate cities during the COVID-19 pandemic. We intend to analyze to what extent intermediate cities have engaged in street experimentations and to examine the perceptions associated to street experiments. To this purpose, we surveyed public officials from Chilean intermediate cities and then focused on examining the street experiments developed in Quilpue ', a city located 125 km west of Santiago. The results showed that 9 of the 10 intermediate cities surveyed carried out interventions, with the emergency bicycle lane being the most frequent measure, followed by the widening of sidewalks. These were located in areas of high pedestrian flows and were mostly financed by own funds and ministerial funds. However, the main difficulty encountered was budgetary. In the case of Quilpue ', shopkeepers have a rather negative view of the process, which was perceived as not very inclusive and participatory, with harmful consequences for the operation of their businesses. These results show that, to be more successful and gain long-term recognition, street experiments should pay more attention to community involvement, especially in small urban areas with deeprooted auto-centric ways of thinking.","Vasquez, Luis","Mora, Rodrigo","Vecchio, Giovanni","Tiznado-Aitken, Ignacio",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,JOURNAL OF URBAN MOBILITY,Street experiments,Intermediate cities,COVID interventions,Community engagement,Active mobility,,,,,,,JUN 2024,Street experiments in intermediate cities: scope and perceptions of COVID-19 interventions
Row_249,"Bicycle-metro integration, in which bicycling is used as a flexible feeder mode to connect with public transport nodes presents new opportunities for sustainable transportation. It is known that the built environment can influence travel attitudes and choice, yet the empirical evidence for the role of built environment features in shaping the bicycle-metro integration remains rare. Inspired by the idea of text mining, this article is an attempt to demonstrate a data-driven semantic framework to capture key topic-based features of land use and bicycle-metro integrated usage in the vicinity of metro stations as well as their interactions. Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling is analogously implemented here to generate a range of probability-based land use patterns and mobility patterns, and the associations between them are investigated by multivariate linear regression. A case study from Shanghai shows that the mixed land use and diversification of urban functions in the catchment areas of the metro stations can be detected effectively by 11 identified land use patterns. Based on 7 derived mobility patterns, this paper gives a probabilistic explanation to the time-varying properties of the bicycle-metro usage. All of the above thematic topics exhibit notably heterogeneous patterns in spatial distribution. The topic compositions in terms of land use pattern and mobility pattern at the station level reveal the current performance of station areas. Plus, results from the regression analysis confirm that most of the land use patterns that are related to various mixed use have close relationships with mobility patterns of bicycle-metro integration. Yet it is noteworthy that the effects of land use patterns often differ and change over time, namely affecting different mobility patterns. This study gives rise to alternative insights into the synergy between bike sharing and metro, which may help policymakers to develop more targeted TOD strategies.","Bi, Hui","Gao, Hui","Li, Aoyong","Ye, Zhirui",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,Bike sharing,Bicycle -metro integration,Built environment,Topic model,Transport policy,,,,,,,JUL 2024,Using topic modeling to unravel the nuanced effects of built environment on bicycle-metro integrated usage
Row_250,"Car-free development has become popular in recent years due to concerns regarding transport-related health issues in urban areas as well as a growing trend toward sustainability and environmentally friendly living. Although car-free development is regarded as progress to promote active transport modes and healthier cities, the accessibility impacts for its residents remain unclear. To address this knowledge gap, this paper proposes a job accessibility assessment framework that integrates individual and household socio-demographic characteristics into a job accessibility assessment, making it possible to account for commuting preferences of different population groups in accessibility analyses. For this purpose, a stated choice survey was conducted in existing low-car areas in the Netherlands to determine transport use and perception of public transport trip characteristics. Then, the influence of socio-demographic characteristics on trip perceptions was analyzed using a Latent Class Logit (LCL) regression model and Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, a multi-modal transport network combining walking and public transport trips was used to assess potential job accessibility levels of different population groups in a car-free development area. The proposed framework was implemented in a case study in the province of Utrecht (the Netherlands). Results show notable differences between the job accessibility levels within different population groups, reflecting distinct perceptions toward commuting trip characteristics based on socio-demographic characteristics and demonstrating the suitability of the applied approach to assess accessibility levels in car-free development areas. Compared to the sample average distribution, more than 15% lower accessibility levels were observed for starters (age 18-35) in some urban areas, indicating the aversion to longer and more expensive commuting trips. Contrarily, increased accessibility levels for families (>2 persons in household) were observed, demonstrating the acceptance to experience longer commuting travel times and additional costs. No differences were observed between accessibility levels of the sample average and senior adults (age >50).","Meester, Rutger","Ulak, Mehmet Baran","Geurs, Karst T.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT AND LAND USE,Car-free development,utility-based accessibility,latent-class logit model,potential job accessibility,,,,,,,,2024,A framework to include socio-demographic characteristics in potential job accessibility levels in low-car and car-free development areas in the Netherlands

Row_252,"Climate change and emissions reduction are crucial global issues that require transformations in the energy and transportation sectors. This has increased Electric Vehicles (EVs) adoption in various countries, including emerging economies like Colombia. The government in Colombia has implemented incentives and regulations to promote sustainable mobility, increasing the number of EVs and hybrids. However, beyond governmental incentives, factors such as range, availability of charging stations, and acquisition costs impact EV adoption. Therefore, vehicle owners must evaluate total ownership costs over time and technical aspects to understand EVs financial and performance advantages. In this context, a methodology is proposed to facilitate decision-making by comparing technical, economic, and environmental aspects of vehicle technologies in a specific urban transportation context. A case study for individual public transportation in Pasto, an intermediate city in Colombia (Pasto), is presented, which can be extrapolated to other cities with similar characteristics. This methodology supports governmental efforts for transport decarbonization and aims to inform cab owners about the economic benefits of new technological adoptions. The case study constructs a spatial model for individual public transportation simulated in SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility). By evaluating technical, economic, and environmental aspects with a realistic approach based on simulation results that considered traffic conditions and network operational parameters, helpful benchmarking is obtained to promote EVs among owners of public vehicles in the city and concludes that EV adoption for individual public transportation in Pasto is notably advantageous from a financial perspective.","Espana, Nohora","Murillo-Hoyos, Jackeline","Caicedo, Eduardo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH INTERDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVES,Electric vehicles,Internal combustion engine vehicles,Technical evaluation,Economic evaluation,Environmental evaluation,Individual public transportation,,,,,,MAR 2024,Methodology for the comparative evaluation of vehicle technologies in intermediate cities considering electric vehicles

The current study focuses on tourism mobility in the metropolitan city of Cagliari, the largest urban area in Sardinia, and aims to explore how much the existing and planned cycling routes constitute an alternative mobility solution for tourists who intend to reach the beaches. In particular, the study aims to evaluate the level of accessibility offered by bicycling to the beaches, which are among the most visited and attractive places for tourists, before and after the implementation of a regional bike tourism network system. A GIS-based procedure was employed and the method comprised of three main steps: (1) data collection and preparation, (2) GIS analysis, and (3) assessment of results. We performed two main types of analysis using GIS. First, we delineated service areas around each beach for various distances. Then, we overlaid and analyzed these areas in conjunction with the accommodation facilities. Second, we measured the accessibility of beaches using a gravity-based accessibility index.

Row_258,"Public transit services, which provide a critical lifeline for many essential workers, were severely interrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic. As institutions gradually return to normal in-person operations, it is critical to understand how the pandemic affected essential workers' commute and what it will take to ensure the effective recovery of transit ridership and enhance the long-term resiliency and equity of public transportation systems for those who need it the most. This study used focus group discussions with essential workers who were pre- pandemic transit riders to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted their commute perceptions, experiences, motives, and challenges and explore the potential changes in their travel behavior post-pandemic. We used NVivo 12 Pro to conduct a thematic analysis of the transcripted discussion data and examined patterns of commute mode change with respect to participants' attributes, including job type, home location, and gender. The results show that public transit had multiple reliability and frequency challenges during the pandemic, which resulted in most participants switching away from public transportation. With the increased availability of hybrid remote work and pandemic-related parking policies, driving emerged as a safer and more affordable commute mode for many pre-pandemic transit riders, rendering transit services less efficient for those who continued to rely on it. Planning for post-COVID resilient and reliable mobility requires a major rethinking of providing an efficient and effective transport system and a more fundamental approach to long-term public transport policy. To recover transit ridership, transit agencies need to ensure transit service availability and provide reliable transit information through smartphone apps. Similarly, transit agencies need to coordinate with other employers to provide free or heavily subsidized transit passes, to facilitate the recovery of transit demand effectively.","Abu Ashour, Lamis","Shen, Qing","Moudon, Anne","Cai, Mingming","Wang, Yiyuan","Brown, Melissa",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Essential workers,Commute,Public transit,Focus group discussions,COVID-19 pandemic,Post-pandemic,,,,,,APR 2024,Post-pandemic transit commute: Lessons from focus group discussions on the experience of essential workers during COVID-19

Recently, European cities have undergone substantial changes, and suburbanisation is posing new challenges. Suburban areas are often more affordable in terms of housing, but these neighbourhoods tend to be car-oriented. This leads to higher commuter costs, immobility, transport and time poverty, pollution, higher accident rates and a lack of social interactions.

Despite the positive results, considerable disparities exist between the inner and outer city, with a notable decline in sustainable mobility practices in the latter, due to the uneven distribution of basic services and uneven provision of public transport, together with lower density areas. Our results demonstrate that this uneven distribution reduces the available sequence profiles of inhabitants. In conclusion, the promotion of sustainable mobility policies necessitates further advances in transport, city and land-use planning that consider equity, gender, the socioeconomic profiles of citizens and mixed urban planning.","Montero, Lidia","Mejia-Dorantes, Lucia","Barcelo, Jaume",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,SUSTAINABILITY,travel behaviour,sequence analysis,equity,clustering,spatial analysis,gender,,,,,,OCT 2024,"Land Use, Travel Patterns and Gender in Barcelona: A Sequence Analysis Approach"
Row_261,"The park-and-ride (P&R) system is crucial for urban development and mobility as its strategic location helps to reduce congestion, reduce pollution, and encourage the use of public transport. Various methods have been proposed to determine its optimal location, ranging from algorithms and mathematical equations to multi-criteria approaches that consider a set of criteria and sub-criteria. Multi-criteria methods are diverse, and it is essential to know which methods have been applied to the optimal location of a P&R system. This study addresses the existing gaps in multi-criteria methods used in the localization of a P&R system through a systematic review based on the PRISMA protocol, examining 25 articles published between 2014 and 2024 in Science Direct, Scopus, and Web of Science (WOS). The results highlight that the multi-criteria AHP method is the most relevant and widely used. The criterion of accessibility to public transport is the most important criterion for setting up a P&R system in an urban environment. The flexibility of the multi-criteria AHP method, combined with other factors, makes it relevant in the process of P&R locations. However, the multi-criteria methods found in this research show that a wide range of multi-criteria methods have not yet been applied. Future research should focus on developing comprehensive systems that combine multiple multi-criteria methods, which is essential to optimize mobility solutions adapted to the specific characteristics and objectives of each city in establishing a P&R system.","Palaguachi, Juan","Padilla, Monserrath","Ortega, Martin","Solorzano, Marco Romero","Uvidia, Ruffo Villa","Ortega, Jairo","Veloz-Cherrez, Diego",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,SUSTAINABILITY,park and ride,systematic review,multi-criteria,transportation,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,Evaluating the Location of the Park-and-Ride System Using Multi-Criteria Methods: A Systematic Review
Row_262,"Public Transit (PT) systems aim to provide social, economic, and environmental benefits to modern cities offering reliable transportation service to users and ultimately reducing the problems related to traffic externalities due to car dependency. With the growing trend of urbanization and the associated phenomenon of cities' sprawl being increasingly evident, significant attention should be given to understanding PT systems' performance and then improving their efficiency. Considering the spatial characteristics of the PT system's performance promotes the environmentally friendly transport ""character"" that every city endeavors. This paper aims to incorporate the spatial spillover effects of a realistic PT system by augmenting information about the service network along with socio-economic variables, in a spatial demand-supply econometric framework. In detail, geographically separated demand and supply information on bus stops and lines was analyzed by a spatial econometric model, namely, the Spatial Lagged X (SLX) model which may be formatted so that can soundly handle, spatial and -in particular- network data like those coming from the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) protocol widely used in PT systems. The novelty and the importance of the proposed model rely on the ability to introduce transit network structure within the framework of spatial econometric regression, fostering the explanatory statistical analysis over networked information. The developed modeling approach was applied to the urban and rural PT system of Nicosia (Cyprus), incorporating the spatial spillover effects of the system over more than 1,500 bus stops, 40 lines, and 252 different but spatially connected postcode areas. The results of the SLX model were compared with other demand models of this form typically used, namely the Ordinary Least Square model and standard Spatial Autoregressive models, providing solid evidence of the benefits of incorporating the network structure in spatial demand modeling, giving valuable input for further planning purposes.","Nikolaou, Paraskevas","Dimitriou, Loukas",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,JOURNAL OF URBAN MOBILITY,Spatial analysis,Transport demand,Transit networks,Spatial lagged X model,General transit feed specification,,,,,,,DEC 2024,Spillover effects in transit networks: A parameterized weight matrix spatial lagged approach
Row_263,"Although many cities are incentivizing non-auto modes of transportation in response to the climate crisis, their sustainable mobility transition efforts are being challenged by the rising intensity and frequency of heatwaves. Pedestrians are exposed to high levels of heat stress on hot days, which may reduce their willingness to walk. It is thus important to understand how heat affects pedestrian behavior and accessibility, so that climate mitigation strategies can be better targeted to support walking as a mode of transport but also as a first-/last-mile connection to public transit. In this study, we used a dataset of pedestrian trips undertaken during the summer of 2014 in Boston, MA. Along with several route attributes (such as length, turns, sidewalk width, amenities, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and Sky View Factor), we also included a measure of heat stress (Universal Thermal Climate Index - UTCI) to explain pedestrian route choice behavior. Using path-size logistic regression models, we found evidence to suggest that heat stress has a considerable and statistically significant effect on the perceived walking distance. We also found that the effect was non-uniform and possibly exponential. Additionally, we illustrated the extent to which heat stress can reduce pedestrian accessibility to important destinations (such as public transit). This reduction was significant on a typical summer day, with an even sharper reduction on the hottest summer day. Non-White residents were observed to have lower accessibility levels compared to all pedestrians, likely because of disparities in urban heat exposure. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating heat exposure into transportation planning and urban design frameworks, especially with an equity lens to address unequal consequences.","Basu, Rounaq","Colaninno, Nicola","Alhassan, Aziz","Sevtsuk, Andres",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,CITIES,Heat stress,Thermal comfort,Willingness to walk,Pedestrian route choice,Accessibility,,,,,,,DEC 2024,Hot and bothered: Exploring the effect of heat on pedestrian route choice behavior and accessibility
Row_264,"The world's transportation system is overburdened by ever-growing travel demand, which brings mobility, safety, and pollution problems. To combat these issues and make better use of existing road capacity on urban arterials, public transit buses are designed to carry more people in fewer vehicles. However, transit buses travel slowly and make frequent intermittent stops, resulting in unreliable travel times and inconvenient riding experiences; this hinders people from choosing to travel on public transit buses. However, a research gap exists in using connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technologies specifically for transit bus operation optimization. To bridge this gap, the present study extended CAV applications to transit bus operation and developed a transit bus control method based on cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC). The proposed model first optimized bus segment speeds to minimize schedule deviations and fuel consumption. Then, a CACC algorithm was integrated with optimal segment speed. The proposed control method was implemented through micro-simulations of an actual corridor in Jinan, Shandong, China. The evaluation results indicate that the proposed control method reduced the total arrival deviation up to 65.1% and total fuel consumption up to 6.8%. The study adapts CAV technologies to transit bus operation. The findings in this study validate CAV applications in transit bus operation.","Wang, Xu","Yu, Di","Xue, Bingbing","Ma, Fei","Dai, Rongjian",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION,Cooperative adaptive cruise control,Public transit,Transit bus operation,Transit bus arrival punctuality,,,,,,,,2024,Exploring the effects of cooperative adaptive cruise control-based transit bus operation on signalized corridors

Literature shows that most previous efforts on this topic rely on surveys and limited data. In contrast to other works, in this paper, we present an innovative methodology for characterizing last-mile freight transportation that uses a novel and copious data source: mobile phone data, which provides a broader scope. Our methodology involves calibrating supervised machine-learning models that allow us to link cell phones with truck drivers. In this endeavor, we construct several input variables that track mobile phone's daily movement patterns, including traveled distances, interactions with highway networks, and land use variables. We test our approach by conducting a case study in Santiago, Chile, for which we analyze mobility patterns and logistics indicators disaggregated by day, hour, and zoning. For this case, we show that all supervised models performed well regarding AUC, which can be attributed to the high granularity and handling of the data. However, we chose to use NGBoost in all subsequent experiments, as it provided slightly better results on our validation data. Our work has several implications for practice. For instance, our results can support decision-makers and policymakers in identifying critical areas where urban logistics centers and transportation interventions are needed.

This is one of the first studies to explore transit-to-parks experiences in large urban regions. We conducted interviews with 25 diverse transit riders. Motivations for riding transit to parks included environmental concerns and the convenience of avoiding parking and traffic. Constraints involved excessive travel time due to limited service, transit frequency and reliability issues, and last-mile connection issues. The main negotiation strategy was to plan trips to limit travel time. People in low-income neighborhoods had limited transit-to-parks services, and available services were adequate for fit and nondisabled people. Policy changes that would help participants address constraints included new or modified routes, improved last-mile connections, information and marketing campaigns, and better service for low-income communities and people with disabilities.","Rigolon, Alessandro","Park, Keunhyun","Choi, Dong-ah","Wang, Yiyang",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT,Public transportation,Outdoor recreation,Mobility justice,Environmental justice,Park access,,,,,,,AUG 2024,"Riding transit to parks in Utah: Motivations, constraints, negotiations, and policy recommendations"

For instance, peripheral districts in the Jakarta metropolitan area (JMA), such as Bogor, Depok, Tangerang and Bekasi, contribute to the high mobility rate within the metropolitan area. This article examines the extent of motorcycle-based ridehailing for commuting in the JMA and Bandung metropolitan areas (BMA). In particular, this study explores ridehailing users' characteristics-social, economic and spatial-and their proportion to the total commuter mobility in a metropolitan area. The study employed descriptive statistical models using commuter data in the JMA and BMA, respectively. Our results indicate that young and lower-income commuters are the dominant users of ridehailing services. As motorcycle taxi services are relatively cheaper and accessible, young and lower-income commuters, including informal workers, prefer ride-hailing services. The study also suggests the impact of the intensification of inter-peri-urban mobilities of post-suburbanisation on the increasing demand for ride-hailing. In this sense, the study proposes that the long-overdue strengthening of metropolitan-scale governance is urgently required. It is also crucial for metropolitan governments to issue appropriate inter-district public transportation policies and engage in development.","Aritenang, Adiwan Fahlan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION,Motorcycle-based ride-hailing,Metropolitan,Commuters,Sharing economy,Indonesia,,,,,,,2024,The crucial role of motorcycle-based ride-hailing among commuters: The case of Jakarta and Bandung metropolitan areas

As cities worldwide strive to promote sustainable and efficient transportation options, BSS offer a flexible, eco-friendly alternative that complements traditional public transport systems. These systems, however, are complex and influenced by a myriad of endogenous and exogenous factors. This complexity poses challenges in predicting BSS activity and optimizing its usage and effectiveness. This study delves into the dynamics of the BSS in Hamburg, Germany, focusing on system stability and activity prediction. We propose an interpretable attention-based Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model and compare its performance with the state-of-the-art Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The proposed TFT model outperforms the LSTM model with a 36.8% improvement in RMSE and overcomes current black-box models via interpretability. Via detailed analysis, key factors influencing bike-sharing activity, especially in terms of temporal and spatial contexts, are identified, examined, and evaluated. Based on the results, we propose interventions and a deployed TFT model that can improve the effectiveness of BSS.

Despite the popularity of escooters, increases in rider injuries and fatalities have become a public health concern. Objective. To characterize the types of safety issues associated with e-scooter use. Methods. Scoping review methods focused on any safety issues associated with the use of dockless, stand-up, motorized, electric kick scooters from companies offering short-term rentals or through private ownership, published in English between January 2017 and March 2022. Databases included Academic Search Complete, Business Source Complete, Google Scholar, PsychINFO, PubMed, Scopus, SocINDEX, TRID Database, and Web of Science databases. After abstract screening and full text review, a total of 81 studies were included in the scoping review. Results. Few e-scooter riders wear helmets except where legally required. Alcohol impairment is a primary contributor to escooter injuries. Younger males, underage riding, double riding, speeding and rider distraction were also identified as behavioural contributors to e-scooter injury crashes. Environmental contributors included crash locations (e.g., sidewalks, bike paths, roads) parking issues (e.g., tripping hazard), fixed object collisions (e.g., lampposts, parked cars), road surface and slope (e.g., uneven, curbs, downhills) and insufficient nighttime visibility. E-scooter reliability was affected by brake failures and design limitations (e.g., stability over rough terrain). Injury patterns included mechanism of injury (loss of balance and/or control, fall) and moving object collisions (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, bicyclists). The head, face, upper and lower extremities were the most common anatomical locations injured. Fractures, contusions, concussions, lacerations, and sprains were the most frequent injury types. Discussion. Policies, regulations and interventions that address helmet requirements, alcohol and drug use, rider skill and knowledge acquisition, restrictive speed limits, education and enforcement are discussed with respect to evidence-based safety guidance for transportation policy and decision makers. Conclusion. Behavioural, environmental and device design safety issues associated with e-scooter use require effective interventions to reduce the frequency and severity of rider injuries.","Janikian, Gabriela S.","Caird, Jeff K.","Hagel, Brent","Reay, Gudrun",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART F-TRAFFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR,Safety,Scoping review,Injuries,Risky behavior,Research synthesis,Micro-mobility,,,,,,FEB 2024,A scoping review of E-scooter safety: Delightful urban slalom or injury epidemic?

Row_271,"The restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic have led to significant changes in travel behaviour and public activities, and they might have contributed to changes in residential location choices. However, research examining the relationship between residential location choice and COVID-19 is very limited. To that end, this paper focuses on how pandemic-induced changes in work patterns, travel preferences and daily activity patterns have altered residential preferences and potentially, relocation trends. The main determinants of residential location choice have been established in the literature over the past 30 years: physical attributes of the dwelling; surrounding built environment; affordability; and accessibility to transportation, workplaces, and services. However, each of these determinants are prioritised differently depending on the circumstances. Therefore, exploring how these priorities have shifted after the pandemic can pave the way for understanding how preferences for residential location choice shift as a consequence. From the review, the key findings include the decreasing importance of transport and workplace accessibility in residential location choice after the pandemic. Firstly, teleworking is becoming more prevalent within office jobs than before the pandemic, leading to less frequent trips to conventional workplaces, reducing the need to live within a commutable distance to a workplace. Secondly, trips to other activities have likewise become less frequent due to either remote alternatives (e. g., online shopping) or shifting towards services closer to home, reducing the need to travel in general. Another consequence of the pandemic is people staying at home longer than before, thus increasing the need for more desirable dwelling attributes such as larger house size and wider surrounding green space. Since these attributes are generally more affordable in areas less accessible to transport and services, this may subsequently lead to migrations to areas of lower population density, potentially decentralising urban areas.","Ilham, Mostafa Ayman","Fonzone, Achille","Fountas, Grigorios","Mora, Luca",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,CITIES,Residential location choice,Urban decentralisation,Travel behaviour,Activity behaviour,COVID-19,Post -pandemic,Teleworking,,,,,AUG 2024,To move or not to move: A review of residential relocation trends after COVID-19

The shape of the resulting impedance decay curves varies by several factors, but these influential factors are often dismissed in favor of just travel mode. In this study, we examine which factors should be used to distinguish impedance functions for use. Using data from a large national travel survey, we first show that the impedance curves are well approximated by functions of the exponential family and the related Tanner function. We use two methods - variable-wise function fit and Shapley additive explanations - to conclude the importance of four factors for developing impedance functions. These are travel mode, trip purpose, urbanity class of trip origin and destination, and the socioeconomic status grouping of the travelers. We then show that the use of a generalized impedance function can significantly over- or underestimate spatial accessibility compared to factor-specific impedance function, with up to 80 % overestimation on average in the case of public transit and 16 % overestimation for low socio-economic status travelers. These findings highlight the importance of the choice of impedance function which has applications in spatial economics, transportation planning, and human mobility analyses.","Verma, Rajat","Ukkusuri, Satish V.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Distance decay,Spatial interaction,Accessibility,Travel behavior,Transport planning,Geography,,,,,,JAN 2025,What determines travel time and distance decay in spatial interaction and accessibility?

In this direction, this study seeks to understand the effects of the abovementioned factors on accessibility, with particular attention on leisure and work trips. This analysis is based on different combinations of least square regression models. In general, results show that the built environment has more effects on leisure accessibility, while work accessibility is conditioned to sociodemographic factors. Thus, results show that the city does not present an urban environment that delivers reliability for work trips, which is pressured by time and costs.

However, the availability of greenery along them likely varies among different socioeconomic status (SES) groups. If low-SES children have less exposure to greenery than others during these walks, this might represent environmental injustice in transportation. We assess socio-environmental inequalities regarding children's exposure to greenery in three alternative home-school routes: the shortest, simplest, and greenest. We used a mixed-method approach, linking viewshed analysis, space syntax and network analysis using multiple Lodz (Poland) datasets.

Row_283,"Affordable housing and transit accessibility have long been focal points for housing and urban development agencies at all levels, from national to regional. However, these elements are often considered and planned for independently, leading over time to an expanding spatial gap between affordable housing and transit services. This separation creates issues of mobility equity. Fortunately, bikeshare, an emerging mobility solution, provides the potential to bridge this spatial gap between affordable housing communities and transit services. To leverage this, we designed a bikeshare station (BSS) location optimization tool that aims to alleviate the impacts of this spatial divide through bikeshare services. Specifically, we developed a multimodal agent -based modeling (ABM) and simulation framework aimed at enhancing accessibility to a variety of destinations. To solve this optimization problem, we developed a genetic algorithm to determine the optimal locations for BSS. There are three main conclusions from this research. First, the strategic positioning of BSS will enhance accessibility for affordable housing community (AHC) residents by reducing average transit travel time and walk distance, or increasing the number of destinations accessible by transit. This underscores the advantages of combining bikeshare and transit systems to cater to the mobility requirements of AHC residents, especially for non -workrelated trips in suburban areas. Second, the relationship between transit and bikeshare is twofold: complementation and substitution. In instances where a lengthy trip involves multiple transit transfers and significant waiting time, bikeshare could replace some transit trips. Lastly, but most importantly, this study advises a forward -looking approach for governments and operators to avoid the waste of public resources when planning bikeshare systems. The tool developed by this research can facilitate this forward -looking approach in practice.","Qian, Xiaodong","Xiao, Runhua Ivan","Joby, Raina","Jaller, Miguel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Affordable housing communities,Bikeshare,Transit,Accessibility,Spatial optimization,,,,,,,MAY 2024,Optimizing bikeshare service to connect affordable housing units with transit service

This paper aims to comprehensively assess the impact of this lockdown. Traffic data for March and June of 2022 were collected, including the vehicular traffic volumes from four typical intersections and metro ridership. Other important indicators, including COVID-19 cases, Baidu Index and Shanghai Stock Exchange Index, were also employed. The results show that: (1) In both March and June, except for the intersection near the major hospital, the ratios between the weekday and weekend traffic volumes were higher than those observed before the pandemic, which implies a significant drop in leisure trips during these periods. (2) The evolution of traffic volume in March was largely driven by some important COVID-19-related events, while the traffic volume in June showed a more spontaneous and stepwise recovery pattern. (3) The confirmed cases had a significant impact on the traffic volume in March, but the time lag of the confirmed cases was not found. The impact of confirmed cases on traffic volume in June was not significant. (4) The transfer from public transport to private ones could be observed during this period, but the recovery proportion of Shanghai metro ridership is higher than most other cities examined in this study, suggesting the importance of enhancing public confidence for public transport in the post-pandemic period. These findings can aid in refining potential pandemic measures for future scenarios.","Jin, Cheng-Jie","Li, Jiaxin","Wu, Chenyang","Li, Dawei","Jiang, Rui",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,CASE STUDIES ON TRANSPORT POLICY,COVID-19,Lockdown,Post -pandemic,Travel behavior,Shanghai,,,,,,,SEP 2024,"The travel behaviors before and after lockdown: Case study on Shanghai, 2022"
Row_285,"In this paper we report insights on barriers to active travel among the Pakistani heritage community in Bradford UK, generated using the participatory Photovoice method. This is the largest minoritized ethnic group in Bradford, and though most segments of the UK population need to be more physically active, those of non-white ethnicities, and South Asian heritage in particular, are generally significantly less active than average. Insufficient physical activity (including active travel) contributes to a significant health burden for minoritized communities as well limiting progress with increasing active travel among these communities. Increasing active travel is known to contribute to both positive health outcomes and to key transport decarbonisation aims. To meet public health goals and Net Zero emissions targets by 2050, increasing walking and cycling for short journeys will be essential but it remains difficult to achieve. There is a lack of knowledge relating to how specific cultural groups perceive active travel as an option within their local areas. We sought to explore the use of Photovoice to understand whether this method has potential to enable minoritized communities to actively consider active travel, and to provide connections between these communities and their local authorities. We recruited eight Pakistani heritage families living in Bradford to do this. Their photos were used in semi-structured interviews, and the data collectively analysed. The analysis suggested key barriers to walking and cycling could be grouped into four main categories: personal factors, social factors and those related to the local and wider environment. We also found that people's travel choices in this study are influenced by cognitive biases and social norms that are quite connected to their cultural heritage and societal position as minoritized. There were also both generational and gendered effects that need to be accounted for in intervention design. Based on participants' reflection and feedback, this report concludes participatory techniques like Photovoice offer an opportunity to break the status quo for those who are struggling to make a change by raising their social consciousness and helping them to gather evidence of their concerns.","Batool, Zahara","Pangbourne, Kate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Active travel,Pakistani Pakistani heritage community,Photovoice,Behaviour change,Place -based decarbonisation,,,,,,,MAY 2024,"Visualising active travel with Pakistani heritage families in Bradford, UK - Photovoice as a tool for change"

For this reason, understanding how residents perceive the impacts of such schemes is critical to their evaluation. To this aim, this article assesses residents' perceptions and preferences regarding the pedestrianisation of multiple streets in the Eixample district of Barcelona in recent years, through a representative survey of the district's residents (n = 1211). Our research examines how residents' views on pedestrianisation vary depending on their mobility habits, sociodemographic background, and the level of traffic calming of the street they live on. Our results show that most respondents (66%) consider that the impacts of existing pedestrianisations have been positive regardless of whether they live on a pedestrianised street or not, even though residents of recently pedestrianised streets are more positive than those living on other streets. At the same time, many residents of pedestrianised streets consider that the benefits of reduced traffic externalities may be partially counterbalanced by new problems caused by an intensive use of public space (e.g. noise from people and cafes, touristification, nightlife). Our results also show that there is a strong relationship between support for pedestrianisation, age and mobility habits: daily car and motorbike users are much less supportive of pedestrianisation than public transport users and cyclists, while support for pedestrianisation decreases markedly with advancing age.","Nello-Deakin, Samuel","Vallve, Candela Sancho","Akinci, Zeynep Sila",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,HABITAT INTERNATIONAL,Pedestrianisation,Barcelona,Superblocks,Street transformation,Resident survey,,,,,,,AUG 2024,Who's afraid of pedestrianisation?

However, according to the author view and recent studies, there has been limited studies which shows the influence of daily activities on health parameters. Besides, activity participation is complex which don't influence health directly. Therefore, the current study aim to investigate the influence of daily time-use and activity travel participation (ATP) on health parameters using intensity of physical activity at leisure time as intermediate variable using multi-dimensional three-week household survey. 191 houses and 732 persons in all were counted, which corresponds to 0.029% of the BMA's entire population. The association between activity patterns and health factors is validated using the hierarchical Structural Equation Model (SEM). According to the projected results, a minute increase in public transport mode makes a 0.088 positive correlation with physical health and 0.090 with social health, whereas the total travel time of 0.05 negatively affects physical health. Additionally, there is a strong correlation between improved physical and social health and the accessibility and availability of essential facilities within walking distance.

Using partial least squares structural equation modeling, we model user acceptance pre- and post-VR experience and compare the change in influencing factors. Results show that, under the conditions we defined, the intention to use autonomous shuttles was influenced by the virtual reality experience, as there was an increase in the behavioral intention and a change in the significant predictors. Overall, we found evidence that the virtual reality experience did influence the acceptance of autonomous vehicles, and can then be an effective test bed to visualize future impacts of autonomous vehicles that are impossible to project in real life.

Row_289,"With the advancement in autonomous driving techniques, autonomous demand- responsive transit (ADRT) is a newly emerging sustainable transport mode for the future, which will provide more flexible services to public users. ADRT offers benefits such as flexible stops and routes and comfortable seats, but it also involves risks due to the vehicles being driverless. This paper particularly investigates users' preferences and attitudes towards ADRT, and mode choice behavior between ADRT buses and traditional buses. A survey with Likert scale statements and stated preference (SP) choice scenarios is designed and conducted to explore users' attitudes towards the safety risks of autonomous vehicles (AVs), social concerns, service flexibility concerns when using AVs, interest in new things, and shuttle mode choices. An integrated choice and latent variable (ICLV) model is adopted to explore users' psychological factors through latent variables and to integrate them into mode choice behavioral modeling. Estimated results indicate that users' attitudes towards AV safety risks, their social concerns, and their flexibility concerns with ADRT strongly influence their mode choices and are strongly related to sociodemographic and travel- related factors such as age, gender, income, education, number of family members. In general, a young age, a high education level, a higher income, private car ownership, and better knowledge of AVs are positively related to attitudes towards ADRT. Females, users from large families, and users with driving licenses or long commuting times are less willing to adopt ADRT. The study's outcomes highlight significant heterogeneities among users and can be highly valuable for policymakers, such as government authorities, in providing social support and designing policies targeting specific population groups. This will be beneficial in attracting more users to this emerging mobility service and contributing to sustainable urban development. (c) 2024 Tongji University and Tongji University Press.

This study focuses on a novel battery electric bus (BEB) charging scheduling problem involving solar photovoltaic (PV) and battery energy storage facilities. A mixed integer linear programming model is formulated to schedule BEB charging and control solar PV energy simultaneously. The model handles a range of realistic considerations, including heterogeneous BEBs regarding battery capacities, peak net charging power costs, flexible charging powers, and multi-route-multi-depot scheduling. A key point of our model is the introduction of variable charging power decisions designed to align BEB charging demands with solar PV production. The optimization objective is to minimize the sum of charging costs, carbon emission costs, energy storage costs, and revenue (negative cost) from solar PV energy sales. The model empowers public transport agencies to swiftly generate daily BEB charging schedules given daily solar and weather variations. A case study is performed in Beijing, China, utilizing actual bus trajectory data, weather conditions, solar irradiance, and detailed built environment data of bus depots. The results show that the proposed model can significantly reduce the operating cost and shift the charging loads by improving solar PV energy utilization.","Liu, Xiaohan","Yeh, Sonia","Ploetz, Patrick","Ma, Wenxi","Li, Feng","Ma, Xiaolei",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART E-LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION REVIEW,Bus charging scheduling,Solar photovoltaic energy,Peak net charging power,Mixed integer linear program,Carbon emissions,,,,,,,JUL 2024,Electric bus charging scheduling problem considering charging infrastructure integrated with solar photovoltaic and energy storage systems

Row_292,"The proliferation of emerging mobility technology has led to a significant increase in demand for ride-hailing services, on-demand deliveries, and micromobility services, transforming curb spaces into valuable public infrastructure for which multimodal transportation competes. However, the increasing utilization of curbs by different traffic modes has substantial societal impacts, further altering travelers' choices and polluting the urban environment. Integrating the spatiotemporal characteristics of various behaviors related to curb utilization into general dynamic networks and exploring mobility patterns with multisource data remain a challenge. To address this issue, this study proposes a comprehensive framework of modeling curbside usage by multimodal transportation in a general dynamic network. The framework encapsulates route choices, curb space competition, and interactive effects among different curb users, and it embeds the dynamics of curb usage into a mesoscopic dynamic network model. Furthermore, a curb-aware dynamic origin-destination demand estimation framework is proposed to reveal the network-level spatiotemporal mobility patterns associated with curb usage through a physics-informed data-driven approach. The framework integrates emerging real-world curb use data in conjunction with other mobility data represented on computational graphs, which can be solved efficiently using the forward-backward algorithm on large-scale networks. The framework is examined on a small network as well as a large-scale real-world network. The estimation results on both networks are satisfactory and compelling, demonstrating the capability of the framework to estimate the spatiotemporal curb usage by multimodal transportation.","Liu, Jiachao","Qian, Sean",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE,dynamic traffic assignment,curbside management,mesoscopic traffic simulation,dynamic origin-destination demand estimation,computational graph,,,,,,,NOV-DEC 2024,Modeling Multimodal Curbside Usage in Dynamic Networks

Besides internal-city CPV travellers, travellers with external trips (either origins or destinations are outside the city) are also shifted to SAVs or Public Transit (PT) based on individuals' utilities with Park-and-Ride (PnR) initiatives. Our research presents a new PnR allocation approach optimising PnR facilities selections. Then, several Agent-Based Modellings (ABM) are conducted using MATSim. Brussels, the capital of Belgium, is selected as the case study area. The outcomes reveal the significant impacts of PnR market penetration and SAV pricing strategies. The proposed carfree initiatives bring notable benefits, including reduced congestion in the city centre and significant transport emission reductions. However, there are also drawbacks, such as longer travel time for PnR travellers and increased congestion in specific regions. Consequently, a PnR market penetration between 40% to 60% represents a feasible range under the current Brussels mobility network. Furthermore, SAVs should be seen as a complement to PT rather than with a very low fare structure. Generally, our findings emphasise the necessity for a multifaceted approach for different stakeholders to maximise SAV benefits towards more sustainable mobility networks.","Li, Jingjun","Rombaut, Evy","Vanhaverbeke, Lieselot",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS,Shared autonomous vehicle,Park -and -ride,Carfree City,External Travellers,Agent -based simulation,,,,,,,SEP 2024,How far are we towards sustainable Carfree cities combining shared autonomous vehicles with park-and-ride: An agent-based simulation assessment for Brussels
Row_294,"Canadian cities have made significant investments in cycling infrastructure to support uptake in active transportation. Who has spatial access to supportive infrastructure is an important equity question: lack of access to safe infrastructure for cycling may limit who has an option to use a bicycle to meet their transportation needs (to access employment, educational, social, or other essential services) as well as who may achieve the physical and mental health benefits possible through physical activity. Our aim is to measure spatial access to cycling infrastructure in Canadian cities, and to provide a broad, national understanding of inequitable access to cycling infrastructure for equity-deserving populations (children, seniors, recent immigrants, visible minorities, and people with low incomes). Accordingly, we used a national dataset of cycling infrastructure (Can-BICS), which summarizes the quantity of cycling infrastructure for all dissemination areas in Canada, and 2016 Census data to estimate associations between area-level sociodemographic characteristics and access to cycling infrastructure. In unadjusted associations, equity-deserving groups (i.e., recent immigrants and people with low incomes) had better access to cycling infrastructure. Pearson coefficients highlighted variations in the equity of cycling infrastructure across cities. Overall, access was more equitable across equity-deserving groups in large cities, compared to mid-sized and small cities. After adjusting for covariates related to urban form and mode share, access to cycling infrastructure was higher in areas with more seniors, more recent immigrants, more visible minorities, and more people with low incomes, but lower in areas with more children. More importantly, there are still a substantial number of people from equity-deserving groups living in areas with very low levels of cycling infrastructure. For example, similar to 1.5 million children under the age of 14 (31% of children), 1.5 million older adults (31%), 1.4 million visible minorities, and 0.5 million people with low income (20%) live in dissemination areas with the lowest level of cycling infrastructure. These results highlight the need to understand which populations stand to gain by cycling infrastructure investments and which populations are being left behind.

Row_295,"Transportation economics studies show that the activity density, in particular, employment density, is influenced by availability and quality of transportation infrastructure and services, including public transit. These studies also show that businesses and economic activities may have unique requirements, preferences, and characteristics, which may lead to varying effect of transportation on different sectors. However, the relationship between transit infrastructure and employment density has been examined mostly using simple transit proximity distance or travel time in the past research and few have used transit accessibility, and none have accounted for first/last mile (FMLM) modality, different public transit service type, and job matching mechanisms. This study attempts to fill these gaps by utilizing a new accessibility measure that is adaptive to the aforesaid features and comparing its relationship with employment density across various industries. The results show a positive and significant relationship between employment density and bus service accessibility for all industrial sectors, while the effect of light rail service is significant only for finance, real estate, insurance, food, and accommodation industrial sectors, and when FMLM modality is driving. Proximity to public transit was found to be a stronger predictor of job density than accessibility. Additionally, the effect of closeness to highway network was almost twice the effect of transit proximity for all sectors, especially for blue-collar jobs. The results also highlight that industrial sectors tend to cluster in areas with higher employment diversity but are indifferent towards higher land use diversity. These results signify several challenges in transportation equity and multimodal planning and policies. Improving regional public transit integration through coordinated physical infrastructure, fare systems, and schedules, along with enhancing walking amenities in key areas, could improve connectivity between activities.

However, little attention has been given to how TOD projects are associated with socioeconomic and spatial inequalities and its effects on people's access to economic activities and public services, particularly in the Global South. In this paper we analyze how socio-spatial inequalities have been shaped by transport and land-use planning in Curitiba (Brazil), a city internationally recognized for its TOD planning based on Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). We examine how the spatial organization of the BRT system is associated with the distribution of population densities, socioeconomic groups, and real-estate values and its implications in terms of inequalities of access to employment opportunities and health services. The results show that Curitiba's TOD has had limited influence on population densities, but contributed for the unequal distribution of its benefits, privileging high-income classes and premium real-estate along its main BRT corridors. These effects contribute to push low-income communities to peripheral urban areas with limited accessibility benefits from the transit system. Our findings suggest that Curitiba's success story should be seen as a cautionary tale about the consequences of TOD planning, which perpetuate the spatial concentration of resources and reinforce inequalities of access to opportunities. The broader lesson of this study is that TOD planning must be constantly evaluated by its socials and environmental impacts, and be guided by mixed housing, and social inclusion to avoid potential consequences in terms of segregation and peripheralization of poorer communities.","Turbay, Andre L.

To assess the impact of waiting time, the model compares an acceptable waiting time (5 min) with the average waiting time of the service. A threshold walking time of 8 min defines the service coverage area. Results indicate that the collective fixed-route service covers only 39.49% of the city's urban area.

However, numerous studies on RHS's impact on private modes' usage provide inconclusive evidence. Notably, few studies have analyzed RHS's impacts on modal changes in the context of motorcycle-based societies. This study attempts to identify the critical factors affecting RHS users' private mode usage (private cars and motorcycles) in response to RHS appearance in Hanoi, Vietnam, a motorcycle-based society. Two empirical analyses were performed with sample data of 642 individuals collected from face-to-face interviews using paperbased questionnaire sheets in Hanoi from December 19 to 21, 2020. The first analysis employed a linear regression model to explain the changes in individuals' private mode usage before and after RHS adoption. The second analysis estimated a logistic regression model to examine an individual's private mode choice when RHS are unavailable. Robustness tests were also performed. The results revealed that RHS users' future vehicle ownership intentions, reasons for using RHS instead of private modes, motorcycle ownership, and public transport usage significantly reduce the impacts of RHS on private mode usage. The reasons for using RHS rather than private modes were found not strong enough to make an essential change to reduce the frequency of private modes usage. The results also showed there is a difference between the RHS's impacts on motorcycle use and car use. They suggested that policy makers should be aware of the unique factors in motorcycle-based societies such as Hanoi when formulating urban transportation strategies. Finally, the findings further supported an idea that multivariate analyses are more suitable than the simple descriptive statistics method to understand how the motivation for using RHS influences the impacts of RHS on private mode usage.","Hoang-Tung, Nguyen","Kato, Hironori","Linh, Hoang Thuy","Cuong, Hoang Van","Binh, Phan Le","Takeda, Shinichi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH INTERDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVES,ride-hailing service,private mode,motorcycle-based society,modal choice,,,,,,,,MAR 2024,Ride-hailing service availability and private transportation mode usage in a motorcycle-based city: Evidence from Hanoi

Taking 366 cities in China as an example, this study proposed a novel research framework for analyzing the spatiotemporal characteristics of intercity population flows. Using AutoNavi population migration big data sets from web crawling, the spatiotemporal structure patterns of intercity travel in China from January 1st to June 30th, 2020 were extracted by using the singular value decomposition (SVD) method. Then the spatial organization patterns of intercity travel networks in China and its five major urban agglomerations were identified by the weighted stochastic block model (WSBM). The results showed that the total volume of intercity travel in China and its five major urban agglomerations experienced a process of rapid decline followed by a slow recovery, presenting a ""Vshaped"" distribution since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Three distinctive intercity travel patterns, namely the stable, holiday, and weekday-weekend intercity trip patterns, were extracted from the spatiotemporal OD matrix of intercity travel. Strong intercity travels were mainly distributed in eastern and central China, forming an intercity travel pattern in which core cities pushed and pulled each other within the national urban agglomerations. However, intercity migration flows were dominated by weak-intensity flows. Intercity trips during the holidays had a phenomenon of ""escaping from the metropolis"". Meanwhile, it had significant spatial proximity and directionality. The daily intercity trips were characterized by a remarkable periodicity with seven days as a repeat. A more interesting finding is that when weekends overlap with holidays, intercity travel on the 1-2 days before the vacations has presented an effect of ""suppression travel"". Furthermore, at the national scale, the stable intercity travel network has formed a polycentric core-periphery structure of ""Three Cores-Six Semiperipheries-Five Peripheries"". At the urban agglomeration scale, they formed respectively distinguished monocentric, bicentric, and polycentric core-periphery structures.","Wei, Shimei","Pan, Jinghu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,CITIES,Intercity travel,Spatiotemporal pattern,Singular value decomposition (SVD),Weighted stochastic block model (WSBM),COVID-19,AutoNavi migration index (AMI),China,,,,,SEP 2024,Spatiotemporal characteristics of residents' intercity travel in China under the impact of COVID-19 pandemic

Drawing on 917 Scopus-indexed articles and 23 stakeholder interviews, it explores economic, environmental, energy, and social (EEES) dynamics through the Theory-Context-Methodology (TCM) framework and causal loop diagrams. Findings reveal dominant theories, such as the Theory of Planned Behavior and Value-Belief Norm Theory, and underscore the importance of methodological approaches like regression analysis and structural equation modeling. Key research themes include adoption intention, green infrastructure, and sustainable transport policy, all aligning with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 7 (Clean Energy), 11 (Sustainable Cities), and 13 (Climate Action). By constructing a causal loop diagram, this study illustrates complex interrelations among EEES factors, highlighting the reinforcing and balancing influences on EV adoption behavior. The proposed integrated framework provides a roadmap for future research, identifying significant gaps and strategic directions for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and researchers. Practical implications include guidelines to foster EV integration into smart cities, addressing infrastructure and environmental challenges while encouraging policy incentives to enhance public adoption. The study's theoretical implications include the expansion of existing behavioral theories, the development of an integrated theoretical framework that combines TCM and CLDs, the introduction of CLDs as a tool for complex systems analysis, and the identification of thematic clusters within EV adoption research.

Using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) methodology, a thorough analysis of relevant studies was conducted to identify key factors influencing VMS impact, including message content and characteristics, complementary sources of information, user demographics, VMS location, and users' reliance on these signs. Additionally, the review explores the implications of displaying non-critical information on VMS and introduces virtual dynamic message signs (VDMSs) as an innovative approach for delivering public traveler information. The study identifies several research gaps, such as the integration of VMS with vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies, navigation systems, the need for validation in real-world scenarios, and understanding behavioral responses to non-critical information on VMS. This review highlights the importance of optimizing VMS for improved user engagement and traffic management, providing valuable insights and directions for future research in this evolving field.","Lagoa, Paula","Galvao, Teresa","Ferreira, Marta Campos",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,INFRASTRUCTURES,variable message signs (VMSs),human-computer interaction (HCI),user behavior,,,,,,,,,OCT 2024,Variable Message Signs in Traffic Management: A Systematic Review of User Behavior and Future Innovations

These conditions are common situations in many contexts of our countrybut are intensified where spatial inequality and environmental vulnerability converge. Although declined in different territoriesthese situationshave at their center the complex space of the road. The road system not only contributes significantly to climate change but is also the main victim of the consequences related to these changes. The research investigates the role of the roads and parking spaces,interpretedas the main background of our everydaylives, in facilitating socio-ecological transition of most fragile territories. Particular attention is paid to the different vulnerabilities of Italian coastline and to the ways in which adaptation measures can be implemented to mitigate risks. The initial analyses are focused on developing methods to measure and evaluate the climatic, geophysical, and socio-economic vulnerabilities of coastal roads, which are rendered, through aggregated maps of quantitative and qualitative indicators, in an ""Atlas of Coastal Roads"".

Row_304,"As the driving range of electric vehicles (EVs) increases, home-based charging has been becoming the dominant strategy for EV users to replenish electricity in urban e-mobility systems. In Asian metropolises with high population density (called dense-cities), the majority of residents live in multi-unit dwellings and share public parking and charging facilities in their residential carparks. This study, therefore, investigates the EV charging facility deployment (CFD) problem for dense-city residential carparks, taking into account charging demand uncertainty and the impact of grid dynamics. To address this problem, we first develop a water-pipe model to minimize the construction cost of the CFD scheme while balancing dynamic charging demand and supply. We then extend our approach to formulate a chance-constraint optimization model that considers more practical factors such as stochastic and dynamic charging demand, multi- type chargers, grid dynamics and the setup time of charging service. Furthermore, we propose a simulation-based method to validate the developed CFD models at the operational level. Our case study in Singapore demonstrates that the chance-constraint optimization model produces effective CFD solutions for all simulated charging scenarios. Our results also reveal the importance of considering grid dynamics and charging demand uncertainty for the residential-carpark CFD problem.","Wang, Hua","Meng, Qiang","Xiao, Ling",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES,Electric vehicle,Charging facility deployment,Water-pipe model,Chance-constraint optimization model,Grid dynamics,Charging demand uncertainty,,,,,,NOV 2024,Electric-vehicle charging facility deployment models for dense-city residential carparks considering demand uncertainty and grid dynamics
Row_305,"The success of future, on-demand AVs depends on whether and how the public adopts them as regular travel modes. To this end, this study has four objectives: (a) understand the effect of current travel behavior on adopting shared automated vehicles (SAVs) and pooled automated vehicles (PooledAVs), and accordingly, propose a theoretical model for behavioral intention to use on-demand AVs based on a mediation analysis; (b) identify the commonalities and differences between the characteristics of SAVs' and PooledAVs' early adopters; (c) investigate Canadian residents' intentions to adopt on-demand AVs; and (d) differentiate between shared mobility-oriented and AV technology-oriented predictors to determine whether behavioral intentions are driven by enthusiasm for AV technology or linked to shared mobility. This study uses data from an online survey administered in fall 2021 to residents of six major Canadian metropolitan areas. Workers and students aged 18 to 75 were selected for analysis (n = 3622). The study employs a full structural equation model (SEM) and a partial mediation analysis. The SEM uses seven affective motivations: attitude towards a behavior, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, driving enthusiasm, sensation seeking, ample knowledge about AVs, and ecofriendliness. The findings of this paper paint a complex picture with respect to the application of constructs from common technology adoption models to the study of on-demand AVs. Also, results suggest that although the characteristics of early adopters differ slightly among the examined service types, individuals with positive attitudes who are current users of ride-hailing services are likely to use both on-demand service types.","Hamiditehrani, Samira","Scott, Darren M.","Sweet, Matthias N.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,TRAVEL BEHAVIOUR AND SOCIETY,Automated vehicle,Canada,Pooled automated vehicle,Shared automated vehicle,Theory of planned behavior,,,,,,,JUL 2024,Shared versus pooled automated vehicles: Understanding behavioral intentions towards adopting on-demand automated vehicles
Row_306,"While data plays an important role in transportation research, sampled data is not always reliable. Data reliability issue is significant especially for minority groups. In this study, a districting approach is proposed which improves data reliability through aggregation of basic spatial units (BSU), adapted from a max-p-regions problem. The model generates as many aggregated zones as possible that minimize intrazonal heterogeneity while minimizing data margin of error (MOE) of all aggregated zones using a controlling MOE threshold. The problem is first formulated as an integer programming which selects optimal set of zones from a pre-generated set of candidate zones. The difficulty of solving the formulation lies in the generation of the candidate set, so a heuristic solution algorithm is proposed. Two case studies are provided to illustrate the method and validate its performance by evaluating the resulting data quality in an example subsequent planning model. First is an area in Downtown Manhattan with 62 census tracts, comparing the aggregated zones with Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTAs) and Taxi Zones. Second is the generation of the New York City Equitable Zoning (NYCEZ), which generated 574 Equitable Zones that reduce the average MOE% of demographic data by 48% for seniors, 75% for lowincome population, and 46% for long commuters, all with a district number that is higher than NTAs (221) and Taxi Zones (263). NYCEZ and census tracts are then compared in a subsequent model, synthetic population generation, showing an improvement of 6.2% in standard deviation across simulated populations under the proposed zone design. NYCEZ showed smaller variation in the generated population data. The algorithm can help the decision making of public agencies and the service design of mobility providers by producing reliable and equitable data. The algorithm can also be applied to data-sharing between mobility providers and agencies to alleviate privacy concerns.","Liu, Bingqing","Namdarpour, Farnoosh","Chow, Joseph Y.

Row_307,"Objective: Transportation systems are a basis of disability-related activity involvement in society. In Tehran, the capital of Iran, a paratransit system for disabled people has been operating since 2013, but the market share is gradually losing for reasons unknown to practitioners. Although paratransit systems for people with disabilities exist in many cities, no comprehensive study has been completed to identify attitudinal and contextual barriers to the continuance intention to use the system, particularly in a low-income developing country. Thus, due to limitations faced by qualified experts in this field, the adoption of efficient transportation policy and engineering interventions is still limited. Methods and analysis: The Technology Continuance Theory (TCT) is employed in this study as a structural equation modeling framework to analyze and quantify relationships based on the data gathered by face-to-face interviews. The mediation/moderation analyses in this paper reveal that (i) stress, (ii) self-efficacy, (ii) social isolation, (iv) mode captivity, (v) experience of usage, and (vi) type of disability are of prime importance in disabled people's intention to reuse the paratransit system. Main findings: Stress is examined through serial mediation analysis. The analysis reveals that stress due to the system's uncertain attributes significantly influences satisfaction. Self-efficacy and social isolation are presented for the moderation and moderated-mediation analyses. It is found that the urban mobility performance of the system is of more importance to disabled people with lower self-efficacy (high social isolation); however, their stress is not significantly reduced even by increasing the usefulness of the system. The mode captivity is also redefined in this context and entered as a moderator. It is found that, for captive riders, satisfaction does not have a dominating role in the intention to use the paratransit system, as the users are constrained by taking what is available or nothing. The usage experience is another moderator, and our analysis shows that attitude is a determinant of behavior for long-term users, while satisfaction with a transient effect is a dominating factor for short-term ones. Finally, the users are categorized by type of disability, and the moderation analysis shows that for people with physical disabilities, the system's performance is the most influential factor in their satisfaction, while for people with sensory disabilities, other factors related to amenity, safety, and support are also prominent. Implications: This paper ultimately presents explicit and thorough policy considerations and practical implications. The article's concluding remark will comprise a disclosure of previously undisclosed insights that underlie the study's findings.","Ekramifard, Ali","Khademi, Navid","Chaiyasarn, Krisada","Zheng, Zuduo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transportation for disabled people,Practical implications,Technology continuance theory (TCT),Mode captivity,Continuance intention,Structural equation modeling,,,,,,JUL 2024,Disability-specific factors in paratransit system continuance: Implications for transportation policy and practice in low-income developing countries
Row_308,"Transit users' lifecycle behavior pattern transition reflects the continuous and multi-phase changes in how frequently and regularly users utilize public transit over their lifetime. Predicting transit users' lifecycle behavior pattern transition is vital for enhancing the efficiency and responsiveness of transportation systems. Thus, this study incorporates lifecycle analysis in predicting long-term sequential behavioral pattern transition processes to go beyond just examining user churning at a single point in time. Specifically, this study proposes the TripChain2RecDeepSurv, a novel model that pioneers the individual-level analysis of lifecycle behavior status transitions (LBST) within public transit systems. The TripChain2RecDeepSurv is composed of (1) the TripChain2Vec module for encoding transit users' trip chains; (2) the self-attention Transformer module for exploring the latent features related to spatiotemporal patterns; (3) the recurrent deep survival analysis module for predicting LBSTs. We demonstrate TripChain2RecDeepSurv's predictive performance for empirical analysis by employing Shenzhen Bus data. Our model achieves a 74.39% accuracy rate in churn determination and over 80% accuracy in status sequence identification on the churn path. In addition, our findings highlight the segmented nature of Kaplan-Meier curves and identify the optimal intervention time against the user churning process. Meanwhile, the proposed model provides individual-level heterogeneity analysis, which emphasizes the significance of customizing user engagement strategies, advocating for interventions that extend users' engagement in patterns with high-frequency transit usage to curb the transition to less frequent travel usage.","Yu, Chengcheng","Lin, Haocheng","Dong, Wentao","Fang, Shen","Yang, Chao","Yuan, Quan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES,Transportation demand management,User retention,Survival analysis,Lifecycle behavior,TripChain2RecDeepSurv,,,,,,,OCT 2024,TripChain2RecDeepSurv: A novel framework to predict transit users' lifecycle behavior status transitions for user management☆
Row_309,"While the relationship between built environment, mobility choices and travel productions has been well documented, the impact of built environment on traffic performance, particularly congestion, is not extensively investigated. In existing investigations, the mechanisms by which built environment affects traffic performance-whether direct or indirect-remain unclear. Furthermore, traffic performance is mostly quantified by aggregated and rough performance metrics that fail to capture the operational characteristics of traffic. This study examines both the direct and indirect relationships between built environment and traffic congestion using the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) to connect traffic dynamics with built environment properties. The study hypothesizes that built environment has an indirect impact on congestion and analyzes the possible indirect effects utilizing the bootstrap mediation analysis. Two components, namely the ""operational capacity"" and ""travel demand"", are defined as mediating factors. The analysis is conducted based on data collected from 133 Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) in the Melbourne region, Australia, including both traffic and built environment data collected from 2019. Results show that ""road network connectivity"" and ""road network structure"" can intensify congestion, while ""public transit accessibility"" is critical in congestion reduction. The analysis also reveals that ""operational capacity"" serves as a mediating factor in this relationship. Notably, this analysis identifies less pronounced mediating effects, hinting that built environment may exert a more direct influence on congestion levels. The proposed analytical method and observations hold practical value for planners and policymakers in developing strategies for planning and infrastructure development. A critical takeaway is the imperative to assess the impact on the consequent operational traffic efficiency to ensure that potential congestion is proactively mitigated through informed and sustainable planning decisions.","Xiao, Dong","Kim, Inhi","Zheng, Nan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,Built environment,Traffic congestion,Macroscopic fundamental diagram,Mediating effect analysis,,,,,,,,DEC 2024,Does built environment have impact on traffic congestion? - A bootstrap mediation analysis on a case study of Melbourne
Row_310,"Based on the analysis of one-week GPS-based travel diary data from the four largest metropolitan areas in California, this study performs a latent-class cluster analysis and identifies four distinctive traveler groups with varying levels of multimodality. These groups are characterized by their distinctive use of five travel modes (i.e., single-occupant vehicles, carpooling, public transit, biking, and walking) for both work and non-work trips. Two of these groups are more car-oriented and less multimodal (i.e., drive-alone users and carpoolers), whereas the other two are less car-oriented and display higher levels of multimodality (i.e., transit users and cyclists). Results from this study reveal the unique profiles of each traveler group in terms of their sociodemographic characteristics and built-environment attributes. The study further investigates the different characteristics of each traveler group in relation to ridehailing adoption, trip frequency and trip attributes. Transit users are found to have the highest rate of ridehailing adoption and usage. They are also more prone to use pooled ridehailing services in comparison to other groups. In terms of mode substitution, if ridehailing were not available, respondents tend to choose the mode they use most frequently. In other words, car-based travelers are more likely to substitute ridehailing trips with car trips, whereas non-car-based travelers are more likely to replace ridehailing with less-polluting modes. The findings from this study will prove valuable for transit agencies and policymakers interested in integrating ridehailing with other modes and promoting more multimodal and less car-dependent lifestyles.","Iogansen, Xiatian","Lee, Yongsung","Young, Mischa","Compostella, Junia","Circella, Giovanni","Jenn, Alan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,TRAVEL BEHAVIOUR AND SOCIETY,Travel modality,Ridehailing,Latent-class cluster analysis,Mode substitution,,,,,,,,JAN 2025,"Ridehailing use, travel patterns and multimodality: A latent-class cluster analysis of one-week GPS-based travel diaries in California"
Row_311,"Transportation is vital to life in society; it enables economic, social, and environmental development through connections between areas, cities, and countries, facilitating interactions and integrations. However, transportation is one of the sectors that most impacts sustainability, causing, among other things, emissions of gases, noise, and accidents. Through an integrative bibliographic framework, this study aims to assess the indicators used to evaluate the sustainability of land transportation in various contexts. To this end, relevant papers were selected with intuition to present their main characteristics, and through correlations between the variables analyzed, a framework was built indicating the current situation and future perspectives of the study. In terms of results, some common points were identified among papers, and some categories were pointed out as priorities for a future research agenda, such as the lack of standardization of indicators regarding metrics and nomenclature to emphasize sustainability. A lack of studies covering sustainability as a whole was found, which limits the results of sustainability assessments by only focusing on classic indicators and their deficiencies in relation to social inclusion, political-legal issues, and civil and human rights, as well as the standardization of indicators in other specific sectors.","Goulart, Jose Hugo de Souza","Fidelis, Reginaldo","De Andrade Junior, Pedro Paulo","Horst, Diogo Jose","Marco-Ferreira, Antonio",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,SUSTAINABILITY,analysis tools,coding and classification,integrative literature review,sustainability indicator assessment,transportation evaluation,,,,,,,JAN 2024,Sustainability Assessment Indicators in Land Transportation
