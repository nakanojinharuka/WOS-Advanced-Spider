Therefore, the diffusion process needs to be constrained to produce a segmentation mask that matches the target image. To address this issue, the denoising process is conditioned by utilizing the input image as a reference.

While extensively explored in the computer vision community, these techniques are primarily designed for natural images, resulting in limited generalization to remote sensing images. In contrast to the mostly individual and distinct objects presented in natural images, remote sensing images often feature clustered and regular patterns of objects. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach for few-shot remote sensing image semantic segmentation, which takes into account the specific characteristics of remote sensing imagery. Our approach introduces a mask classification pipeline, which initially extracts all independent objects within an image and subsequently assigns specific categories to each object guided by semantic information derived from few support images.

Although there has been tremendous success in such segmentation with the development of deep learning in the field, several limitations still exist in the current encoder-decoder models. First, the potential interdependencies of the context contained in each layer of the encoder-decoder architecture are not well utilized. Second, multi-scale features are insufficiently used, because the upper-layer and lower-layer features are not directly connected in the decoder part. In order to solve those limitations, a global attention gate (GAG) module is proposed to fully utilize the interdependencies of the context and multi-scale features, and then a global multi-attention UResNeXt (GMAUResNeXt) module is presented for the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images.

These deep segmentation methods are susceptible to adversarial attacks, while most of the existing attack methods tend to manipulate the image globally, leading to noticeable perturbations and chaotic segmentation. In this work, we propose a novel stealthy attack for semantic segmentation (SASS), which can largely increase the effectiveness and stealthiness from the existing attack methods on remote sensing images. SASS manipulates specific victim classes or objects of interest while preserving the original segmentation results for other classes or objects. In practice, as different inference mechanisms, overlapped inference, can be applied in segmentation, the efficacy of SASS may be degraded. To this end, we further introduce the masked SASS (MSASS), which generates augmented adversarial perturbations that only affect victim areas. We evaluate the effectiveness of SASS and MSASS using four state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models on the Vaihingen and Zurich Summer datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SASS and MSASS methods achieve superior attack performances on victim areas while maintaining high accuracies of other areas (drop less than 2%).

Second, long-range dependencies of feature maps are insufficiently explored, resulting in suboptimal feature representations associated with each semantic class.

Recently, self-supervised methods have tried to avoid the issue of great dependency on labeled datasets.

Random masks cannot drive the model focus on the salient information of the image, thus the learned features are not representative.

Specifically, HSDN first represents each pixel by calculating the pixel-level affinity as a high-order feature and then clusters these pixels into different semantics. Afterward, an attention-like mask generation module is designed for both intra-semantic and inter-semantic groups, leading to three kinds of masks, including the semantic decoupling mask (SDM), which utilizes each high-order cluster centroid as a mask to compact features intracluster and expand different interclusters, so as to improve semantic disentangle performance to a better extent; semantic enhancement mask (SEM), which records pixel-level relative correlation within a class to sufficiently exploit high-order features and could enhance feature robustness; and boundary supplementary mask (BSM), which aims to process borderline pixels to reduce cluster errors. Finally, by applying masks on pixels both within classes and on borderlines, semantic decoupled features are generated and concatenated to realize segmentation.

Recently, multimodal fusion-based segmentation models have attracted much attention due to their outstanding performance as compared to conventional single-modal techniques. However, most of these models perform their fusion operation using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or the vision transformer (Vit), resulting in insufficient local-global contextual modeling and representative capabilities. In this work, a multilevel multimodal fusion scheme called FTransUNet is proposed to provide a robust and effective multimodal fusion backbone for semantic segmentation by integrating both CNN and Vit into one unified fusion framework. First, the shallow-level features are first extracted and fused through convolutional layers and shallow-level feature fusion (SFF) modules. After that, deep-level features characterizing semantic information and spatial relationships are extracted and fused by a well-designed fusion Vit (FVit). It applies adaptively mutually boosted attention (Ada-MBA) layers and self-attention (SA) layers alternately in a three-stage scheme to learn cross-modality representations of high interclass separability and low intraclass variations. Specifically, the proposed Ada-MBA computes SA and cross-attention (CA) in parallel to enhance intra- and cross-modality contextual information simultaneously while steering attention distribution toward semantic-aware regions. As a result, FTransUNet can fuse shallow-level and deep-level features in a multilevel manner, taking full advantage of CNN and transformer to accurately characterize local details and global semantics, respectively.

Furthermore, the ranking weighting module tries to adaptively weight each pseudo-label of the unlabeled data according to its relative confidence ranking in its pseudo-class to alleviate model bias to majority classes as a result of the long-tailed distribution.

To address this problem, a novel self-supervised semantic segmentation framework is proposed for remote sensing imageries with limited labeled data. Specifically, image inpainting is acted as pixel-level pretext task for learning dense feature representations suitable for semantic segmentation. Furthermore, rather than trivially leveraging the conventional random inpainting strategy, a novel adversarial training scheme is proposed to drive the pretext task to adaptively mask and restore salient local regions. The adversarial training scheme consists of instructor network and inpainting network, the instructor network increasingly predicts meaningful salient regions as erased regions, and meanwhile the inpainting network seeks for restoring the corrupted image as pretext task to learn its intrinsic representation.

Achieving precise pixel-level classification is paramount for obtaining exceptional segmentation results. This challenge becomes even more complex due to the need to address intricate segmentation boundaries and accurately delineate small objects within the remote sensing imagery. To meet these demands effectively, it is critical to integrate two crucial components: global contextual information and spatial detail feature information. In response to this imperative, the multilevel context-aware segmentation network (MCSNet) emerges as a promising solution. MCSNet is engineered to not only model the overarching global context but also extract intricate spatial detail features, thereby optimizing segmentation outcomes. The strength of MCSNet lies in its two pivotal modules, the spatial detail feature extraction (SDFE) module and the refined multiscale feature fusion (RMFF) module. Moreover, to further harness the potential of MCSNet, a multitask learning approach is employed. This approach integrates boundary detection and semantic segmentation, ensuring that the network is well-rounded in its segmentation capabilities. The efficacy of MCSNet is rigorously demonstrated through comprehensive experiments conducted on two established international society for photogrammetry and remote sensing (ISPRS) 2-D semantic labeling datasets: Potsdam and Vaihingen.

However, the existing transformer-based methods for semantic segmentation of remote sensing (RS) images are still with several limitations, which can be summarized into two main aspects: 1) the transformer encoder is generally combined with CNN-based decoder, leading to inconsistency in feature representations; and 2) the strategies for global and local context information utilization are not sufficiently effective. Therefore, in this article, a global-local transformer segmentor (GLOTS) framework is proposed for the semantic segmentation of RS images to acquire consistent feature representations by adopting transformers for both encoding and decoding, in which a masked image modeling (MIM) pretrained transformer encoder is adopted to learn semantic-rich representations of input images and a multiscale global-local transformer decoder is designed to fully exploit the global and local features. Specifically, the transformer decoder uses a feature separation-aggregation module (FSAM) to utilize the feature adequately at different scales and adopts a global-local attention module (GLAM) containing global attention block (GAB) and local attention block (LAB) to capture the global and local context information, respectively. Furthermore, a learnable progressive upsampling strategy (LPUS) is proposed to restore the resolution progressively, which can flexibly recover the fine-grained details in the upsampling process. The experiment results on the three benchmark RS datasets demonstrate that the proposed GLOTS is capable of achieving better performance with some state-of-the-art methods, and the superiority of the proposed framework is also verified by ablation studies.

Therefore, the research on the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images becomes extremely important. However, large data volume and the complex background of HSR remote sensing images put great pressure on the algorithm efficiency. Although the pressure on the GPU can be relieved by down-sampling the image or cropping it into small patches for separate processing, the loss of local details or global contextual information can lead to limited segmentation accuracy. In this study, we propose a multi-field context fusion network (MCFNet), which can preserve both global and local information efficiently. The method consists of three modules: a backbone network, a patch selection module (PSM), and a multi-field context fusion module (FM). Specifically, we propose a confidence-based local selection criterion in the PSM, which adaptively selects local locations in the image that are poorly segmented. Subsequently, the FM dynamically aggregates the semantic information of multiple visual fields centered on that local location to enhance the segmentation of these local locations. Since MCFNet only performs segmentation enhancement on local locations in an image, it can improve segmentation accuracy without consuming excessive GPU memory. We implement our method on two high spatial resolution remote sensing image datasets, DeepGlobe and Potsdam, and compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art methods.

To address the nonnegligible domain gap between different metric spaces, multimodal methods have been introduced that incorporate Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) derived feature maps. This converts multimodal joint semantic segmentation between 3-D point clouds and 2-D optical imagery into a feature extraction process for the 2.5-D product, which is achieved by concatenating LiDAR-derived feather maps, such as digital surface models, with the optical images. However, the information sources for these methods are still limited to 2-D, and certain properties of point clouds are lost as a result. In this study, we propose PointBoost, an effective sequential segmentation framework that can work directly with cross-modal data of LiDAR point clouds and imagery, which is able to extract richer semantic features from cross-dimensional and cross-modal information. Ablation experiments demonstrate that PointBoost can take full advantage of the 3-D topological structure between points and attribute information of point clouds, which is often discarded by other methods.

Inspired by the recently developed domain generalization model WildNet, we propose a domain adaption framework named ""Style and Content Domain Adaptation"" (SCDA) for semantic segmentation tasks involving multiple remote sensing datasets with different data distributions. SCDA uses residual style feature transfer (RSFT) in the shallow layer of the baseline network model to enable source domain images to obtain style features from the target domain and reduce the loss of source domain content information. Considering the scale difference of different ground objects in remote sensing images, SCDA uses the projection of the source domain images, the style-transferred source domain images, and the target domain images to construct a multiscale content adaptation learning (MCAL) loss. This enables the model to capture multiscale target domain content information. Experiments show that the proposed method has obvious domain adaptability in remote sensing image segmentation.

In literature, most successful DCNNs are artificially designed through a large number of experiments, which often consume lots of time and depend on rich domain knowledge. Recently, neural architecture search (NAS), as a direction for automatically designing network architectures, has achieved great success in different kinds of computer vision tasks. For HRSI semantic segmentation, NAS faces two major challenges: (1) The task's high complexity degree, which is caused by the pixel-by-pixel prediction demand in semantic segmentation, leads to a rapid expansion of the search space; (2) HRSI semantic segmentation often needs to exploit long-range dependency (i.e., a large spatial context), which means the NAS technique requires a lot of display memory in the optimization process and can be tough to converge. With the aforementioned considerations in mind, we propose a new decoupling NAS (DNAS) framework to automatically design the network architecture for HRSI semantic segmentation. In DNAS, a hierarchical search space with three levels is recommended: path-level, connection-level, and cell-level. To adapt to this hierarchical search space, we devised a new decoupling search optimization strategy to decrease the memory occupation. More specifically, the search optimization strategy consists of three stages: (1) a light super-net (i.e., the specific search space) in the path-level space is trained to get the optimal path coding; (2) we endowed the optimal path with various cross-layer connections and it is trained to obtain the connection coding; (3) the super-net, which is initialized by path coding and connection coding, is populated with kinds of concrete cell operators and the optimal cell operators are finally determined. It is worth noting that the well-designed search space can cover various network candidates and the optimization process can be done efficiently. Extensive experiments on the publicly open GID and FU datasets showed that our DNAS outperformed the state-of-the-art methods, including artificial networks and NAS methods.",decoupling neural architecture search (DNAS),high-resolution remote sensing image,semantic segmentation,deep learning,,"Dang, Bo",,,,REMOTE SENSING,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the existing semantic segmentation methods have never explored the cross-scale relationships, which are especially important when it comes to the situation that the RS objects cannot be accurately identified, they could be supplemented by the surrounding contents. To address the above concern, we propose a scale-relation joint decoupling network (SRJDN) for the semantic segmentation of RS images by simultaneously considering decoupling scales and decoupling relationships to excavate more complete relationships of multiscale RS objects. The SRJDN is performed by following three steps, namely, scale decoupling (SD), relation decoupling (RD), and fine-granularity guided fusion (FGF). The SD module uses dilated convolution with different rates to decouple RS objects into different scale feature groups, from small to large scales. Afterward, the RD considers all the spatial topological relationships and decouples these relationships according to the scale, which is divided into two parts, including same-scale relation extraction (SSRE) and cross-scale relation extraction (CSRE). The SSRE establishes the graph structures at each scale independently to mine the relationships of same-scale RS objects and the CSRE constructs the graph in a unified pattern between cross-scales to explore cross-scale target relationships. Third, the FGF module regards small-scale features as fine-granularity representation and applies its attention map to guide the learning of other scale features, which could mine more reliable and comprehensive saliency information and improve the feature consistency.

There are two commonly used semantic segmentation methods based on DCNNs: multiscale feature extraction based on deep-level features, and global modeling. The former can better extract object features of different scales in complex scenes. However, this method lacks sufficient spatial information, resulting in poor edge segmentation ability. The latter can effectively solve the problem of limited receptive field in DCNNs obtaining more comprehensive feature extraction results. Unfortunately, this method is prone to misclassification, resulting in incorrect predictions of local pixels.

To address this concern, we propose a scale-separated semantic decoupled transformer (SSDT), which first performs scale-separation in the semantic decoupling process and uses the obtained scale information-rich semantic features to guide the Transformer to extract features. The network consists of five modules, scale-separated patch extraction (SPE), semantic decoupled transformer (SDT), scale-separated feature extraction (SFE), semantic decoupling (SD), and multiview feature fusion decoder (MFFD). In particular, SPE turns the original image into a linear embedding sequence of three scales; SD divides pixels into different semantic clusters by K-means, and further obtains scale information-rich semantic features; SDT improves the intraclass compactness and interclass looseness by calculating the similarity between semantic features and image features, the core of which is decoupled attention.

Firstly, we designed a lightweight multiscale deformable convolutional network (mmsDCNN) with a large receptive field to generate a preliminary prediction probability map at each pixel. The output of the mmsDCNN model is a coarse segmentation result map, which has the same size as the input image. In addition, the preliminary segmentation result map contains rich multiscale features. Then, the multi-level DenseCRF model based on the superpixel level and the pixel level is proposed, which can make full use of the context information of the image at different levels and further optimize the rough segmentation result of mmsDCNN. To be specific, we converted the pixel-level preliminary probability map into a superpixel-level predicted probability map according to the simple linear iterative clustering (SILC) algorithm and defined the potential function of the DenseCRF model based on this. Furthermore, we added the pixel-level potential function constraint term to the superpixel-based Gaussian potential function to obtain a combined Gaussian potential function, which enabled our model to consider the features of various scales and prevent poor superpixel segmentation results from affecting the final result. To restore the contour of the object more clearly, we utilized the Sketch token edge detection algorithm to extract the edge contour features of the image and fused them into the potential function of the DenseCRF model. Finally, extensive experiments on the Potsdam and Vaihingen datasets demonstrated that the proposed model exhibited significant advantages compared to the current state-of-the-art models.",semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery,deep learning,convolutional neural network (CNN),conditional random field (CRF),,,,,,REMOTE SENSING,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are some problems in WSSS of remote sensing images, such as how to locate labels accurately and how to get precise segmentation edges. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework directly transferring the scene classification model to perform semantic segmentation. We first train a multilabel scene classification network as the encoder to obtain the pretrained model, and then, the feature learned by the model is transferred to the decoder. Different from other methods, we propose a saliency map generator (SMG) instead of the class activation map (CAM) for more accurate location information by making pixels belonging to the same class lie close together while different classes are separated in feature space. Meanwhile, we take the superpixel patch as processing unit to provide precise boundary inhibition for the saliency map. To assign semantic labels for each patch, combined with extracted salient region, we propose a module responsible for exploiting the consistency of spatial and semantic similarity between different patches. Finally, we incorporate the above two modules to supervise the training process of the decoder without generating pseudolabels as most methods do, thus simplifying the training process.

These reduce the accuracy of remote sensing (RS) semantic segmentation to a certain extent. Comparing with the pixel-based methods, the graph neural networks (GNNs) usually use objects as input nodes, so they not only have relatively small computational complexity, but also can carry richer semantic information. However, the traditional GNNs are more rely on the context information of the individual samples and lack geographic prior knowledge that reflects the overall situation of the research area.

To address the above problems, we propose a remote sensing semantic segmentation model called knowledge and spatial pyramid distance-based gated graph attention network (KSPGAT), which is based on prior knowledge, spatial pyramid distance and a graph attention network (GAT) with gating mechanism. The model first uses superpixels (geographical objects) to form the nodes of a graph neural network and then uses a novel spatial pyramid distance recognition algorithm to recognize the spatial relationships. Finally, based on the integration of feature similarity and the spatial relationships of geographic objects, a multi-source attention mechanism and gating mechanism are designed to control the process of node aggregation, as a result, the high-level semantics, spatial relationships and prior knowledge can be introduced into a remote sensing semantic segmentation network.

However, supervised learning for semantic segmentation requires a large number of labeled samples, which is difficult to obtain in the field of remote sensing. A new learning paradigm, self-supervised learning (SSL), can be used to solve such problems by pretraining a general model with a large number of unlabeled images and then fine-tuning it on a downstream task with very few labeled samples. Contrastive learning is a typical method of SSL that can learn general invariant features. However, most existing contrastive learning methods are designed for classification tasks to obtain an image-level representation, which may be suboptimal for semantic segmentation tasks requiring pixel-level discrimination. Therefore, we propose a global style and local matching contrastive learning network (GLCNet) for RSI semantic segmentation. Specifically, first, the global style contrastive learning module is used to better learn an image-level representation, as we consider that style features can better represent the overall image features. Next, the local features matching the contrastive learning module is designed to learn the representations of local regions, which is beneficial for semantic segmentation. We evaluate four RSI semantic segmentation datasets, and the experimental results show that our method mostly outperforms the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods and the ImageNet pretraining method. Specifically, with 1% annotation from the original dataset, our approach improves Kappa by 6% on the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) Potsdam dataset relative to the existing baseline. Moreover, our method outperforms supervised learning methods when there are some differences between the datasets of upstream tasks and downstream tasks.

The Markov random field (MRF) model is widely used for semantic segmentation of remote sensing images because of its outstanding spatial description ability. Some scholars have made improvements on MRF models to extract more information or enhance semantic inference.

Second, the segmentation of small targets in the images is often overlooked, leading to a compromise between fine segmentation and model efficiency. Lastly, the data-intensive nature of remote sensing images and the resource-intensive operations of large-scale networks impose significant communication and computation burdens on edge devices, which may not have sufficient resources to handle them effectively.

Self-supervised learning (SSL), which learns useful representations by creating artificial supervised learning problems, has recently emerged as an effective method to learn from unlabelled data. Current SSL methods are generally trained on ImageNet through image-level prediction tasks. We argue that this is suboptimal for application in semantic segmentation of RSIs since it does not take into account spatial position information between objects, which is critical for the segmentation of RSIs characterized by multiobject. In this study, we propose a novel self-supervised dense representation learning method, IndexNet, for the semantic segmentation of RSIs. On the one hand, considering the multiobject characteristics of RSIs, IndexNet learns pixel-level representations by tracking object positions, while maintaining sensitivity to object position changes to ensure that no mismatches are caused. On the other hand, by combining image-level contrast and pixel-level contrast, IndexNet can learn spatiotemporal invariant features. Experimental results show that our method works better than ImageNet pretraining and outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) SSL methods.

However, directly applying ViT to WSSS tasks can introduce challenges. The characteristics of ViT can lead to an oversmoothing problem, particularly in dense scenes of remote sensing images, significantly compromising the effectiveness of class activation maps (CAMs) and posing challenges for segmentation. Moreover, existing methods often adopt multistage strategies, adding complexity and reducing training efficiency. To overcome these challenges, a comprehensive framework Contrastive Token and Foreground Activation (CTFA) based on the ViT architecture for WSSS of remote sensing images is presented.

However, a remote sensing image typically comprises a complex and heterogenous urban landscape with objects in various sizes and materials, which causes challenges to the task. In this work, a novel adaptive fusion network (AFNet) is proposed to improve the performance of very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing image segmentation. To coherently label size-varied ground objects from different categories, we design multilevel architecture with the scale-feature attention module (SFAM). By SFAM, at the location of small objects, low-level features from the shallow layers of convolutional neural network (CNN) are enhanced, whilst for large objects, high-level features from deep layers are enhanced. Thus, the features of size-varied objects could be preserved during fusing features from different levels, which helps to label size-varied objects. As for labeling the category with high intra-class difference and varied scales, the multiscale structure with a scale-layer attention module (SLAM) is utilized to learn representative features, where an adjacent score map refinement module (ACSR) is employed as the classifier. By SLAM, when fusing multiscale features, based on the interested objects scale, feature map from appropriate scale is given greater weights. With such a scale-aware strategy, the learned features can be more representative, which is helpful to distinguish objects for semantic segmentation. Besides, the performance is further improved by introducing several nonlinear layers to the ACSR.

The architecture is further enhanced by an efficient feature-weighted fusion module (FWFM) that systematically integrates remote spatial features with local semantic information to improve segmentation accuracy.

By elaborately exploring the relevance and consistency between change detection and semantic segmentation, the proposed method synchronously enhanced feature separability of two tasks, and it outperformed a single change detection network or semantic segmentation network. Specifically, the proposed approach extracts multilevel bitemporal features by a backbone network, followed by two layer-by-layer decoders for learning change features and semantic features. On one hand, the interactive fusion module (IFM) fuses the changing features and semantic features together to increase the collaboration between the two tasks.

However, as spatial resolution increases, distinguishing the homogeneity of each land class and the heterogeneity between different land classes are challenging. The Markov random field model (MRF) is a widely used method for semantic segmentation due to its effective spatial context description. To improve segmentation accuracy, some MRF-based methods extract more image information by constructing the probability graph with pixel or object granularity units, and some other methods interpret the image from different semantic perspectives by building multilayer semantic classes. However, these MRF-based methods fail to capture the relationship between different granularity features extracted from the image and hierarchical semantic classes that need to be interpreted. In this article, a new MRF-based method is proposed to incorporate the multigranularity information and the multilayer semantic classes together for semantic segmentation of remote sensing images. The proposed method develops a framework that builds a hybrid probability graph on both pixel and object granularities and defines a multiclass-layer label field with hierarchical semantic over the hybrid probability graph. A generative alternating granularity inference is suggested to provide the result by iteratively passing and updating information between different granularities and hierarchical semantics.

Therefore, we propose a remote sensing image semantic segmentation method P-Net to detect small target and enhance edge feature. The proposed network was based on an Encoder-Decoder structure. The decoder included the following components: a progressive small target feature enhancement network (IFEN), a boundary thinning module (BRM), and a feature aggregation module (FIAM). Firstly, the dense side output features of the encoder network were utilized to learn and acquired small target feature information and target edge features. Secondly, the pyramid segmentation attention module was introduced to effectively extract fine-grained and multi-scale spatial information.

However, RS images are captured by airplanes or satellites at high altitudes and long distances, resulting in ground objects of the same category being scattered in various corners of the image. Moreover, objects of different sizes appear simultaneously in RS images. For example, some objects occupy a large area in urban scenes, while others only have small regions. Technically, the above two universal situations pose significant challenges to the segmentation with a high quality for RS images. Based on these observations, this paper proposes a Mask2Former with an improved query (IQ2Former) for this task. The fundamental motivation behind the IQ2Former is to enhance the capability of the query of Mask2Former by exploiting the characteristics of RS images well. First, we propose the Query Scenario Module (QSM), which aims to learn and group the queries from feature maps, allowing the selection of distinct scenarios such as the urban and rural areas, building clusters, and parking lots. Second, we design the query position module (QPM), which is developed to assign the image position information to each query without increasing the number of parameters, thereby enhancing the model's sensitivity to small targets in complex scenarios. Finally, we propose the query attention module (QAM), which is constructed to leverage the characteristics of query attention to extract valuable features from the preceding queries. Being positioned between the duplicated transformer decoder layers, QAM ensures the comprehensive utilization of the supervisory information and the exploitation of those fine-grained details.

Solutions are typically built with a static closed-set perception, where all labels are known a priori. However, in real-world applications, such as remote sensing images, one has to handle objects from unknown classes. Open-set semantic segmentation (OSSS) is an approach that incorporates open-set perception into semantic segmentation, allowing the recognition of unknown classes of objects. Different studies have explored the use of OSSS in remote sensing images. However, their performance is limited due to the poor and overlapped representation of the features extracted from images. This results in an embedding space with low discrimination among the classes. This article introduces a novel loss function called prototypical triplet loss, which uses prototype representation and metric learning to improve open-set recognition. In addition, two open-set classifiers, one based on principal components and the other on prototypical distance, were also proposed once they took advantage of the features obtained by the prototypical triplet loss. Experiments were done with two public remote sensing image datasets: Vaihingen and Potsdam. The results demonstrate that the proposed methods improve OSSS compared to other state-of-the-art approaches. These results reinforce the importance of this type of approach, enabling applications in real systems that require open-set recognition.

It is worth exploring image-text multimodal semantic segmentation for remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional feature fusion and enhanced alignment-based multimodal semantic segmentation model (BEMSeg) for remote sensing images. Specifically, BEMSeg first extracts image and text features by image and text encoders, respectively, and then the features are provided for fusion and alignment to obtain complementary multimodal feature representation. Secondly, a bidirectional feature fusion module is proposed, which employs self-attention and cross-attention to adaptively fuse image and text features of different modalities, thus reducing the differences between multimodal features. For multimodal feature alignment, the similarity between the image pixel features and text features is computed to obtain a pixel-text score map. Thirdly, we propose a category-based pixel-level contrastive learning on the score map to reduce the differences among the same category's pixels and increase the differences among the different categories' pixels, thereby enhancing the alignment effect. Additionally, a positive and negative sample selection strategy based on different images is explored during contrastive learning. Averaging pixel values across different training images for each category to set positive and negative samples compares global pixel information while also limiting sample quantity and reducing computational costs. Finally, the fused image features and aligned pixel-text score map are concatenated and fed into the decoder to predict the segmentation results. Experimental results on the ISPRS Potsdam, Vaihingen, and LoveDA datasets demonstrate that BEMSeg is superior to comparison methods on the Potsdam and Vaihingen datasets, with improvements in mIoU ranging from 0.57% to 5.59% and 0.48% to 6.15%, and compared with Transformer-based methods, BEMSeg also performs competitively on LoveDA dataset with improvements in mIoU ranging from 0.37% to 7.14%.",remote sensing image,multimodal feature fusion,multimodal feature alignment,semantic segmentation,,,,,,REMOTE SENSING,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of the existing few-shot semantic segmentation frameworks are based on prototype learning methods, in which a single support prototype is designed to guide the query set for prediction. However, the visual differences between the support set and the query set make it difficult for a single support prototype, generated from the support set, to comprehensively encapsulate the semantic information of all the query images. This article introduces an adaptive self-supporting prototype learning network designed for few-shot segmentation (FSS), in order to tackle the challenges mentioned earlier. We propose adaptive hyperprototype representation (HPR), which consists of hyperprototype clustering (HPC) and guided prototype matching (GPM), to generate and assign multiple representative prototypes to compensate for the limitations of a single prototype in representing the semantic information of the query images. Specifically, HPC is a parameter-free and adaptive approach, which can extract more representative prototypes by aggregating similar feature vectors utilizing superpixel feature clustering. Meanwhile, GPM can select matched prototypes to provide more accurate guidance, allowing for uniformly aligned representation of multiple prototypes and complex image semantic information. We also introduce self-supporting matching (SSM) prototype learning, which can accurately guide the query set segmentation by acquiring query set prototypes. SSM generates initial pseudo labels for the query set based on the support set prototypes, and further guides the query set using the pseudo labels, along with the query prototypes generated by its own features, thus effectively avoiding visual differences between the support set and query set.

On the other hand, convolutional neural network (CNN), with a different interaction mechanism from transformer-based models, captures more small-scale local features instead of global features. In this article, a new semantic segmentation net framework named SSNet is proposed, which incorporates an encoder-decoder structure, optimizing the advantages of both local and global features.

The former module captures the dependencies between different positions and channels to extract multiscale features, which promotes the segmentation precision on similar objects. The latter module condenses the global information in transformer and injects it into CNN to obtain a broad global field of view, in which the depthwise strip convolution improves the segmentation accuracy on tiny objects. A CNN-based decoder progressively recovers the feature map size, and a block called atrous spatial pyramid pooling is adopted in decoder to obtain a multiscale context. The skip connection is established between the decoder and the encoder, which retains important feature information of the shallow layer network and is conducive to achieving flow of multiscale features.

The existing continual semantic segmentation (CSS) methods of remote sensing (RS) ignore the semantic relationships among pixels across different images, which will lead to disappointing segmentation results, such as edge pixel misclassification and small object omission. In this article, we propose a framework for modeling cross-image semantic relationship dependencies (MiCro), which aims to learn an interclass separable and intraclass cohesive feature space from the pixel relationships across various images to ensure that learned categories can prevent CF in the incremental process. Specifically, we exploit the relationships among pixels of images in minibatch to construct three losses: 1) cross-image feature relationship distillation (CFRD) loss, which builds a well-structured feature space; 2) cross-image intraclass feature cohesion (CIFC) loss, which is devised to make intraclass features more cohesive; and 3) cross-image class-area weighted cross-entropy (CCWCE) loss, which is mainly employed to inversely weight the proportion of category area in minibatch.

Contextual cues, referring to the long-range correlation between pixels, are crucial for achieving accurate segmentation results, particularly for objects with less discriminative characteristics in these images. Currently, most studies are centered on incorporating contextual cues by aggregating context information at the dataset level or image level. However, current research often treats contextual cue modeling at the dataset-level and image level as independent procedures, neglecting the intrinsic correlation between these two feature levels. Consequently, the obtained contextual cues are suboptimal. This issue is particularly critical in the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images.

In this paper, we comprehensively consider the characteristics of deep learning and introduce traditional pattern recognition methods to drive structure learning, which can leverage the corresponding fuzzy logic model to alleviate the aforementioned problem in remote sensing images. Specifically, this paper designs a multiscale bidirectional fuzzy-driven learning network (MBFNet), which takes advantage of both deep learning and fuzzy logic to effectively alleviate the inherent uncertainty of these hard pixels. The structure of convolutional neural networks driven by fuzzy systems also provides a new modelling paradigm for solving the uncertain problem in remote sensing images. Meanwhile, multiscale techniques and bidirectional fusion are introduced to enhance feature aggregation and avoid the potential adverse effects of fuzzy systems, respectively. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively that the proposed MBFNet is competitive.",Remote sensing,semantic segmentation,fuzzy learning,bidirectional fusion,,,,,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, source-to-target translation often brings bias in the translated images causing limited performance, as semantic information is not well considered in the translation procedure. To overcome this limitation, we present an innovative semantic-preserved generative adversarial network (SPGAN), designed to mitigate the image translation bias and then leverage the translated images as well as unlabeled target images by class distribution alignment (CDA) module to train a domain adaptive semantic segmentation model.

However, the existing methods cannot accurately identify false pseudo-labels, suffering from their negative impact on model optimization. The consistency regularization constrains the model by producing consistent predictions robust to the perturbations introduced in the sample or feature domain but requires a sufficient number of training data.

BSSM-SRDA mainly consists of three parts: a shared feature extraction network; a super-resolution image translation module, which incorporates a super-resolution approach to reduce spatial resolution differences and visual style differences of the two domains; a domain-adaptive semantic segmentation module, which combines an adversarial domain adaptation approach to reduce differences at the output level. At the same time, we design a new bidirectional self-supervised learning algorithm for BSSM-SRDA that facilitates mutually beneficial learning of the super-resolution image translation module and the domain-adaptive semantic segmentation module. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over other state-of-the-art methods on two remote-sensing image datasets, with mIoU improvements of 2.5% and 3.2%, respectively.",remote-sensing image,semantic segmentation,domain adaptation,super resolution,self-supervised learning,,,,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By aggregating image features at different depths, the specific representation of the target and the correlation between targets can be modeled in multiple dimensions, allowing the network to better recognize and understand the features of each class of targets to resist various interference factors that affect segmentation performance. We conducted extensive ablation experiments and comparative experiments on the ISPRS Vaihingen and ISPRS Potsdam benchmarks to verify our proposed method. In a large number of experiments, our method achieved the best results, with 84.53% and 87.3% mIoU scores on the Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets, respectively, proving the superiority of our method.

The success of semantic segmentation depends on an effective receptive field (RF) large enough to cover the entire object. Popular methods to enlarge the effective RF include dilated filters, subsampling operations, and stacking layers. Unfortunately, the methods are inefficient or able to cause grid artifacts. Moreover, although the object sizes vary greatly in remote sensing images, the size of the RF cannot reach a compromise between small and large objects. To tackle these problems, we propose adaptive effective receptive convolution (AERFC) for VHR remote sensing images. AERFC adaptively controls the sampling location of convolution and automatically adjusts the effective RF without significantly increasing the parameter number and computational cost. Thus, AERFC reduces the training difficulty, decreases overfitting risk, and reserves details in VHR images.

However, most segmentation methods depend on sufficiently annotated data for specific scenarios. When a large change occurs in the target scenes, model performance drops significantly. Therefore, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation is proposed to alleviate the reliance on expensive per-pixel densely labeled data. In this paper, two key issues of existing domain adaptive (DA) methods are considered: (1) the factors that cause data distribution shifts in RSIs may be complex and diverse, and existing DA approaches cannot adaptively optimize for different domain discrepancy scenarios; (2) domain-invariant feature alignment, based on adversarial training (AT), is prone to excessive feature perturbation, leading to over robust models. To address these issues, we propose an AdvCDA method that guides the model to adapt adversarial perturbation consistency. We combine consistency regularization to consider interdomain feature alignment as perturbation information in the feature space, and thus propose a joint AT and self-training (ST) DA method to further promote the generalization performance of the model. Additionally, we propose a confidence estimation mechanism that determines network stream training weights so that the model can adaptively adjust the optimization direction.

This network comprises an image transformation prediction branch, a global contrastive learning branch, and a local contrastive learning branch. The contrastive learning part of the network employs a novel data augmentation method to simulate positive pairs of the same remote sensing images under different weather conditions, enhancing the model's performance.

Especially in the case of different objects with the same spectrum, the spatial relationship can help interpret remote sensing objects more accurately. Compared with traditional remote sensing object recognition methods, deep learning has the advantages of high accuracy and strong generalizability regarding scene classification and semantic segmentation. However, it is difficult to simultaneously recognize remote sensing objects and their spatial relationship from end-to-end only relying on present deep learning networks. To address this problem, we propose a multi-scale remote sensing image interpretation network, called the MSRIN. The architecture of the MSRIN is a parallel deep neural network based on a fully convolutional network (FCN), a U-Net, and a long short-term memory network (LSTM). The MSRIN recognizes remote sensing objects and their spatial relationship through three processes. First, the MSRIN defines a multi-scale remote sensing image caption strategy and simultaneously segments the same image using the FCN and U-Net on different spatial scales so that a two-scale hierarchy is formed. The output of the FCN and U-Net are masked to obtain the location and boundaries of remote sensing objects. Second, using an attention-based LSTM, the remote sensing image captions include the remote sensing objects (nouns) and their spatial relationships described with natural language. Finally, we designed a remote sensing object recognition and correction mechanism to build the relationship between nouns in captions and object mask graphs using an attention weight matrix to transfer the spatial relationship from captions to objects mask graphs. In other words, the MSRIN simultaneously realizes the semantic segmentation of the remote sensing objects and their spatial relationship identification end-to-end.

Benefiting from its hierarchical abstract ability, the deep semantic segmentation network (DSSN) has achieved tremendous success on RS image semantic segmentation and has gradually become the mainstream technology. However, the superior performance of DSSN highly depends on two conditions: (I) massive quantities of labeled training data exist; (II) the testing data seriously resemble the training data. In actual RS applications, it is difficult to fully meet these conditions due to the RS sensor variation and the distinct landscape variation in different geographic locations. To make DSSN fit the actual RS scenario, this paper exploits the cross-domain RS image semantic segmentation task, which means that DSSN is trained on one labeled dataset (i.e., the source domain) but is tested on another varied dataset (i.e., the target domain). In this setting, the performance of DSSN is inevitably very limited due to the data shift between the source and target domains. To reduce the disadvantageous influence of data shift, this paper proposes a novel objective function with multiple weakly-supervised constraints to learn DSSN for cross-domain RS image semantic segmentation. Through carefully examining the characteristics of cross-domain RS image semantic segmentation, multiple weakly-supervised constraints include the weakly-supervised transfer invariant constraint (WTIC), weakly-supervised pseudo-label constraint (WPLC) and weakly-supervised rotation consistency constraint (WRCC). Specifically, DualGAN is recommended to conduct unsupervised style transfer between the source and target domains to carry out WTIC. To make full use of the merits of multiple constraints, this paper presents a dynamic optimization strategy that dynamically adjusts the constraint weights of the objective function during the training process.

Recently, transformers with self-attention mechanisms have demonstrated superior performance compared with CNNs. However, due to the locality of CNN and the high computational complexity and massive data resource requirements of transformer, neither of them can be well applied in resource-constrained practical remote sensing scenarios. Motivated by the limitations of using either CNNs or transformers alone in the task of semantic segmentation of remote sensing images, a novel cross-model knowledge distillation (KD) framework, named distilling segmenters from CNNs and transformers (DSCTs), is proposed in this article to harness the complementary advantages of both the models. The framework uses a channel-weighted attention-guided feature distillation (CAFD) module to condense the feature from the teacher model and enhance the student model's focus on the teacher-focused regions. In addition, a target-nontarget KD (TNKD) module is proposed that decouples logit distillation into target and nontarget KD to guide the student model in learning the underlying representations and decision boundaries from the teacher model. By learning the complementary knowledge from the teacher, our proposed DSCT framework improves the student's segmentation performance without adding trainable parameters. Experiments on four available remote sensing datasets (ISPRS Potsdam, Vaihingen, GID, and LoveDA) indicate that the proposed DSCT outperforms the state-of-the-art KD methods and demonstrates its effectiveness and robustness.",Convolutional neural networks (CNNs),knowl-edge distillation (KD),remote sensing images,semantic segmen-tation,transformer,"Zhang, Xiangrong",,,,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) using adversarial training, whose purpose is to align the marginal distribution in the output space between the source and target domains, is the most explored and practical approach to address this issue. However, this global alignment approach does not take into account diversities of different regions in a specific image nor the category-level distribution, which leads to the consequence that some regions and categories which are already well aligned between the source and target domains may be incorrectly remapped. Therefore, we propose a region and category adaptive domain discriminator (RCA-DD), aiming to emphasize the differences in regions and categories during the process of alignment. Specifically, on the one hand, we propose an entropy-based regional attention module (ERAM) in domain discriminator to emphasize the importance of difficult-to-align regions. On the other hand, we propose a class-clear module (CCM) to update only the distribution of existing categories in one iteration without affecting all categories.

One challenge is the large image size. High-resolution remote sensing images can have very high spatial resolution, resulting in images with hundreds of millions of pixels. This makes it difficult for deep learning models to process the images efficiently, as they typically require large amounts of memory and computational resources. Another challenge is the complexity of the objects and scenes in the images. High-resolution remote sensing images often contain a wide variety of objects, such as buildings, roads, trees, and water bodies, with complex shapes and textures. This requires deep learning models to be able to capture a wide range of features and patterns to segment the objects accurately. Moreover, remote sensing images can suffer from various types of noise and distortions, such as atmospheric effects, shadows, and sensor noises, which can also increase difficulty in segmentation tasks. To deal with the aforementioned challenges, we propose a new, mixed deep learning model for semantic segmentation on high-resolution remote sensing images.

Recently, several research works have utilized the self-attention operation to capture global dependencies. HRSI have complex scenes and rich details, and the implementation of self-attention on a whole image will introduce redundant information and interfere with semantic segmentation. The detail recovery of HRSI is another challenging aspect of semantic segmentation. Several networks use up-sampling, skip-connections, parallel structure, and enhanced edge features to obtain more precise results. However, the above methods ignore the misalignment of features with different resolutions, which affects the accuracy of the segmentation results. To resolve these problems, this paper proposes a semantic segmentation network based on sparse self-attention and feature alignment (SAANet). Specifically, the sparse position self-attention module (SPAM) divides, rearranges, and resorts the feature maps in the position dimension and performs position attention operations (PAM) in rearranged and restored sub-regions, respectively. Meanwhile, the proposed sparse channel self-attention module (SCAM) groups, rearranges, and resorts the feature maps in the channel dimension and performs channel attention operations (CAM) in the rearranged and restored sub-channels, respectively. SPAM and SCAM effectively model long-range context information and interdependencies between channels, while reducing the introduction of redundant information. Finally, the feature alignment module (FAM) utilizes convolutions to obtain a learnable offset map and aligns feature maps with different resolutions, helping to recover details and refine feature representations.

In this study, we present a multistage semantic segmentation training strategy called SRSSTS, which is based on detail-optimized SRR. SRSSTS addresses the challenges of poor reconstruction quality and low semantic segmentation (SS) accuracy of RS images.

Technically, however, existing fusions are usually implemented by summing or concatenating feature maps in a straightforward way. Seldom do works consider the spatial importance for global-to-local context-information aggregation. This paper proposes a Learnable-Gated CNN (L-GCNN) to address this issue. Methodologically, the Taylor expression of the information-entropy function is first parameterized to design the gate function, which is employed to generate pixelwise weights for coarse-to-fine refinement in the L-GCNN. Accordingly, a Parameterized Gate Module (PGM) was designed to achieve this goal. Then, the single PGM and its densely connected extension were embedded into different levels of the encoder in the L-GCNN to help identify the discriminative feature maps at different scales. With the above designs, the L-GCNN is finally organized as a self-cascaded end-to-end architecture that is able to sequentially aggregate context information for fine segmentation.

Due to the easy availability of image-level labels, weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) based on them has attracted intensive attention. However, existing image-level WSSS methods for RSIs mainly focus on binary segmentation, which are difficult to apply to multiclass scenarios. This study proposes a comprehensive framework for image-level multiclass WSSS of RSIs, consisting of appropriate image-level label generation, high-quality pixel-level pseudo mask generation, and segmentation network iterative training. Specifically, a training sample filtering method, as well as a dataset co-occurrence evaluation metric, is proposed to demonstrate proper image-level training samples. Leveraging multiclass class activation maps (CAMs), an uncertainty-driven pixel-level weighted mask is proposed to relieve the overfitting of labeling noise in pseudo masks when training the segmentation network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve high-quality multiclass WSSS performance with image-level labels, which can attain 94.23% and 90.77% of the mean intersection over union (mIoU) from pixel-level labels for the ISPRS Potsdam and Vaihingen datasets, respectively. Beyond that, for the DeepGlobe dataset with more complex landscapes, the WSSS framework can achieve an accuracy close to 99% of the fully supervised case.

RS image semi-supervised semantic segmentation (RSIS4) tries to improve performance by exploring the unlabeled data, thus significantly reducing the label costs. The core idea of RSIS4 is to transfer the prior information from the labeled to unlabeled pixels, which is commonly achieved by considering the confident part of the softmax prediction as pseudolabels for further supervised learning. However, such pixel-level instruction could inevitably involve uncertainty (e.g., noise and error) due to the extremely limited annotated data at the initialization. To address this issue, in this letter, we employ the prototypes, which contain inbuilt resistance to potentially inaccurate pixels, to bring substantial supervision directly from the embedded feature space. Specifically, we project deep features into the embedding space to generate prototypes, each of which can be regarded as the category-level feature representation of a certain semantic category. These prototypes are then used to perform the pixelwise classification, with the advantage of capturing the global similarity throughout the whole pixels within the category. Moreover, to ensure accurate prototypes, we further introduce pixel-prototype contrast to better explore the discriminative category-level feature embedding.

In this paper, we propose a point-based weakly supervised learning framework called the deep bilateral filtering network (DBFNet) for the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images. Compared with pixel-level labels, point annotations are usually sparse and cannot reveal the complete structure of the objects; they also lack boundary information, thus resulting in incomplete prediction within the object and the loss of object boundaries. To address these problems, we incorporate the bilateral filtering technique into deeply learned representations in two respects. First, since a target object contains smooth regions that always belong to the same category, we perform deep bilateral filtering (DBF) to filter the deep features by a nonlinear combination of nearby feature values, which encourages the nearby and similar features to become closer, thus achieving a consistent prediction in the smooth region. In addition, the DBF can distinguish the boundary by enlarging the distance between the features on different sides of the edge, thus preserving the boundary information well.

This technology has important application value in fields such as land resource surveys, global change monitoring, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, multi-target semantic segmentation of remote sensing images faces challenges such as complex surface features, complex spectral features, and a wide spatial range, resulting in differences in spatial and spectral dimensions among target features. To fully exploit and utilize spectral feature information, focusing on the information contained in spatial and spectral dimensions of multi-spectral images, and integrating external information, this paper constructs the CD-MQANet network structure, where C represents the Channel Creator module and D represents the Dual-Path Encoder. The Channel Creator module (CCM) mainly includes two parts: a generator block and a spectral attention module. The generator block aims to generate spectral channels that can expand different ground target types, while the spectral attention module can enhance useful spectral information. Dual-Path Encoders include channel encoders and spatial encoders, intended to fully utilize spectrally enhanced images while maintaining the spatial information of the original feature map. The decoder of CD-MQANet is a multitasking decoder composed of four types of attention, enhancing decoding capabilities. The loss function used in the CD-MQANet consists of three parts, which are generated by the intermediate results of the CCM, the intermediate results of the decoder, and the final segmentation results and label calculation. We performed experiments on the Potsdam dataset and the Vaihingen dataset. Compared to the baseline MQANet model, the CD-MQANet network improved mean F1 and OA by 2.03% and 2.49%, respectively, on the Potsdam dataset, and improved mean F1 and OA by 1.42% and 1.25%, respectively, on the Vaihingen dataset.

While deep learning models have shown impressive performance in this task, challenges arise when applying them to data from other domains without fine-tuning, due to domain gaps. Domain adaptation (DA) has emerged as a solution to bridge this gap. Existing works mainly focus on unsupervised DA (UDA), which lags far behind fully supervised models. However, active DA (ADA) methods focused on natural images face challenges when applied to remote sensing images due to pronounced domain gaps and error unawareness problems. In this work, we propose a novel error-aware DA framework for remote sensing imagery semantic segmentation, called EasySeg, via interactive learning and active learning. First, we introduce a point-level labeling strategy, named ""See-First-Ask-Later"" (SFAL), combining both interactive and active learning manners, allowing obvious errors and information-rich pixels to be annotated easily and efficiently. Then, we introduce an interactive semantic segmentation network (ISS-Net), which can perform automatic semantic segmentation and interactive refinement. Based on the acquired target point-level labels, ISS-Net generates dense and accurate pseudo-labels to enhance DA performance through retraining with consistency regularization. Comprehensive experiments on two tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art ADA methods in terms of overall accuracy (OA), mean accuracy (MA), $F1$ score, and mean intersection of union (mIoU) with lower labeling costs, even surpassing some fully supervised models.

Compared to other application scenarios, the objects in the remote sensing field are larger and have a wider range of distribution. In addition, some similar targets, such as roads and concrete-roofed buildings, are easily misjudged. However, existing convolutional neural networks operate only in the local receptive field, and this limits their capacity to represent the potential association between different objects and surrounding features. This paper develops a Multi-task Quadruple Attention Network (MQANet) to address the above-mentioned issues and increase segmentation accuracy. The MQANet contains four attention modules: position attention module (PAM), channel attention module (CAM), label attention module (LAM), and edge attention module (EAM). The quadruple attention modules obtain global features by expanding the receptive fields of the network and introducing spatial context information in the label. Then, a multi-tasking mechanism which splits a multi-category segmentation task into several binary-classification segmentation tasks is introduced to improve the ability to identify similar objects.

The ideal scenario of DL application requires a vast number of annotation data with the same feature distribution as the area of interest. However, obtaining such enormous training sets that suit the data distribution of the target area is highly time-consuming and costly. Consistency-regularization-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods have gained growing popularity thanks to their ease of implementation and remarkable performance. However, there have been limited applications of SSL in remote sensing. This study comprehensively analyzed several advanced SSL methods based on consistency regularization from the perspective of data- and model-level perturbation. Then, an end-to-end SSL approach based on a hybrid perturbation paradigm was introduced to improve the DL model's performance with a limited number of labels. The proposed method integrates the semantic boundary information to generate more meaningful mixing images when performing data-level perturbation. Additionally, by using implicit pseudo-supervision based on model-level perturbation, it eliminates the need to set extra threshold parameters in training. Furthermore, it can be flexibly paired with the DL model in an end-to-end manner, as opposed to the separated training stages used in the traditional pseudo-labeling.

As the spatial resolution increases, the remote sensing images can capture more detailed information and make hierarchical semantic interpretation possible. However, hierarchical semantic segmentation encounters high heterogeneity not only within the intra-layer classes but also among inter-layer classes. It brings challenges to semantic segmentation methods such as the convolutional neural network (CNN). In this article, a hierarchical self-learning knowledge inference model (HSKIM) based on the Markov random field (MRF) model is proposed for hierarchical semantic segmentation of remote sensing images. The HSKIM model introduces a new framework that integrates the advantages of CNN-based data feature learning and MRF-based hierarchical semantic inference. It contains three modules: data learning module ( $\boldsymbol {D}$ ), inference units generation module ( $\boldsymbol {I}$ ), and self-learning knowledge inference module ( $\boldsymbol {S}$ ). The module $\boldsymbol {D}$ uses CNN to learn specific data features layer by layer and extract preliminary geographical objects as the initial results. The module I refines the geographical objects using a novel boundary-preservation trick to generate more accurate inference units with clear geographical meaning. The module S introduces a hierarchical object-based MRF model to implement semantic inference among intra-layer and inter-layer inference units, guided by the spatial interactions and geographical criteria. This module can self-learn and update the relationship between classes iteratively and provide the final result.

However, many methods fail to solve the segmentation misclassification problems for HSR images due to just considering one layer of granularity information, such as the pixel granularity layer or the object granularity layer. This paper presents a hybrid Markov random field model for the semantic segmentation of HSR images by paying closer attention to capture the multi-granularity information. In this model, a probability graph with a multilayer structure is first built to represent different granularities information. Then, a hybrid label field is developed to model the multi-granularity classes with the form of a vector, and a new joint distribution is designed to capture the isotropic spatial interactions within each layer of the hybrid label field and the anisotropic spatial interactions between different layers. A generative probabilistic inference is proposed to realize the synergy between the multi-granularity information and the hybrid label interactions by iteratively updating the likelihood function and the joint probability of the hybrid label. The final semantic segmentation result can be achieved when the probabilistic inference converges.

Deep Learning, especially via pre-trained models, currently offers a highly promising approach for the semantic segmentation of Remote Sensing Imagery (RSI). However, effectively adapting these pre-trained models to RSI tasks remains challenging. Typically, these models undergo fine-tuning for specialized tasks, involving modifications to their parameters or structure of the original architecture, which may impact their inherent generalization capabilities. Furthermore, robust pre-trained models on nature images are not specifically designed for RSI, presenting challenges in their direct application to RSI tasks. To alleviate these problems, our study introduces a light-weight Enhanced Semantic-positional Feature Fusion Network (ESFFNet), leveraging diverse pre-trained image encoders alongside extensive EO data. The proposed method begins by leveraging pre-trained encoders, specifically Vision Transformer (ViT)-based and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models, to extract deep semantic and precise positional features respectively, without additional training. Following this, we introduce the Enhanced Semantic-positional Feature Fusion Module (ESFFM). This module adeptly merges semantic features derived from the ViT-based encoder with spatial features extracted from the CNN-based encoder. Such integration is realized via multi-scale feature fusion, local and long-distance feature integration, and dense connectivity strategies, leading to a robust feature representation. Finally, the Primary Segmentation-guided Fine Extraction Module (PSFEM) further bolsters the precision of remote sensing image segmentation. Collectively, these two modules constitute our light-weight decoder, with a parameter size of less than 4 M. Our approach is evaluated on two distinct water-body datasets, indicating superiority over other leading segmentation techniques.

In this paper, a semantic segmentation method for remote sensing images based on Swin Transformer fusion with a Gabor filter is proposed. First, a Swin Transformer is used as the backbone network to extract image information at different levels. Then, the texture and edge features of the input image are extracted with a Gabor filter, and the multilevel features are merged by introducing a feature aggregation module (FAM) and an attentional embedding module (AEM).

Unlike previous works that mainly focused on optimizing the segmentation model, which did not enable the severe problems caused by the unaligned resolution between the training and testing data to be fundamentally solved, we propose to integrate SR techniques with the existing framework to enhance the segmentation performance. The feasibility of the proposed method was evaluated by utilizing representative multi-source study materials: high-resolution (HR) aerial and low-resolution (LR) panchromatic satellite imagery as the training and testing data, respectively. Instead of directly conducting building segmentation from the LR imagery by using the model trained using the HR imagery, the deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) model was first adopted to super-resolved LR imagery into SR space, which could mitigate the influence of the difference in resolution between the training and testing data.

To deal with this issue, domain adaptation has been widely utilized to enhance the generalization abilities of the segmentation models. Most of the existing domain adaptation methods, which based on image-to-image translation, firstly transfer the source images to the pseudo-target images, adapt the classifier from the source domain to the target domain. However, these unidirectional methods suffer from the following two limitations: (1) they do not consider the inverse procedure and they cannot fully take advantage of the information from the other domain, which is also beneficial, as confirmed by our experiments; (2) these methods may fail in the cases where transferring the source images to the pseudo-target images is difficult. In this paper, in order to solve these problems, we propose a novel framework BiFDANet for unsupervised bidirectional domain adaptation in the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images.

Traditional methods learn to segment using direct supervision of paired data, yet fall short by not fully addressing the noncausal biases behind RS images. These include intra-image biases, such as varying background and object appearance, and inter-image biases, such as inconsistent geographical environments and class distributions, which can mislead models to infer by relying on these biases. Given the high cost and effort needed for pixelwise annotation, the limited volume of RS images exacerbates this problem.

Consequently, the compact feature space is more robust to the varying appearance. As for eliminating the inter-image level biases, our I-3-CI further explores the inter-image contrastive learning of all pixels within the entire dataset. To overcome the difficulty of learning from all pixels of the dataset simultaneously, our I-3-CI introduces a set of proxy prototype features to keep track of the global centroids for the features of different categories.

Attention mechanisms and transformer can effectively model long-range dependencies, but they often result in high computational costs when being applied to process HRSIs. In this article, an encoder-decoder network (MSGCNet) is proposed to fully and efficiently model multiscale context and long-range dependencies of HRSIs.

Earlier land cover classification methods used traditional image segmentation techniques, which cannot fully and comprehensively extract the ground information in remote sensing images. Therefore, it is necessary to integrate the advanced techniques of deep learning into the study of semantic segmentation of remote sensing images. However, most of current high-resolution image segmentation networks have disadvantages such as large parameters and high network training cost. In view of the problems above, a lightweight land cover classification model via semantic segmentation, DeepGDLE, is proposed in this paper. The model DeepGDLE is designed on the basis of DeeplabV3+ network and utilizes the GhostNet network instead of the backbone feature extraction network in the encoder. Using Depthwise Separable Convolution (DSC) instead of dilation convolution. This reduces the number of parameters and increases the computational speed of the model. By optimizing the dilation rate of parallel convolution in the ASPP module, the ""grid effect"" is avoided. ECANet lightweight channel attention mechanism is added after the feature extraction module and the pyramid pooling module to focus on the important weights of the model. Finally, the loss function Focal Loss is utilized to solve the problem of category imbalance in the dataset. As a result, the model DeepGDLE effectively reduces the parameters of the network model and the network training cost. And extensive experiments compared with several existing semantic segmentation algorithms such as DeeplabV3+, UNet, SegNet, etc. show that DeepGDLE improves the quality and efficiency of image segmentation. Therefore, compared to other networks, the DeepGDLE network model can be more effectively applied to land cover classification.

The mechanism is based on the solution of the assignment problem, and thus, the proposed method is called category-level assignment for UDA (ClA-UDA). In ClA-UDA, a category-level assignment problem with additional constraints is defined for UDA tasks, and the solution is provided. Based on the solution, an assignment-based image-to-image transferring algorithm (AIT) is first proposed to transfer the source-domain images based on the style of the target-domain images. AIT minimizes a weighted discrepancy and provides an analytical solution for the transfer. Two assignment-based alignment losses are then introduced to align the source and target domains based on the category-level relationship in a concise way. To validate the performance of ClA-UDA, three VHR RSI datasets are employed, and six UDA tasks are designed. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the results demonstrate the superiority of ClA-UDA compared with the existing methods.",Training,Semantic segmentation,Remote sensing,Task analysis,Adaptation models,"Chanussot, Jocelyn",,,,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING,,Semantics,Adversarial machine learning,Assignment problem,category-level relationship,semantic segmentation,unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, deep learning-based RS image semantic segmentation methods usually require substantial manual pixelwise annotations, which are expensive and hard to obtain in practice. Although the existing semisupervised RS semantic segmentation methods effectively reduce dependence on labeled data, they generally focus on information consistency between labeled and unlabeled images, but ignore the potential context information between different areas of the RS image. In fact, the objects contained in an RS image usually have some long-range dependence between each other, since trees are usually on both sides of a road, and the middle of two rows of houses is commonly a road. Therefore, we believe that the potential dependencies between different areas of the RS image should be beneficial to reduce the label dependence of RS semantic segmentation. Based on this point, we propose a novel semisupervised RS image semantic segmentation network named SegMind, which is based on mean-teacher (MT) architecture and adopts masked image modeling (MIM) to enhance information interactions of different areas. Moreover, contrastive learning (CL) and entropy loss are introduced to SegMind framework to further improve the linear separability and prediction confidence of the proposed model.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have an excellent ability to extract local features and have been widely applied as a feature extractor for various vision tasks. However, due to the inherent inductive bias of convolution operation, CNNs inevitably have limitations in modeling long-range dependencies. Transformer can capture global representations well but unfortunately ignores the details of local features and has high computational and spatial complexity in processing high-resolution feature maps. In this article, we propose a novel hybrid architecture for HRRS image segmentation, termed Enhancing Multiscale Representations with Transformer (EMRT), to exploit the advantages of convolution operations and Transformer to enhance multiscale representation learning. We incorporate the deformable self-attention mechanism in the Transformer to automatically adjust the receptive field and design an encoder-decoder architecture accordingly to achieve efficient context modeling. Specifically, CNN is constructed to extract feature representations. In the encoder, local features and global representations at different resolutions are extracted by the CNN and Transformer, respectively, and fused in an interactive manner. Moreover, a separate spatial branch is designed to extract multiscale contextual information as queries, and global dependencies between features at different scales are efficiently established by the decoder.

Until now, deep semantic segmentation network (DSSN) has achieved a certain degree of success on semantic segmentation of RS imagery and can obviously outperform the traditional methods based on hand-crafted features. As a classic data-driven technique, DSSN can be trained by an end-to-end mechanism and is competent for employing lowlevel and mid-level cues (i.e., the discriminative image structure) to understand RS images. However, its interpretability and reliability are poor due to the nature weakness of the data-driven deep learning methods. By contrast, human beings have an excellent inference capacity and can reliably interpret RS imagery with the basic RS domain knowledge. Ontological reasoning is an ideal way to imitate and employ the domain knowledge of human beings. However, it is still rarely explored and adopted in the RS domain. As a solution of the aforementioned critical limitation of DSSN, this study proposes a collaboratively boosting framework (CBF) to combine the data-driven deep learning module and knowledge-guided ontology reasoning module in an iterative manner. The deep learning module adopts the DSSN architecture and takes the integration of the original image and inferred channels as the input of the DSSN. In addition, the ontology reasoning module is composed of intra-and extra-taxonomy reasoning. More specifically, the intra-taxonomy reasoning directly corrects misclassifications of the deep learning module based on the domain knowledge, which is the key to improve the classification performance. The extra-taxonomy reasoning aims to generate the inferred channels beyond the current taxonomy to improve the discriminative performance of DSSN in the original RS image space. On the one hand, benefiting from the referred channels from the ontology reasoning module, the deep learning module using the integration of the original image and referred channels can achieve better classification performance than only using the original image. On the other hand, better classification results from the deep learning module further improve the performance of the ontology reasoning module. As a whole, the deep learning and ontology reasoning modules are mutually boosted in the iterations. Extensive experiments on two publicly open RS datasets such as UCM and ISPRS Potsdam show that our proposed CBF can outperform the competitive baselines with a large margin. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

However, in remote sensing scenarios with extreme intra-class variations and cluttered backgrounds, such pixel-level correlations may produce tremendous mismatches, resulting in semantic ambiguity between the query foreground (FG) and background (BG) pixels. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Agent Mining Transformer, which adaptively mines a set of local-aware agents to construct agent-level semantic correlation. Compared with pixel-level semantics, the given agents are equipped with local-contextual information and possess a broader receptive field. At this point, different query pixels can selectively aggregate the fine-grained local semantics of different agents, thereby enhancing the semantic clarity between query FG and BG pixels. Concretely, the Agent Learning Encoder is first proposed to erect the optimal transport plan that arranges different agents to aggregate support semantics under different local regions. Then, for further optimizing the agents, the Agent Aggregation Decoder and the Semantic Alignment Decoder are constructed to break through the limited support set for mining valuable class-specific semantics from unlabeled data sources and the query image itself, respectively.

The accuracy of segments boundaries delineation influences the quality of the whole segmented areas explicitly. However, widely-used segmentation loss functions such as BCE, IoU loss or Dice loss do not penalize misalignment of boundaries sufficiently.

Its essence lies in designing an unsupervised instance discrimination pretext task to extract image features from a large number of unlabeled images that are beneficial for downstream tasks. However, existing instance discrimination-based SSCL suffers from two limitations when applied to the RSI semantic segmentation task: 1) positive sample confounding issue (SCI), SSCL treats different augmentations of the same RSI as positive samples, but the richness, complexity, and imbalance of RSI ground objects lead to the model actually pulling a variety of different ground objects closer while pulling positive samples closer, which confuse the feature of different ground objects, and 2) feature adaptation bias, SSCL treats RSI patches containing various ground objects as individual instances for discrimination and obtains instance-level features, which are not fully adapted to pixel-level or object-level semantic segmentation tasks. To address the above limitations, we consider constructing samples containing single ground objects to alleviate positive SCI and make the model obtain object-level features from the contrastive between single ground objects. Meanwhile, we observed that the discrimination information can be mapped to specific regions in RSI through the gradient of unsupervised contrastive loss, and these specific regions tend to contain single ground objects. Based on this, we propose contrastive learning with gradient-guided sampling strategy (GraSS) for RSI semantic segmentation. GraSS consists of two stages: 1) the instance discrimination warm-up stage to provide initial discrimination information to the contrastive loss gradients and 2) the gradient-guided sampling contrastive training stage to adaptively construct samples containing more singular ground objects using the discrimination information. Experimental results on three open datasets demonstrate that GraSS effectively enhances the performance of SSCL in high-resolution RSI semantic segmentation. Compared with eight baseline methods from six different types of SSCL, GraSS achieves an average improvement of 1.57% and a maximum improvement of 3.58% in terms of mean intersection over the union (mIoU).

To enhance the distinguishability of learnt representations, attention modules were developed and applied to RSI, resulting in satisfactory improvements. However, these designs capture contextual information by equally handling all the pixels regardless of whether they around edges. Therefore, blurry boundaries are generated, rising high uncertainties in classifying vast adjacent pixels.

However, current RS imagery instance segmentation methods mostly follow the fully supervised paradigm, relying on expensive pixel-level labels. Moreover, remote sensing imagery suffers from cluttered backgrounds and significant variations in target scales, making segmentation challenging. To accommodate these limitations, we propose a semantic attention enhancement and structured model-guided multi-scale weakly supervised instance segmentation network (SASM-Net). Building upon the modeling of spatial relationships for weakly supervised instance segmentation, we further design the multi-scale feature extraction module (MSFE module), semantic attention enhancement module (SAE module), and structured model guidance module (SMG module) for SASM-Net to enable a balance between label production costs and visual processing. The MSFE module adopts a hierarchical approach similar to the residual structure to establish equivalent feature scales and to adapt to the significant scale variations of instances in RS imagery. The SAE module is a dual-stream structure with semantic information prediction and attention enhancement streams. It can enhance the network's activation of instances in the images and reduce cluttered backgrounds' interference. The SMG module can assist the SAE module in the training process to construct supervision with edge information, which can implicitly lead the model to a representation with structured inductive bias, reducing the impact of the low sensitivity of the model to edge information caused by the lack of fine-grained pixel-level labeling.

The dramatic variations in grayscale and the stacking of categories within RSIs lead to unstable inter-class variance and exacerbate the uncertainty around category boundaries. However, existing methods typically emphasize spatial information while overlooking frequency insights, making it difficult to achieve desirable results. To address these challenges, we propose a novel dual-domain fusion network that integrates both spatial and frequency features. For grayscale variations, a multi-level wavelet frequency decomposition module (MWFD) is introduced to extract and integrate multi-level frequency features to enhance the distinctiveness between spatially similar categories. To mitigate the uncertainty of boundaries, a type-2 fuzzy spatial constraint module (T2FSC) is proposed to achieve flexible higher-order fuzzy modeling to adaptively constrain the boundary features in the spatial by constructing upper and lower membership functions. Furthermore, a dual-domain feature fusion (DFF) module bridges the semantic gap between the frequency and spatial features, effectively realizes semantic alignment and feature fusion between the dual domains, which further improves the accuracy of segmentation results.

In this letter, we propose AMMUNet, a UNet-based framework that employs multiscale attention map (AM) merging, comprising two key innovations: the attention map merging mechanism (AMMM) module and the granular multihead self-attention (GMSA).

Different mangrove species exhibit significant differences in ecological functions and environmental responses, so accurately identifying and distinguishing these species is crucial for ecological protection and monitoring. However, mangrove species recognition faces challenges, such as morphological similarity, environmental complexity, target size variability, and data scarcity. Traditional mangrove monitoring methods mainly rely on expensive and operationally complex multispectral or hyperspectral remote sensing sensors, which have high data processing and storage costs, hindering large-scale application and popularization. Although hyperspectral monitoring is still necessary in certain situations, the low identification accuracy in routine monitoring severely hinders ecological analysis. To address these issues, this paper proposes the UrmsNet segmentation network, aimed at improving identification accuracy in routine monitoring while reducing costs and complexity. It includes an improved lightweight convolution SCConv, an Adaptive Selective Attention Module (ASAM), and a Cross-Layer Feature Fusion Module (CLFFM). ASAM adaptively extracts and fuses features of different mangrove species, enhancing the network's ability to characterize mangrove species with similar morphology and in complex environments. CLFFM combines shallow details and deep semantic information to ensure accurate segmentation of mangrove boundaries and small targets.Additionally, this paper constructs a high-quality RGB image dataset for mangrove species segmentation to address the data scarcity problem.

Traditional 'local-to-local' transfer from small, local datasets to another target dataset plays an ever-shrinking role due to RSIs' diverse distribution shifts. Instead, SSL promotes a 'global-to-local' transfer paradigm, in which generalized models pre-trained on arbitrarily large unlabeled datasets are fine-tuned to the target dataset to overcome data distribution shifts. However, the SSL pre-trained models may contain both useful and useless features for the downstream semantic segmentation task, due to the gap between the SSL tasks and the downstream task. To adapt such pre-trained models to semantic segmentation tasks, traditional supervised fine-tuning methods that use only a small number of labeled samples may drop out useful features due to overfitting. The main reason behind this is that supervised fine-tuning aims to map a few training samples from the high-dimensional, sparse image space to the low-dimensional, compact semantic space defined by the downstream labels, resulting in a degradation of the distinguishability. To address the above issues, we propose a class distinguishability-enhanced self-training (CDEST) method to support global-to-local transfer. First, the self-training module in CDEST introduces a semi-supervised learning mechanism to fully utilize the large amount of unlabeled data in the downstream task to increase the size and diversity of the training data, thus alleviating the problem of biased overfitting of the model. Second, the supervised and semi-supervised contrastive learning modules of CDEST can explicitly enhance the class distinguishability of features, helping to preserve the useful features learned from pre-training while adapting to downstream tasks. We evaluate the proposed CDEST method on four RSI semantic segmentation datasets, and our method achieves optimal experimental results on all four datasets compared to supervised fine-tuning as well as three semi-supervised fine-tuning methods.",semantic segmentation,remote sensing (RS),transfer learning,fine-tuning method,contrastive learning,"Yang, Hemeng","Xu, Jun","Peng, Chengli","Li, Haifeng",REMOTE SENSING,,self-training,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this article, a boundary-sensitive network (BSNet) is proposed to address this problem via dynamic hybrid gradient convolution (DHGC) and coordinate sensitive attention (CSA). Specifically, in the feature extraction stage, we propose DHGC to replace vanilla convolution (VC), which adaptively aggregates one VC kernel and two gradient convolution kernels (GCKs) into a new operator to enhance boundary information extraction.

Related experimental results show that directly transferring the previously proposed framework to the current domain is prone to produce unsatisfactory results with incomplete objects and irrelevant distractors. Such phenomena can be attributed to the lack of modules specifically designed for the complex characteristics of remote sensing images, e.g., great intra-class diversity and low target-background contrast. In this article, we propose a conceptually simple and easy-to-implement framework to tackle the aforementioned problems. Specifically, our innovative design embodies two main aspects: 1) the support mask is progressively parsed into multiple valuable subregions that can be further exploited to compute local descriptors with segmentation cues about intractable parts; and 2) the base-class memories stored in the meta-training phase are replayed and leveraged for the distillation of novel-class prototypes, where the commonalities between classes are adequately explored, more in line with the concept of learning to learn.

The core idea is to pull positive samples defined by data augmentation techniques closer together while pushing apart randomly sampled negative samples to serve as supervised learning signals. This strategy is based on the strict identity hypothesis, i.e., positive samples are strictly defined by each (anchor) sample's own augmentation transformation. However, this leads to the over-instancing of the features learned by the model and the loss of the ability to fully identify ground objects. Therefore, we proposed a relaxed identity hypothesis governing the feature distribution of different instances within the same class of features. The implementation of the relaxed identity hypothesis requires the sampling and discrimination of the relaxed identical samples. In this study, to realize the sampling of relaxed identical samples under the unsupervised learning paradigm, the remote sensing image was used to show that nearby objects often present a large correlation; neighborhood sampling was carried out around the anchor sample; and the similarity between the sampled samples and the anchor samples was defined as the semantic similarity. To achieve sample discrimination under the relaxed identity hypothesis, the feature loss was calculated and reordered for the samples in the relaxed identical sample queue and the anchor samples, and the feature loss between the anchor samples and the sample queue was defined as the feature similarity. Through the sampling and discrimination of the relaxed identical samples, the leap from instance-level features to class-level features was achieved to a certain extent while enhancing the network's invariant learning of features.

Toward such goal, convolutional networks can learn specific and adaptable features based on the data. However, these networks are not capable of processing a whole remote sensing image, given its huge size. To overcome such limitation, the image is processed using fixed size patches. The definition of the input patch size is usually performed empirically (evaluating several sizes) or imposed (by network constraint). Both strategies suffer from drawbacks and could not lead to the best patch size. To alleviate this problem, several works exploited multicontext information by combining networks or layers. This process increases the number of parameters, resulting in a more difficult model to train. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to perform semantic segmentation of remote sensing images that exploits a multicontext paradigm without increasing the number of parameters while defining, in training time, the best patch size.

While processing these varying patches, the network provides a score for each patch size, helping in the definition of the best size for the current scenario.

By extracting ground object targets from remote sensing images, more detailed and accurate ground object information in the imaging area can be obtained, providing data support for high-altitude reconnaissance, precision guidance, and terrain matching. However, with the rapid increase in data volume, the current low level of intelligent and automated target extraction methods is difficult to embrace the demand. Traditional image extraction techniques contain edge detection, threshold segmentation, and region segmentation. These methods have good segmentation performance for remote sensing targets with significant contour boundaries but lack the ability of adaptive adjustment while facing complex and ever-changing remote sensing targets. Convolutional neural networks have stronger representation ability, scalability, and robustness than traditional methods by providing multi-level semantic information in images. Due to the uneven distribution, blurred edges, and variable scales of ground objects in remote sensing images, convolutional neural networks are prone to losing edge information and multi-scale feature information during feature extraction. In addition, cloud cover of remote sensing targets in complex scenes exacerbates the loss of target edge and multi-scale information, making it more difficult for convolutional neural networks to accurately segment remote sensing ground objects. In order to solve the above problems, we propose a segmentation method that uses deep residual networks as the backbone and combines attention guidance and multi-feature fusion to enhance the network's ability to segment remote sensing image ground object edges and multi-scale objects.Methods We propose a remote sensing image semantic segmentation network called AMSNet, which combines attention guidance and multi-feature fusion. In the Encoder Section, D_ Resnet50 is applied as the backbone network to extract the main feature information from remote sensing images, which can enhance the acquisition of detailed information such as edge and small-scale targets in remote sensing images. The category guidance channel attention module is inserted into the backbone to enhance the network's segmentation ability for difficult-to-distinguish and irregularly shaped areas in remote sensing images. A feature reuse module is added to the backbone network to solve the loss of edge detail information and the disappearance of scattered small-scale targets during feature extraction. In the Decoder Section, the cross-regional feature fusion module is applied to fuse the multi-feature information, improving the acquisition of multi-scale target information. Multi-scale loss fusion module is also joined to further enhance the segmentation performance of the network for multi-scale targets.Results and Discussions From the analysis of experimental results on the remote sensing image dataset of the plateau region and the remote sensing image dataset of the plateau region under cloud interference, compared with other semantic segmentation networks, the proposed network has better segmentation performance (Table 6 and Table 7) regardless of cloud interference. In addition, the segmentation performance is less affected by cloud interference. Even under cloud interference, the segmentation accuracy of ground targets is only 1. 10 percentage points lower than that without cloud interference in mIoU, 0. 58 percentage points lower than that in mPa, and 0. 71 percentage points lower than that in mF1, which is lower than the influence of other semantic segmentation networks on segmentation effect under different cloud meteorological interference conditions. In addition, in order to verify the generalization performance of the AMSNet network segmentation effect, the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) dataset in the Vaihingen region of Germany is selected. In order to better fit the picture size, number of grouping convolutions of feature multiplexing modules in the AMSNet network is reduced to four groups. From the experimental results in Table 8, the network still performs better than other networks. This network is compared with PspNet and OCNet, with mIoU increased by 5. 09 percentage points and 5. 57 percentage points, Deeplabv3+ network with mIoU by 3. 47 percentage points, mPa by 3. 56 percentage points, and mF1 by 2. 78 percentage points. From the segmenting effect diagram of Fig. 8, this network has a lower error rate, fewer omission, and a more accurate segmenting boundary for building edges and small-scale cars than other networks.Conclusions We propose a network model based on encoding-decoding structure-AMSNet. In the encoding part, the D_Resnet50 network is applied as the backbone to extract the main feature information of remote sensing images. We also use a category-guided channel attention module to reduce the interference of channel noise on segmented objects and improve the segmentation effect of targets in difficult-to-distinguish areas. We embed a feature reuse module to compensate for the problem of target edge loss and small-scale target loss during the feature extraction process. In the decoding part, the cross-regional feature fusion module is designed to integrate multi-layer features and combine the multiscale loss fusion module to calculate the feature loss at different scales to improve the segmentation effect of the network on multi-scale targets. This network conducts experiments on the remote sensing image dataset of the plateau region, remote sensing image dataset of the plateau region under cloud interference, and a public dataset. Compared with semantic segmentation networks such as BiseNetv2, PspNet, and Deeplabv3+, the proposed network achieves better results in the evaluation indicators of mIoU, mPa, and mF1. The visualization results show that the proposed network can effectively segment the ground object targets and scattered multi-scale targets in the interlaced and hard-to-distinguish areas in the remote sensing images, and it has good segmentation performance and good robustness in cloud interference.",remote sensing image,semantic segmentation,attention mechanism,multi-scale feature,,Lu Ruitao,Chen Guangchen,,,ACTA OPTICA SINICA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Semi-supervised methods, combining consistency regularization (CR) with self-training, offer a solution to efficiently utilize labeled and unlabeled data. However, these methods encounter challenges due to imbalanced data ratios. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a self-training approach named dynamic and adaptive self-training (DAST), which is combined with dynamic pseudo-label sampling (DPS), distribution matching (DM), and adaptive threshold updating (ATU).

Among different types of building extraction methods, the polygonal segmentation methods produce vector building polygons that are in a more realistic format compared with those obtained from pixel-wise semantic labeling and contour-based methods. However, existing polygonal building segmentation methods usually require a perfect segmentation map and a complex post-processing procedure to guarantee the polygonization quality, or produce inaccurate vertex prediction results that suffer from wrong vertex sequence, self-intersections, fixed vertex quantity, etc. In our previous work, we have proposed a method for polygonal building segmentation from remote sensing images that addresses the above limitations of existing methods. In this paper, we propose PolyCity, which further extends and improves our previous work in terms of the application scenario, methodology design, and experimental results. Our proposed PolyCity contains the following three components: (1) a pixel-wise multi-task network for learning the semantic and geometric information via three tasks, i.e., building segmentation, boundary prediction, and edge orientation prediction; (2) a simple but effective vertex selection module (VSM), which effectively bridges the gap between pixel-wise and graph-based models via transforming the segmentation map into valid polygon vertices; (3) a graph-based vertex refinement network (VRN) for automatically adjusting the coordinates of VSM-generated valid polygon vertices, producing the final building polygons with more precise vertices. Results on three large-scale building extraction datasets demonstrate that our proposed PolyCity generates vector building footprints with more accurate vertices, edges, shapes, etc., achieving significant vertex score improvements while maintaining high segmentation and boundary scores compared with the current state-of-the-art.

High-quality models for this task require a vast amount of images, and manual annotation is a process that is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Consequently, this has catalyzed the emergence of semi-supervised semantic segmentation methods. However, the complexity of foreground categories in remote sensing images poses a challenge to maintaining prediction consistency. Moreover, inherent characteristics such as intraclass variations and interclass similarities result in a certain degree of confusion among features of different classes in the feature space. This impacts the final classification results. To improve the model's consistency and optimize the classification of categories based on features, this article proposes a new semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework that combines consistency regularization and contrastive learning (CL). In terms of consistency regularization, the proposed method incorporates dual-teacher networks, introduces ClassMix for image augmentation, and uses confidence levels to integrate the predictions from these networks. By introducing perturbations at both the network and image levels, while simultaneously maintaining consistency, the predictive prowess and generalization ability of the model are enhanced. For CL, positive-unlabeled learning (PU-Learning) is used to improve the problem of mis-sampling when selecting features. At the same time, higher biased weights are allocated to more challenging negative samples, thereby elevating the complexity of feature learning and enhancing the discriminative capability of the final feature representation space.

Multimodal segmentation inevitably encounters the challenge of modeling intra-and inter-modal relationships, i.e., object diversity and modal gaps. However, the previous methods are usually designed for a single RS modality, limited by the noisy collection environment and poor discrimination information. Neuropsychology and neuroanatomy confirm that the human brain performs the guiding perception and integrative cognition of multimodal semantics through intuitive reasoning. Therefore, establishing a semantic understanding framework inspired by intuition to realize multimodal RS segmentation becomes the main motivation of this work.

These issues make existing learning algorithms suboptimal. In this work, we solve the abovementioned problems by proposing a high-resolution remote sensing network (Hi-ResNet) with efficient network structure designs, which consists of a funnel module, a multibranch module with stacks of information aggregation (IA) blocks, and a feature refinement module, sequentially, and class-agnostic edge-aware (CEA) loss.

Furthermore, with the design of the window multihead self-attention, squeeze-and-excitation attention, and depthwise convolution, the light-efficient IA blocks are utilized to distinguish image features of the same class with variant scales and shapes.

The SCANet consists of a Poolformer encoder and a Separable Channel Attention Feature Pyramid Network (SCA-FPN) decoder. Firstly, the Poolformer can extract global semantic information at different levels with the help of transformer architecture, and it greatly reduces computational complexity of the network by using pooling operations instead of a self-attention mechanism. Secondly, the SCA-FPN we designed can fuse multi-scale semantic information and complete pixel-level prediction of remote sensing images.

Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made great progress in accomplishing this task recently, there still exist some challenges to address, one of which is simultaneously segmenting objects with large-scale variations in a HRSI. Targeting at this challenge, previous CNNs often adopt multiple convolution kernels in one layer or skip-layer connections between different layers to extract multiscale representations. However, due to the limited learning capacity of each CNN, it tends to make tradeoffs in segmenting different-scale objects. This would lead to unsatisfactory segmentation results for some objects, especially the small or the large ones. In this article, we propose a multiscale progressive segmentation network to address this issue. Instead of forcing one network to deal with all scales of objects, our network attempts to cascade three subnetworks for gradually segmenting objects into small scale, large scale, and other scale. In order to make the subnetwork focus on the specific scale objects, a scale guidance module is designed. It takes advantage of segmentation results from the preceding subnetwork to guide the feature learning of the succeeding one.

Recent solutions in crop segmentation are mainly deep-learning-based methods, including two mainstream architectures: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer. However, these two architectures are not sufficiently good for the crop segmentation task due to the following three reasons. First, the ultra-high-resolution images need to be cut into small patches before processing, which leads to the incomplete structure of different categories' edges. Second, because of the deficiency of global information, categories inside the crop field may be wrongly classified. Third, to restore complete images, the patches need to be spliced together, causing the edge artifacts and small misclassified objects and holes. Therefore, we proposed a novel architecture named the Coupled CNN and Transformer Network (CCTNet), which combines the local details (e.g., edge and texture) by the CNN and global context by Transformer to cope with the aforementioned problems.

To solve this problem, this paper proposes an object-based Markov random field method with partition-global alternately updated (OMRF-PGAU). First, four partition images are constructed based on the original image, they overlap with each other and can be reconstructed into the original image; the number of categories and region granularity for these partition images are set. Then, the MRF model is built on the partition images and the original image, their segmentations are alternately updated. The update path adopts a circular path, and the correlation assumption is adopted to establish the connection between the label fields of partition images and the original image. Finally, the relationship between each label field is constantly updated, and the final segmentation result is output after the segmentation has converged.

The ancient city walls have considerable study value because they served as the city's boundary and a symbol of power. However, as a result of natural erosion and human activities, many sites have been ruined. Existing optical remote sensing technologies, LiDAR point cloud processing algorithms, and deep learning methods are inadequate for the extraction and segmentation of ancient city wall sites. The novel semantic segmentation method for ancient city wall sites is described in this paper that extracts sites at the pixel level from LiDAR remote sensing data based on deep learning. To begin, the point cloud data collected by airborne laser scanning is processed into DEM data, and the distribution of ancient city walls in the study area is obtained through archaeological survey and expert interpretation. The dataset for deep learning semantic segmentation is then generated using image cropping and data augmentation techniques. Third, implement a U-Net semantic segmentation framework for microtopographic archaeological sites, and predict ancient city wall sites in the testing region after model training. Finally, the deep learning results are optimized using the connected component analysis method, and prediction mistakes such as holes and noise are removed. Taking Jinancheng, the capital city of the Chu kingdom, as an example, the proposed method process can identify and extract the ancient city wall sites at the pixel level, where the evaluation metrics reach 94.12% (Precision) and 81.38% (IoU). The experiment results are excellent due to improvement strategies in the dataset generation, model training, and post-processing steps.

We explore a new way of introducing the multiview 3-D structure priors to the task for accurate and view-consistent semantic segmentation. The proposed method includes a two-stage learning process. In the first stage, we optimize a neural field to encode the color and 3-D structure of the RS scene based on multiview images. In the second stage, we design a ray transformer to leverage the relations between the neural field 3-D features and 2-D texture features for learning better semantic representations. Different from previous methods that only consider 3-D priors or 2-D features, we incorporate additional 2-D texture information and 3-D priors by broadcasting CNN features to different point features along the sampled ray. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we construct a challenging dataset containing six synthetic sub-datasets collected from the Carla platform and three real sub-datasets from Google Maps.

Although this technique is widely studied in the field of computer vision, there are few methods for remote-sensing images. Prevalent FSS methods can achieve remarkable results for natural images, but they are difficult to apply to remote-sensing image processing because existing methods rarely take into consideration the large-scale and resolution differences in remote-sensing images. Consequently, it is hard for them to obtain correct semantic guidance from a few annotated remote-sensing images. To tackle these problems, this article proposes the pyramid correlation fusion network (PCFNet) to promote the ability to mine helpful information by calculating multiscale pixel-wise semantic correspondence. Particularly, the dual-distance correlation (DDC) module is designed to simultaneously compute the cosine similarity and Euclidean distance between query features and support features, producing adequate guidance information to determine the category of each pixel. Moreover, to improve segmentation accuracy for small objects, the scale-aware cross-entropy loss (SACELoss) is introduced to dynamically assign loss weights according to the actual sizes of objects. This enables smaller objects to be assigned larger weight values and thus receive more attention during training.

However, previous deep learning-based road extraction methods primarily used RGB imagery as an input and did not take advantage of the spectral information contained in hyperspectral imagery. These methods can produce discontinuous outputs caused by objects with similar spectral signatures to roads. In addition, the images obtained from different Earth remote sensing sensors may have different spatial resolutions, enhancing the difficulty of the joint analysis. This work proposes the Multiscale Fusion Attention Network (MSFANet) to overcome these problems. Compared to traditional road extraction frameworks, the proposed MSFANet fuses information from different spectra at multiple scales. In MSFANet, multispectral remote sensing data is used as an additional input to the network, in addition to RGB remote sensing data, to obtain richer spectral information. The Cross-source Feature Fusion Module (CFFM) is used to calibrate and fuse spectral features at different scales, reducing the impact of noise and redundant features from different inputs. The Multiscale Semantic Aggregation Decoder (MSAD) fuses multiscale features and global context information from the upsampling process layer by layer, reducing information loss during the multiscale feature fusion.

Firstly, the image style conversion is used to reduce the domain offset of the image level, and the dual-path method is used to promote each other to improve the image conversion quality and the pseudo-label quality of the target domain. Secondly, the pseudo-tags of the first-stage training are used to prioritize, and the target domain is divided into easy and difficult to partition for selective retraining. By adversarial learning, the difficult-to-segment features are aligned with easily-segmented features, and the influence of domain migration is gradually reduced by adaptive repetition in the domain, thus improving the segmentation performance of the network.",Unsupervised domain adaptive,Semantic segmentation of remote sensing images,Dual path image conversion,self-training,Adversarial learning,,,,,ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We propose a vector mapping method for buildings in remote sensing images with joint semantic-geometric learning to generate building polygon vectors in remote sensing images automatically. The method, aiming to provide cartography and GIS data sources, consists of three modules: multi-task segmentation, contour regularization, and polygon optimization. To reduce missing extractions and mis-extractions and obtain a complete building segmentation mask, the multitask segmentation module performs joint semantic-geometric learning on three related tasks: building instance detection, pixel-wise contour segmentation, and edge extraction. The regularization module normalizes the segmentation mask expression using geometric constraints and image information, whereas the polygon optimization module combines geometric constraints with deep learning methods to ensure vectorization quality. The experimental results show that the proposed method adapts well to building vector extraction tasks under different scenarios and can generate building vector polygons that match the ground truth labels.

The algorithm combines three main components: network, attention mechanism, and a noise-robust loss function. Three different noise rates (containing both symmetric and asymmetric noise) were simulated to test the noise resistance of the network. Validation was performed in the Vaihingen region of the ISPRS Vaihingen 2D semantic labeling dataset, and the performance of the network was evaluated by comparing the NRN-RSSEG with the original U-Net model. The results show that NRN-RSSEG maintains a high accuracy on both clean and noisy datasets. Specifically, NRN-RSSEG outperforms UNET in terms of PA, MPA, Kappa, Mean_F1, and FWIoU in the presence of noisy datasets, and as the noise rate increases, each performance of UNET shows a decreasing trend while the performance of NRN-RSSEG decreases slowly and some performances show an increasing trend.

To address these issues, a deep metametric learning framework, named DMML-Net, consisting of the metametric learner and the base-metric learner, is proposed for few-shot geographic object segmentation.

In addition, the semantic segmentation methods based on DCNNs mostly obtain context information using extra information within the added receptive field.

However, in previous studies, the long-range dependency, modeled with an attention mechanism or transformer model, has been based on unsupervised learning, instead of explicit supervision from the objective ground truth (GT). In this article, we propose a novel supervised long-range correlation method for land-cover classification, called the supervised long-range correlation network (SLCNet), which is shown to be superior to the currently used unsupervised strategies. In SLCNet, pixels sharing the same category are considered highly correlated and those having different categories are less relevant, which can be easily supervised by the category consistency information available in the GT semantic segmentation map. Under such supervision, the recalibrated features are more consistent for pixels of the same category and more discriminative for pixels of other categories, regardless of their proximity. To complement the detailed information lacking in the global long-range correlation, we introduce an auxiliary adaptive receptive field feature extraction (ARFE) module, parallel to the long-range correlation module in the encoder, to capture finely detailed feature representations for multisize objects in multiscale remote sensing images. In addition, we apply multiscale side-output supervision and a hybrid loss function as local and global constraints to further boost the segmentation accuracy.

Solving this problem is crucial for improving segmentation accuracy. Traditional image-domain segmentation methods rely on color and texture features, but spectrally similar objects have negligible color differences, leading to suboptimal segmentation results. To address this, we propose a network framework called Correlated Mapping Attention Cooperative Network (CMACNet) by extending the problem from the image domain to the feature domain. Image-domain methods depend on color and texture features, whereas feature-domain methods process higher-level abstract features, avoiding issues caused by color similarity. Specifically, CMACNet first employs an autoencoder structure. The autoencoder compresses the input data and attempts to reconstruct the original data, ensuring that the latent space representations capture essential and representative features of the input data, thereby extracting highly generalized and versatile features. Next, we introduce the correlated mapping attention mechanism, which adaptively adjusts the attention to different features based on their correlations, effectively addressing the challenge of segmenting spectrally similar objects. Furthermore, to efficiently establish global relationships among features, we design a cross global interaction layer for global feature remapping. Comprehensive experiments on the Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets demonstrate that CMACNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving mean intersection over union scores of 84.77% and 87.69%, respectively.",Attention mechanism,global modeling,remote sensing (RS),semantic segmentation,transformer,,,,,IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING,,Attention mechanism,global modeling,remote sensing (RS),semantic segmentation,transformer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The VHR RSI-based cross-domain segmentation mainly faces two critical challenges: 1) large area land covers with many diverse object categories bring severe local patch-level data distribution deviations, thus yielding different adaptation difficulties for different local patches and 2) different VHR sensor types or dynamically changing modes cause the VHR images to go through intensive data distribution differences even for the same geographical location, resulting in different global feature-level domain gaps. To address these challenges, we propose a curriculum-style local-to-global cross-domain adaptation framework for the segmentation of VHR RSIs. The proposed curriculum-style adaptation performs the adaptation process in an easy-to-hard way according to the adaptation difficulties that can be obtained using an entropy-based score for each patch of the target domain and, thus, well aligns the local patches in a domain image. The proposed local-to-global adaptation performs the feature alignment process from the locally semantic to globally structural feature discrepancies and consists of a semantic-level domain classifier and an entropy-level domain classifier that can reduce the above cross-domain feature discrepancies.

However, large variations in the scales of objects in those VHR images pose a challenge for performing accurate semantic segmentation. Existing semantic segmentation networks are able to analyze an input image at up to four resizing scales, but this may be insufficient given the diversity of object scales. Therefore, multiscale (MS) test-time data augmentation is often used in practice to obtain more accurate segmentation results, which makes equal use of the segmentation results obtained at the different resizing scales. However, it was found in this study that different classes of objects had their preferred resizing scale for more accurate semantic segmentation.

Semantic segmentation of remotely sensed multi- or hyperspectral images through deep learning (DL) artificial neural networks (ANN) delivers as output the corresponding matrix of pixels classified elementwise, achieving competitive performance metrics. With technological progress, current remote sensing (RS) sensors have more spectral bands and higher spatial resolution than before, which means a greater number of pixels in the same area. Nevertheless, the more spectral bands and the greater number of pixels, the higher the computational complexity and the longer the processing times. Therefore, without dimensionality reduction, the classification task is challenging, particularly if large areas have to be processed. To solve this problem, our approach maps an RS-image or third-order tensor into a core tensor, representative of our input image, with the same spatial domain but with a lower number of new tensor bands using a Tucker decomposition (TKD). Then, a new input space with reduced dimensionality is built. To find the core tensor, the higher-order orthogonal iteration (HOOI) algorithm is used.

However, most domain-adaptation algorithms only tried to align the source domain and the target domain in the pixel level or the representation level, while ignored their cooperation. In this letter, we propose an unsupervised domain-adaptation method by Joint Pixel and Representation level Network (JPRNet) alignment.

JPRNet is composed of two branches, each of which is a generative-adversarial network (GAN). In one branch, pixel-level domain adaptation is implemented by the style transfer with the Cycle GAN, which could transfer the source domain to a target domain. In the other branch, the representation-level domain adaptation is realized by adversarial learning between the transferred source-domain images and the target-domain images.

In remote sensing images, the presence of complex noise information at the lake boundary hinders the normal expression of boundary information, which leads to methods cannot extract a coherent lake boundary. Moreover, partial small-scale lakes' texture features are weak and easily masked by the background information. To address the above issues, an end-to-end semantic segmentation network is designed. The network uses a symmetric encoder-decoder architecture to extract lake water in remote sensing images. On the one hand, a directional noise reduction filtering algorithm is proposed to reduce the impact of noise information on the network segmentation process. The algorithm utilizes a preset directional guide map to guide the nonlinear propagation of boundary noise and suppress low-contrast halo artifacts in the image, thereby better preserving the boundary sharpness of the lake. On the other hand, for the problem of missing small-scale lakes, an attention gate compression module is embedded in the skip connection. This module can adaptively integrate the correlation features between different ground objects, and selectively assign more attention to small-scale lakes, thereby improving the network's ability to recognize such lakes.

Choosing the appropriate segmentation scales for distinct ground objects and intelligently combining them together are two crucial issues to get the appropriate segmentation result for target applications. With respect to these two issues, this paper proposes a simple scale-synthesis method which is highly flexible to be adjusted to meet the segmentation requirements of varying image-analysis tasks. The main idea of this method is to first divide the whole image area into multiple regions; each region consisted of ground objects that have similar optimal segmentation scale. Then, synthesize the suboptimal segmentations of each region to get the final segmentation result. The result is the combination of suboptimal scales of objects and is therefore more coherent to ground objects. To validate this method, the land-cover-category map is used to guide the scale synthesis of multiscale image segmentations for the Quickbird-image land-use classification. First, the image is coarsely divided into multiple regions; each region belongs to a certain land-cover category. Then, multiscale-segmentation results are generated by the Mumford-Shah function based region-merging method. For each land-cover category, the optimal segmentation scale is selected by the supervised segmentation-accuracy-assessment method. Finally, the optimal scales of segmentation results are synthesized under the guide of land-cover category. It is proved that the proposed scale-synthesis method can generate a more accurate segmentation result that benefits the latter classification.

This issue is particularly prevalent in remote sensing imagery, where a semantic segmentation model trained on images from one satellite is tested on images from another. Previous research has often overlooked the role of data augmentation in enhancing a model's adaptability to target domains. In contrast, this article proposes a novel self-training framework that incorporates data augmentation at both the input and feature levels, yielding excellent results. Specifically, we introduce a regularized online self-training framework that effectively addresses the challenges of overconfidence and class imbalance inherent in self-training. Based on this framework, we implement two robust data augmentation strategies at the input and feature levels to facilitate the learning of cross-domain invariant knowledge. At the input level, we employ a large-scale domain mixing strategy, termed multidomain mixing, to enhance the model's generalization capability. At the feature level, we introduce masked feature augmentation, a masking-based perturbation technique applied to the semantic features of the target domain. This approach enhances the consistency of teacher-student network predictions in the target domain feature space, thereby improving the robustness of the model's recognition of target domain features. The integration of the proposed self-training framework with dual-level data augmentation culminates in our innovative self-training-based dual-level data augmentation (STDA) method.

This leads to a greater challenge in domain adaptation, called heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA). To address this issue, we propose a novel method called transfer diffusion (Trans-Diff), which is the first work to explore the diffusion model for HDA remote sensing segmentation. The proposed Trans-Diff constructs cross-domain unified prompts for the diffusion model. This approach enables the generation of images from different modalities with specific semantics, leading to efficient HDA segmentation.

In addition, we design an adaptive sampling strategy to dynamically regulate the generated images' stylistic consistency and semantic consistency. This can effectively reduce the cross-domain discrepancies between different modalities of RSIs, ultimately significantly improving the HDA remote sensing segmentation performance.

Consequently, the complementarity between multimodal features cannot be exploited, and excess noise is introduced during feature processing. To solve these problems, we propose a multimodal fusion module to explore the similarities and differences between features from the two information modalities for adequate fusion.

Specifically, the low-level features extracted from the shallow layer and the abstract features extracted from the deep layer cannot be completely merged, resulting in inaccurate segmentation. In response to this problem, we design a new multiscale feature extraction module that extracts target information through three convolution kernels of different scales.

However, this assumption is not always satisfied in practical situations of land cover semantic segmentation when models trained in a particular source domain are applied to other regions. This is because domain shifts caused by variations in location, time, and sensor alter the distribution of images in the target domain from that of the source domain, resulting in significant degradation of model performance. To mitigate this limitation, domain generalization (DG) has gained attention as a way of generalizing from source domain features to unseen target domains. One approach is style randomization (SR), which enables models to learn domain-invariant features through randomizing styles of images in the source domain. Despite its potential, existing methods face several challenges, such as inflexible frequency decomposition, high computational and data preparation demands, slow speed of randomization, and lack of consistency in learning. To address these limitations, we propose a frequency-based optimal style mix (FOSMix), which consists of three components: 1) full mix (FM) enhances the data space by maximally mixing the style of reference images into the source domain; 2) optimal mix (OM) keeps the essential frequencies for segmentation and randomizes others to promote generalization; and 3) regularization of consistency ensures that the model can stably learn different images with the same semantics.

In the past few years, methods using transformer have attracted increasing attention and generate improved results in semantic segmentation of natural images, owing to their powerful ability in global information acquisition. Nevertheless, these transformer-based methods exhibit limited performance in semantic segmentation of RS images, probably because of the lack of comprehensive understanding in the feature decoding process. In this paper, a novel transformer-based model named the bi-decoder transformer segmentor for remote sensing (BiTSRS) is proposed, aiming at alleviating the problem of flexible feature decoding, through a bi-decoder design for semantic segmentation of RS images. In the proposed BiTSRS, the Swin transformer is adopted as encoder to take both global and local representations into consideration, and a unique design module (ITM) is designed to deal with the limitation of input size for Swin transformer. Furthermore, BiTSRS adopts a bi-decoder structure consisting of a Dilated-Uper decoder and a fully deformable convolutional network (FDCN) module embedded with focal loss, with which it is capable of decoding a wide range of features and local detail deformations. Both ablation experiments and comparison experiments were conducted on three representative RS images datasets.

Unfortunately, due to the high acquisition costs and infrequent availability of high-resolution imagery, low-resolution images are more practical for large-scale mapping or change tracking of buildings. However, extracting buildings from low-resolution images is a challenging task. Compared with high-resolution images, low-resolution images pose two critical challenges in terms of building segmentation: the effects of fuzzy boundary details on buildings and the lack of local textures. In this study, we propose a sparse geometric feature attention network (SGFANet) based on multi-level feature fusion to address the aforementioned issues. From the perspective of the fuzzy effect, SGFANet enhances the representative boundary features by calculating the point-wise affinity of the selected feature points in a top-down manner.

This mechanism employs a bias-free data augmentation strategy, fostering consistent bidirectional predictions in teacher-student networks, thereby enhancing domain generalization and feature robustness. Our multiscale context-enhanced prediction module further amplifies this. In the ST stage, we propose a dynamic threshold-free pseudolabel learning strategy that utilizes well-aligned feature prototypes in the feature space to guide pseudolabel generation in the probability space, eliminating the threshold constraints. In addition, we model uncertainty using relative entropy and incorporate it into the optimization objective to manage high-confidence noise.

However, existing methods cannot fully consider these problems, limiting the performance of UDA semantic segmentation of RSIs. To this end, this article proposes a novel cross-domain multiprototypes learning method, the core idea of which is to abstract the cross-domain and intradomain class-level relations into multiple prototypes.

However, when studying buildings and water bodies through high-resolution remote sensing images, water bodies are very easy to be confused with the spectra of dark objects such as building shadows, asphalt roads and dense vegetation. The existing semantic segmentation methods do not pay enough attention to the local feature information between horizontal direction and position, which leads to the problem of misjudgment of buildings and loss of local information of water area. In order to improve this problem, this paper proposes a local feature search network (DFSNet) application in remote sensing image building and water segmentation.

However, previous methods mostly adopt 3-D elevation information as additional inputs, while, in many real-world applications, one does not have the corresponding DSM images at hand, and the spatial resolution of acquired DSM images usually does not match the aerial images. To alleviate this data constraint and also take advantage of 3-D elevation information, in this letter, a geometry-aware segmentation model is introduced to achieve accurate semantic labeling of aerial images via joint height estimation. Instead of using a single-stream encoder-decoder network for semantic labeling, we design a separate decoder branch to predict the height map and use the DSM images as side supervision to train this newly designed decoder branch. With the newly designed decoder branch, our model can distill the 3-D geometric features from 2-D appearance features under the supervision of ground-truth DSM images. Moreover, we develop a new geometry-aware convolution module that fuses the 3-D geometric features from the height decoder branch and the 2-D contextual features from the semantic segmentation branch. The fused feature embeddings can produce geometry-aware segmentation maps with enhanced performance. Our model is trained with DSM images as side supervision, while, in the inference stage, it does not require DSM data and directly predicts the semantic labels.

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing segmentation plays a crucial role in early identifying and preventing PWD. However, deep learning segmentation models customized for PWD identification in scenarios with complex backgrounds have not received extensive exploration. In this article, we propose a novel UAV remote sensing segmentation model called Clusterformer with a conventional encoder-decoder structure. The encoder is comprised of the specially designed cluster transformer, which includes a cluster token mixer and a spatial-channel feed-forward network (SC-FFN). The cluster token mixer utilizes constructed clusters from the feature maps to represent pixels, thereby reducing redundant and interfering information. The SC-FFN extracts multiscale spatial information through depth-wise convolutions and channel information through a multilayer perceptron (MLP) in sequence. The decoder primarily consists of the specially designed D-cluster transformer. The token mixer of the D-cluster transformer employs constructed clusters from high-level decoded tokens to represent low-level encoded tokens without relying on traditional upsampling methods such as interpolation, transpose convolution, or patch expansion. Consequently, more robust and less redundant features from high-level decoded feature maps are transferred to low-level encoded feature maps. Experimental results on two PWD datasets demonstrate that Clusterformer outperforms existing state-of-the-art segmentation models. This confirms the effectiveness and efficiency of Clusterformer in PWD identification.

However, detecting old landslides from high-resolution remote sensing images (HRSIs) is of great challenge due to their partially or strongly transformed morphology over a long time and thus the limited difference with their surroundings. Additionally, small-sized datasets can restrict in-depth learning. To address these challenges, this article proposes a new iterative classification and semantic segmentation network (ICSSN), which can significantly improve both object-level and pixel-level classification performance by iteratively upgrading the feature extraction module shared by the object classification and semantic segmentation networks. To improve the detection performance on small-sized datasets, object-level contrastive learning is employed in the object classification network featuring a siamese network to realize global features extraction, and a subobject-level contrastive learning (SOCL) method is designed in the semantic segmentation network to efficiently extract salient features from boundaries of landslides. An iterative training strategy is also proposed to fuse features in the semantic space, further improving both the object-level and pixel-level classification performances. The proposed ICSSN is evaluated on a real-world landslide dataset, and experimental results show that it greatly improves both the classification and segmentation accuracy of old landslides. For the semantic segmentation task, compared to the baseline, the F1 score increases from 0.5054 to 0.5448, the mean intersection over union (mIoU) improves from 0.6405 to 0.6610, the landslide IoU grows from 0.3381 to 0.3743, the pixel accuracy (PA) is improved from 0.945 to 0.949, and the object-level detection accuracy of old landslides surges from 0.55 to 0.90.

However, the high-frequency detail loss caused by continuous convolution and pooling operations and the uncertainty introduced when annotating low-contrast objects with weak boundaries induce blurred object boundaries. Therefore, a dual-stream network MAE-BG, consisting of an edge detection (ED) branch and a smooth branch with boundary guidance (BG), is proposed. The ED branch is designed to enhance the weak edges that need to be preserved, simultaneously suppressing false responses caused by local texture. This mechanism is achieved by introducing improved multiple-attention edge detection blocks (MAE). Furthermore, two specific ED branches with MAE are designed to combine with typical deep convolutional (DC) and Codec infrastructures and result in two configurations of MAE-A and MAE-B. Meanwhile, multiscale edge information extracted by MAE networks is fed into the backbone networks to complement the detail loss caused by convolution and pooling operations. This results in smooth networks with BG. After that, the segmentation results with improved boundaries are obtained by stacking the output of the ED and smooth branches.

Higher resolutions may be more suitable for accurately detecting objects, but they also come with higher costs and require more computing power. Semantic segmentation is a common task in remote sensing where GSD plays a crucial role. In semantic segmentation, each pixel of an image is classified into a predefined set of classes, resulting in a semantic segmentation map. However, comparing the results of semantic segmentation at different GSDs is not straightforward. Unlike scene classification and object detection tasks, which are evaluated at scene and object level, respectively, semantic segmentation is typically evaluated at pixel level. This makes it difficult to match elements across different GSDs, resulting in a range of methods for computing metrics, some of which may not be adequate. For this reason, the purpose of this work is to set out a clear set of guidelines for fairly comparing semantic segmentation results obtained at various spatial resolutions. Additionally, we propose to complement the commonly used scene-based pixel-wise metrics with region-based pixel-wise metrics, allowing for a more detailed analysis of the model performance. The set of guidelines together with the proposed region-based metrics are illustrated with building and swimming pool detection problems.

Unsupervised domain adaptation (DA) techniques aim to transfer knowledge learned from the source domain to a totally unlabeled target domain. By reducing the domain shift, DA methods have shown the ability to improve the classification accuracy for the target domain. Hence, in this letter, we propose an unsupervised adversarial DA network that converts deep features into 2-D feature curves and reduces the discrepancy between curves from the source domain and curves from the target domain based on a conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) model. Our proposed DA network is able to improve the semantic labeling accuracy when we apply a pretrained semantic segmentation model to the target domain.

Thirdly, for each pixel, eight neighboring pixels with the same value of the pixel were calculated. If the value was 1, then the pixel was identified as the endpoint. Fourth, according to the number of endpoints within a buffered range, each pixel in the prediction image was given a corresponding weight. Finally, the weighted average value of the cross-entropy of all the pixels in the batch was used as the final loss function value. We employed four well-known semantic segmentation networks to conduct comparative experiments on three large datasets.

However, SAM exhibits three limitations related to remote sensing (RS) semantic segmentation task: 1) the image encoders excessively lose high-frequency information, such as object boundaries and textures, resulting in rough segmentation masks; 2) due to being trained on natural images, SAM faces difficulty in accurately recognizing objects with large-scale variations and uneven distribution in RS images; and 3) the output tokens used for mask prediction are trained on natural images and not applicable to RS image segmentation. In this article, we explore an efficient paradigm for applying SAM to the semantic segmentation of RS images. Furthermore, we propose multiscale enhanced SAM (MeSAM), a new SAM fine-tuning method more suitable for RS images to adapt it to semantic segmentation tasks. Our method first introduces an inception mixer into the image encoder to effectively preserve high-frequency features. Second, by designing a mask decoder with RS correction and incorporating multiscale connections, we make up the difference in SAM from natural images to RS images.

However, RS images present challenges beyond those encountered in generic WSSS, including complex backgrounds, densely distributed small objects, and considerable scale variations. To address the above issues, we introduce a consistency-constrained multiclass attention model, noted as CocoaNet. Specifically, CocoaNet endeavors to capture both semantic correlation and class distinctiveness using a global-local adaptive attention mechanism, which integrates the self-attention to model global correlation, complemented by a local perception branch that intensifies focus on local regions. The resulting class-specific attention weights and the patch-level pairwise affinity weights are employed to optimize the initial class activation maps (CAMs). This mechanism proves highly effective in mitigating interclass interference and managing the distribution of densely clustered small objects. Moreover, we invoke a consistency constraint to rectify activation inaccuracy. By utilizing a Siamese structure for the mutual supervision of features extracted from images at different scales, we address substantial scale variations in RS scenes. Simultaneously, a class contrast loss is adopted to enhance the discriminativeness of class-specific features. Departing from the conventional CAM optimization, which is rather complex and time-consuming, we harness the prior knowledge from the generic segment anything model (SAM) to design a joint optimization strategy (JOS) that refines target boundaries and further promotes discriminative visual features.

Domain adaptation (DA) consequently comes into being, which aims to learn the predictor for the label-scarce target domain of interest with the help of the label-sufficient source domain in the presence of the distribution difference, namely, domain shift, between the two domains. However, the off-the-shelf DA methods for image segmentation not only struggle to cope with the more complex domain shift problems in remote sensing imagery but also almost cannot process heterogeneous data directly without information loss.

However, this prerequisite often proves infeasible in real-world scenarios, particularly with the labeling complexities inherent in remote sensing images. In this manuscript, a semi-supervised approach has been investigated towards semantic segmentation of remotely sensed images by addressing the challenge of limited availability of ground-truth information. For this purpose, a hybrid integration of a standard semantic segmentation model and an adversarial model has been proposed under semi-supervised setting. The former predict the masks for the unlabelled images when fine-tuned with the available labelled training images (however limited they may be); whereas the latter aids the reconstruction of original input images from the predicted soft(masks) through an adversarial mechanism. This reconstruction, further validated through a reconstruction score, assist in the identification of 'most-confident' image-mask pairs to be strategically integrated into the training set. The contribution ultimately is to utilise the unannotated images to meaningfully augment the limited training set to obtain an enhanced one. The proposed technique showcases a significant improvement, with an 11-34% enhancement over existing approaches in terms of mean intersection over union, precision, and F1-score across both the minifrance and dense labeling remote sensing dataset datasets.",Semantic segmentation,Semi-supervision,Adversarial learning,Aerial imagery,Limited ground-truth,,,,,SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in high spatial resolution remote sensing image (RSI), the same category from different domains (e.g., urban and rural) can appear to be totally different with extremely inconsistent distributions, which heavily limits the UDA accuracy. To address this problem, in this article, we propose a novel deep covariance alignment (DCA) model for UDA RSI segmentation. The DCA can explicitly align category features to learn shared domain-invariant discriminative feature representations, which enhance the ability of model generalization. Specifically, a category feature pooling (CFP) module is first used to extract category features by combining coarse outputs and deep features. Then, we leverage a novel covariance regularization (CR) to enforce the intracategory features to be closer and the intercategory features to be further separate. Compared with the existing category alignment methods, our CR aims to regularize the correlation between different dimensions of the features, and thus performs more robustly when dealing with divergent category features of imbalanced and inconsistent distributions. Finally, we propose a stagewise procedure to train the DCA to alleviate error accumulation. Experiments on both rural-to-urban and urban-to-rural scenarios of the LoveDA dataset demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DCA over other state-of-the-art UDA segmentation methods.

Learning rotation-invariant features is critical in modeling a fixed descriptor for instances with its rotated variants. However, most existing methods construct the descriptor from the perspectives of data or feature augmentation, but ignore the exploration of potentially useful supervision information inside the detection algorithm. In this article, we propose an object-wise rotation-invariant semantic representation (ORSR) framework, which synergizes the exploration of latent supervision, rotation-invariant learning, and guided attention mechanism into a unified network to boost the performance of OOD in RSIs. First, supervised by our constructed pseudo-ground truth of segmentation masks, a semantic segmentation branch is built along with the detection algorithm to refine the representation of backbone features. Moreover, a consistency loss function is proposed to encourage the segmentation branch to make fixed predictions for backbone features with its rotated variants. Considering that segmentation predictions remain the same affine transformations before and after rotating, we further construct a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based similarity loss function to encourage the network to model the rotation-invariant features. Finally, we separate the ""object"" descriptor from the segmentation predictions to extend the implicit constraint in our proposed semantic segmentation branch. The separated ""object"" descriptor not only involves the spatial regularizer to emphasize the high-responsive regions in the image but also can be guided by the constructed consistency loss function.

The huge number of pixels poses a challenge to the semantic segmentation algorithm, which is limited by the storage of GPUs, so the current methods for processing HR RSIs are categorized into two main categories, i.e., global methods and local methods. The former downsamples the original image and loses a lot of feature details. The latter crops the original image and fails to obtain global contextual information. Both types of methods lead to limited segmentation accuracy. In this article, we propose an end-to-end framework, called global injection network (GINet), which explores two levels of feature distribution and feature relationship to achieve tradeoff between global context and local details.

Specifically, to alleviate domain shift generated by different sensors, both the source and target domains are projected into a colorspace with normalized distribution through an elaborate colorspace mapping unified module (CMUM). The color distributions of these two domains tend to be more uniform. Furthermore, in the target domain, the multistatistics joint evaluation module (MJEM) is proposed to capture different statistical characteristics of subscenarios for selecting plain scenarios regarded as high-confidence segmentation results to assist the further improvement of segmentation performance. In addition, a pyramid perceptual attention module (PPAM) containing omnidirectional features without computational burdens is added to our network for effectively enhancing the multiscale feature capture ability. In the cross-city DA experiments based on the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) and aerial benchmarks, the superiority of our algorithm is significantly demonstrated. Furthermore, we release a large-scale Martian terrain dataset noted as ""Mars-Seg"" containing 5 K images with pixel-level accurate annotations regarding issues, such as the lack of semantic segmentation datasets for unknown scenes.",Image segmentation,Semantics,Feature extraction,Training,Complexity theory,"Hu, Yinlin","Du, Qian",,,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING,,Adaptive systems,Generative adversarial networks,Covariate shift alleviation,semantic segmentation,stepwise,unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An increasing number of different sensor platforms are appearing in remote sensing, each of which can provide corresponding multimodal supplemental or enhanced information, such as optical images, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds, infrared images, or inertial measurement unit (IMU) data. However, these current deep networks for LiDAR and VHR images have not fully utilized the complete potential of multimodal data. The stacked multimodal fusion network (MFNet) ignores the structural differences between the modalities and the manual statistical characteristics within the modalities. For multimodal remote sensing data and its corresponding carefully designed handcrafted features, we designed a novel deep MFNet that can use multimodal VHR aerial images and LiDAR data and the corresponding intramodal features, such as LiDAR-derived features [slope and normalized digital surface model (NDSM)] and imagery-derived features [infrared-red-green (IRRG), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and difference of Gaussian (DoG)]. Technically, we introduce the attention mechanism and multimodal learning to adaptively fuse intermodal and intramodal features. Specifically, we designed a multimodal fusion mechanism, pyramid dilation blocks, and a multilevel feature fusion module. Through these modules, our network realized the adaptive fusion of multimodal features, improved the receptive field, and enhanced the global-to-local contextual fusion effect. Moreover, we used a multiscale supervision training scheme to optimize the network. Extensive experimental results and ablation studies on the ISPRS semantic dataset and IEEE GRSS DFC Zeebrugge dataset show the effectiveness of our proposed MFNet.",Semantics,Image segmentation,Laser radar,Sensors,Task analysis,"Zhang, Shengyuan",,,,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING,,Sun,Feature extraction,Aerial images,attention mechanism,convolutional neural network (CNN),multimodal fusion,semantic labeling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
