Global mapping and monitoring of human-dominated land use extent via satellites provides an empirical basis for assessing land use pressures. Here, we present a novel 2019 global land cover, land use, and ecozone map derived from Landsat satellite imagery and topographical data using derived image feature spaces and algorithms suited per theme. From the map, we estimate the spatial extent and dispersion of land use disaggregated by climate domain and ecozone, where dispersion is the mean distance of land use to all land within a subregion. We find that percent of area under land use and distance to land use follow a power law that depicts an increasingly random spatial distribution of land use as it extends across lands of comparable development potential. For highly developed climate/ecozones, such as temperate and sub-tropical terra firma vegetation on low slopes, area under land use is contiguous and remnant natural land cover have low areal extent and high fragmentation. The tropics generally have the greatest potential for land use expansion, particularly in South America. An exception is Asian humid tropical terra firma vegetated lowland, which has land use intensities comparable to that of temperate breadbaskets such as the United States' corn belt. Wetland extent is inversely proportional to land use extent within climate domains, indicating historical wetland loss for temperate, sub-tropical, and dry tropical biomes. Results highlight the need for planning efforts to preserve natural systems and associated ecosystem services. The demonstrated methods will be implemented operationally in quantifying global land change, enabling a monitoring framework for systematic assessments of the appropriation and restoration of natural land cover.",land cover and land use,global change,remote sensing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The growing amount of available remote sensing images, especially the well archived Landsat images with 30 meters resolution, have been used to conduct supervised classification for land use and land cover maps. However, to achieve high classification accuracy, ground truth samples with fine quality and large quantity are required. Collecting ground truth samples is both time-consuming and expensive and sometimes even unviable when ground truth samples are needed for the past years. In this paper, we provided a way of using the GlobeLand30 (GLC30) 2000 and 2010 products as ground truth instead of manually labeling ground truth samples to produce land use and land cover maps for 2005 in our study area, Bangladesh country on Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform.

Here, we evaluate the comparative performance of alternative land cover classifications generated by using only (1) phenological metrics derived from either of two land surface phenology models, or (2) a suite of spectral band percentiles and normalized ratios (spectral variables), or (3) a combination of phenological metrics and spectral variables. First, several annual time series of remotely sensed data were assembled: Accumulated growing degree-days (AGDD) from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 8-day land surface temperature products, 2-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2), and the spectral variables from the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2, as well as from the U.S. Landsat Analysis Ready Data surface reflectance products. Then, at each pixel, EVI2 time series were fitted using two different land surface phenology models: The Convex Quadratic model (CxQ), in which EVI2 = f(AGDD) and the Hybrid Piecewise Logistic Model (HPLM), in which EVI2 = f(day of year). Phenometrics and spectral variables were submitted separately and together to Random Forest Classifiers (RFC) to depict land use/land cover in Roberts County, South Dakota. HPLM RFC models showed slightly better accuracy than CxQ RFC models (about 1% relative higher in overall accuracy). Compared to phenometrically-based RFC models, spectrally-based RFC models yielded more accurate land cover maps, especially for non-crop cover types. However, the RFC models built from spectral variables could not accurately classify the wheat class, which contained mostly spring wheat with some fields in durum or winter varieties. The most accurate RFC models were obtained when using both phenometrics and spectral variables as inputs. The combined-variable RFC models overcame weaknesses of both phenometrically-based classification (low accuracy for non-vegetated covers) and spectrally-based classification (low accuracy for wheat). The analysis of important variables indicated that land cover classification for this study area was strongly driven by variables related to the initial green-up phase of seasonal growth and maximum fitted EVI2. For a deeper evaluation of RFC performance, RFC classifications were also executed with several alternative sampling scenarios, including different spatiotemporal filters to improve accuracy of sample pools and different sample sizes. Results indicated that a sample pool with less filtering yielded the most accurate predicted land cover map and a stratified random sample dataset covering approximately 0.25% or more of the study area were required to achieve an accurate land cover map. In case of data scarcity, a smaller dataset might be acceptable, but should not smaller than 0.05% of the study area.",phenometrics,land use,land cover classification,,Landsat,Sentinel,ARD,HLS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to model design, related specifications are to be defined in the implementation. Yet, there are many severe obstacles against defining such specifications that are applicable to all cases. In this context, there are many different types of land use/cover classification systems for different purposes in different data quality, scale and content, which are either designed internationally or nationally. FAO Land Cover Classification System (LCCS), CORINE land cover, INSPIRE land use/cover themes, land use capability classification and Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) are common international examples.In this study, management of spatial land use/cover data in association with cadastral land parcels represented by LADM was studied in a pilot study area in Turkey. In this context, association of spatial information as sub-divisions of land parcels (sub-parcels) was studied. Different land use/cover data sets (four types) were specifically produced for this study with an LPIS like digitization method. For the association, special overlay operations with and without predefined XY tolerances were carried out. Effects of similar yet different data sets, spatial data consistency between the produced sub-parcel data sets and land parcels, and also errors were analyzed based on the results. It is found (1) that the level of detail (base production scale) of external land use/cover data set increases spatial association errors, (2) that using XY tolerances to reduce these errors causes data inconsistency and (3) that direct spatial harmonization of two data set may be a robust solution when it is possible. In this context, in order to contribute to the implementation of LADM in terms of spatial association of land parcels and external land use/cover data, together with these data processing and analysis work, LADM modelling abstraction, availability and data quality issues of external land use/cover data, updating and maintenance issues were also discussed.

As a consequence, there is a growing need for harmonization of data, not least in its classification descriptions. Unfortunately, inadequate metadata hampers understanding of how data sets are produced and what data classes represent. This study describes how five different categorical geodata sets for Denmark, ranging from habitat registrations through maps of agricultural land use to national topographic data, are integrated and how the integrated data set is reclassified to land-use and land-cover classes. All five data sets differ with respect to data acquisition, and description and classification methodologies, and none of the data distinguish between land use and land cover. The purpose of the reclassification was to produce maps of land use and land cover, with classes being compatible with the land cover classification system (LCCS) from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. We identified land-cover and land-use classes from the LCCS that matched Danish conditions and cross-tabulated those classes with classes from the integrated Danish data set. Based on the semantic meaning of the class names from the integrated data set, we used heuristic associational knowledge to estimate their membership in the land-use and land-cover classes. The results are three land-use maps and five land-cover maps, indicating qualitative estimates of the presence of land-cover classes measured on an ordinal scale.",land use,land cover,classification,,data harmonization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous global studies have focused on developing spatial and temporal patterns of dominant human land-use activities (e. g., cropland, pastureland, urban land, wood harvest). Process-based modeling studies adopt different strategies to estimate the changes in land cover by using these land-use data sets in combination with a potential vegetation map, and subsequently use this information for impact assessments. However, due to unaccounted changes in land cover (resulting from both indirect anthropogenic and natural causes), heterogeneity in land-use/cover (LUC) conversions among grid cells, even for the same land use activity, and uncertainty associated with potential vegetation mapping and historical estimates of human land use result in land cover estimates that are substantially different compared to results acquired from remote sensing observations. Here, we present a method to implicitly account for the differences arising from these uncertainties in order to provide historical estimates of land cover that are consistent with satellite estimates for recent years. Due to uncertainty in historical agricultural land use, we use three widely accepted global estimates of cropland and pastureland in combination with common wood harvest and urban land data sets to generate three distinct estimates of historical land-cover change and underlying LUC conversions. Hence, these distinct historical reconstructions offer a wide range of plausible regional estimates of uncertainty and the extent to which different ecosystems have undergone changes. The annual land cover maps and LUC conversion maps are reported at 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees resolution and describe the area of 28 land-cover types and respective underlying land-use transitions. The reconstructed data sets are relevant for studies addressing the impact of land-cover change on biogeophysics, biogeochemistry, water cycle, and global climate.",historical land use,land-cover change,land-use conversions,,deforestation,HYDE,Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This approach facilitates more reliable results. The authors analysed LUCC in northern Hungary (the Pest County) and southern Poland (the Malopolska Province) using GIS and statistical methods. The main aim of the research was to identify and assess the ongoing LUCC changes and compare them in the assumed field of research. The results indicate the existence of a trend in each time series. A downward trend was revealed for agricultural land in Hungary and Poland as well as for uncultivated land in Hungary. An upward trend was found in other variables (uncultivated land in Poland and forest land in both countries).

To produce LULC maps, supervised classification methods are often used. For many supervised classification algorithms, independence of features is an implied assumption. However, this assumption is rarely tested. For LULC classification, using all bands as input features to models is the default approach. However, some of the bands may be highly correlated, which may cause model performances unstable. In this research, correlations and multicollinearity among multi-spectral bands are analyzed for four major LULC types, i.e. cropland, forest, developed area and water bodies. Guided by the correlation analysis, different band combinations were used to train Support Vector Machines (SVM) for four-class LULC classification and the results were compared.

We find that the India got warmer by 0.1 degrees C per decade during 1981-2006 and the LULC changes contributed to cooling over India by 0.02 degrees C per decade during this period. The contribution of land use changes to the temperature trends depends on the type of LULC and their conversion from one type to another. With the exception of dense forest, all land cover conversions to agriculture lead to cooling whereas conversion from dense forest to agriculture results in warming. The contribution of LULC changes towards cooling over India during 1981-2006 is due to the reduction of area under shrubs/ small vegetation and subsequent increase of the area under agricultural/ fallow land. The analysis shows that even though the LULC changes contributed towards overall cooling during 1981-2006 over India, it contributed towards warming during 1991-2006. We find that the cooling caused by LULC changes during 1981-2006 is due to the cooling contributed during 1981-1990. Our overall results have implications for future land use change strategies that can be undertaken over India in order to avoid further worsening the Indian climate.",Regional warming,Land use and land cover change,Climate change,,Observation minus reanalysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The influences of soil, meteorological conditions, and national policy on LUCC in this region were also investigated. The results of land-use classification of five remote sensing images captured between 1980 and 2018 showed that Grassland was the dominant land-use type. The areas of Woodland and Built-up land in the study area continued to increase, whereas those of Water bodies and Unused land continued to decrease. The area of Cropland first increased and then decreased. The areas where LUCC was driven by natural factors and anthropogenic factors were 25,428 km(2) and 9,683 km(2), representing 27.92% and 10.63% of the total area, respectively. The area that experienced no LUCC was 55,950 km (2) (61.44% of the total area). These data showed that LUCC was driven by natural and anthropogenic factors, with anthropogenic factors dominant in driving changes in Cropland, Woodland, and Built-up land, whereas natural factors dominated reductions in the areas of Water bodies and Unused land. Although natural factors played an important role in LUCC, this study showed that anthropogenic factors determine the direction of LUCC.",Change trajectory,driving forces,land-use and land-cover change,,Mu Us Sandy Land,transition matrix,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data representing the surface, such as the land cover, are not perturbed. As fully data-driven forecasts without parameterisations are growing in importance, sampling the uncertainty on the land cover data brings a new way of making ensemble forecasts. Our work describes a method of generating ensemble land cover maps for numerical weather prediction. The target land cover map has the ECOCLIMAP-SG labels used in the SURFEX surface model and therefore is expected to have all relevant labels for surface-atmosphere interactions. The method translates the ESA WorldCover map to ECOCLIMAP-SG labels and resolution using auto-encoders. The land cover ensemble members are obtained by sampling the land cover probabilities in the output of the neural network. This paper builds upon the work done in a companion paper describing the high-resolution version of ECOCLIMAP-SG, called ECOCLIMAP-SG+, used for the training and evaluation of the neural network. The output map presented here, called ECOCLIMAP-SG-ML, improves upon the ECOCLIMAP-SG map in terms of resolution (from 300 m to 60 m), overall accuracy (from 0.41 to 0.63), and the ability to produce ensemble members.",land cover land use,machine learning,meteorology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, agricultural land and forest land are prevailing. Important spatial changes related to land use dynamic occurred in the 1990s (transition period) and got momentum after 2000. One of the major changes during the transition period was the expansion of private ownership over agricultural and forest land against the collective and state property that has been characteristic of the previous period. So, the large collective and state farms from the communist period gave way to small, peasant-type family farms, leading to noticeable fragmentation of the agricultural land. As to the land use pattern, two main directions of change have been of interest. Firstly, the intensification and the extensification of the agricultural systems, mostly in the plains and plateaux and secondly, the afforestation and deforestation, largely in the mountains and plateaux have been described. The pack of urbanisation and industrialisation slowed down, yet still on going in the large urban centres as Bucharest, Timisoara, Iasi, Constanta, Cluj Napoca etc., and in their neighbourhood.

In order to assess the potential impact on Canada's agricultural lands, we integrated land use and soil capability maps and land management information to introduce several scenarios of crop residue harvest rates and land use conversions. The implications for soil quality, as represented by soil cover, were assessed for each scenario. The results showed that average soil cover at the national scale would decrease by more than 1 day if 40% of annual crop residues (by mass) were harvested, but the negative impacts could be resolved by increased adoption of conservation tillage methods. Additional biomass could be produced by converting low quality agricultural land to perennial biomass crops, but this would result in increased intensity of food production on high quality land. The total area of high and low quality land within the agricultural region of Canada is roughly equal, and the amount of high quality land currently used for perennial crops is about the same as the amount of low quality land used for annual crops, and 'balancing' production with capability would result in a net increase in both food and biofuel feedstock, with little impact to soil quality. About 6.73 M ha of high quality land is covered by forest, shrub and grass, and conversion of this land to agricultural production would have a negative impact on soil quality. The study indicates considerable potential for production of both food and biofuel feedstock on Canada's agricultural lands through careful land use planning. Our analysis using soil cover as an indicator of environmental sustainability also indicates that land use planning should be cautious to prevent soil degradation. Particularly, regional variability of land use and soil capability distribution requires region specific land use policy for sustainable biofuel feedstock production.",Marginal land,Bioenergy,Crop residue,,Land use,Sustainable,Soil cover,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Malaria prevalence per village ranged from 5% to 20% with the overwhelming majority of cases being subclinical. Villages with high forest cover were associated with increased risk of malaria, even for villagers who did not report visits to forests. Villagers living near croplands experienced decreased malaria risk unless they were directly engaged in farm work. Finally, land cover change (specifically, natural forest loss) appeared to be a substantial contributor to malaria risk in the region, although this was not confirmed through sensitivity analyses.

The Temporal coverage of different Remote Sensing satellites provides information of Land use/Land cover of an particular area. Change detection is processing of identifying changes at different intervals of time. The amount of changes thus detected can help in predicting the impact on environment so that preventive measures can be taken when necessary.

Land use and land cover changes are identified as the prime issue in global environmental changes. Thus, it is necessary to initiate the land change detection process for land sustainability as well as to develop a competent land use planning. Tropical country like Malaysia has been experiencing land use and land cover changes rapidly for the past few decades. Thus, an attempt was made to detect the land use and land cover changes in the capital of the Selangor, Malaysia, Shah Alam over 20 years period (1990 - 2010). The study has been done through remote sensing approach using Earth Sat imagery of December 1990 and SPOT satellite imageries of March 2000 and December 2010. The current study resulted that the study area experienced land cover changes rapidly where the forest area occupied about 24.4% of Shah Alam in 1990 has decreased to 13.6% in 2010. Built up land have increased to 29.18% in 2010 from 12.47% in 1990. Other land cover classes such as wet land, wasteland and agricultural land also have undergone changes.

The aim of the study is to better understand the land cover/land-use relationship and to enhance the value of a land cover mapping product for the planning and management of natural resources and/or environmental change studies. In the case of the study, the land cover product is generated using the FAO/UNEP ""land cover classification system"". The methodology is heavily determined by the spatial resolution of the satellite imagery, the classification system used and the expert knowledge of the study area. For any given land cover the associated land-uses are identified as well as the land cover/land-use relationship. It is assumed that these relations can be of four types: one to one, one to many, many to one or a combination of any of the aforementioned possibilities. The land cover/land-use relation need not be consistent across the study area. The parameters used for land-use classification are based on a comprehensive review of the literature, in which land cover and land-use are usually amalgamated. A set of decision rules was established to define land-use classes. These decision rules were tested during the field survey, after which they were applied to the whole study area. The concurrence of land cover and land-use delineations is discussed for the classes identified. The result of the study is a detailed, flexible land-use data set in which the various parameters used for classification can be re-grouped according to user needs. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We carried out a longitudinal analysis of Landsat imagery of land use and land cover. The analysis revealed that the amount of land in the region covered by forest increased significantly in the period from 1991 to 2010 whilst crop/grass land decreased. Focus group meetings, key informant interviews and semi-structured interviews covering 424 households stratified by gender were used. The results show that natural resource uses are vitally important in the rural livelihoods. The drivers of land use and land cover change are agricultural expansion, population increase and illegal logging. Livelihood coping strategies include piecework, food aid, borrowing from relatives and wild food collection. By gender stratification, piecework contributed 37 and 63 % while agriculture contributed 29 and 71 % of the income of male- and female-headed households. Logistic regression analysis showed knowledge of regulations, age group and species availability significantly (p < 0.05) influenced the choice of a household's livelihood coping strategy. The study concludes that the changes in coping strategies influenced by a variety of factors have led to the diminished use of natural resources. For policy purposes, this suggests that state interventions can play a significant role in promoting more sustainable natural resource usage. This analysis enables effective decision-making to reconcile the efforts of sustainable development and natural resource management.",Rural livelihoods,Land use,Land cover,,Logistic regression,Change detection,Zambezi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This central role is largely the result of the possibilities to map and characterize land cover based on observations and remote sensing. This paper argues that more attention should be given to land use and land functions and linkages between these. Consideration of land functions that provide a wide range of goods and services makes more integrated assessments of land change possible. The increasing attention to multifunctional land use is another incentive to develop methods to assess changes in land functions. A number of methods to quantify and map the spatial extent of land use and land functions are discussed and the implications for modeling are identified based on recent model approaches in land change science. The mixed use of land cover, land use and land function in maps and models leads to inconsistencies in land change assessments. Explicit attention to the non-linear relations between land cover, land use and land function is essential to consistently address land change. New methods to map and quantify land function dynamics will enhance our ability to understand and model land system change and adequately inform policies and planning. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Myanmar is a key battleground for the global fight against malaria because it is where the emergence of drug-resistant malaria parasites has been documented. Controlling the spread of malaria in Myanmar thus carries global significance, because the failure to do so would lead to devastating consequences in vast areas where malaria is prevalent in tropical/subtropical regions around the world. Thanks to its wide and consistent spatial coverage, remote sensing has become increasingly used in the public health domain. Specifically, remote sensing-based land cover/land use (LCLU) maps present a powerful tool that provides critical information on population distribution and on the potential human-vector interactions interfaces on a large spatial scale. Here, we present a 30-meter LCLU map that was created specifically for the malaria control and eradication efforts in Myanmar.

In Ghana, the demand for fuel, food, and fibre is projected to be the driver of significant expansion of Croplands/mixed vegetation, resulting in degradation and deforestation of natural ecosystems. This research presents a spatiotemporal analysis of land use/cover change in the Bobiri forest and its surrounding areas in Ghana's moist semi-deciduous forest zone. The study aims to investigate the specific changes in dominant land use land cover (LULC) types in the area using land intensity analyses and to analyse the prevalence of deforestation leakage across the Bobiri Forest Reserve (BFR, a protected area) and its surrounding environs from 1986 and 2022. The study used measured land-cover changes at different levels, including intervals, categories, and transitions. The analysis revealed significant changes in land use intensity across different land classes in the area. The overall rate of land use and land cover change exhibited acceleration, indicating extensive land development throughout the studied periods. Notably, Croplands/mixed vegetation and non-vegetated areas experienced the most gains, while the closed forest class consistently declined. Transitions from forests to Croplands/mixed vegetation were observed, highlighting the conversion of natural vegetation for agricultural purposes. Additionally, the results reveal ongoing leakages in the buffer zone of the BFR as compared to the forest reserve with an annual deforestation rate of (0.64 %) and (0.06 %) respectively from 1986 to 2022, with non-vegetated areas and croplands/mixed vegetation dominating the periphery of protected forest areas. The study recommends implementing policy measures specifically geared towards protecting the buffer zone within a 10 km radius.

We develop a pilot set of national and subnational land accounts for the United States that are consistent with the SEEA-CF and SNA principles, quantified in both physical and monetary terms. The physical accounts utilize detailed land use (National Land Use Database) and land cover (National Land Cover Database) datasets, which provide insights into how land cover in the U.S. is changing over time. To provide aggregate estimates of land values, we use a hedonic approach that exploits fine-grain microdata (""big data"" from Zillow) that contains detailed information from hundreds of millions of property transactions and their corresponding physical characteristics covering much of the U.S. Methodologically, we show that it is feasible to produce monetary accounts for land that can be directly linked to and integrated with physical land cover/use. Overall, U.S. land cover has shown declines in forests, cropland, and pasture with increases in barren, scrub/shrub, and developed classes, which are particularly concentrated in the U.S. Southeast. Nominal land values in the U.S. fell about 28% ($7 trillion) from the boom to bust periods in the prior decade, albeit with substantial regional variation, and have subsequently experienced a nearly full recovery in recent years.

Most reconstructions have been based primarily on consistently available and relatively standardized information from historical sources. Based on available data sources and a retrospective research, in this paper we review the approaches and methods of the digital reconstruction and analyze their advantages and possible constraints in the following aspects: (1) Historical documents contain qualitative or semi-quantitative information about past land use, which also usually include land-cover data, but preparation of archival documents is very time-consuming. (2) Historical maps and pictures offer visual and spatial quantitative land-cover information. (3) Natural archive has significant advantages as a method for reconstructing past vegetation and has its unique possibilities especially when historical records are missing or lacking, but it has great limits of rebuilding certain land-cover types. (4) Historical reconstruction models have been gradually developed from empirical models to mechanistic ones. The method does not only reconstruct the quantity of land use/cover in historical periods, but it also reproduces the spatial distribution. Yet there are still few historical land-cover datasets with high spatial resolution. (5) Reconstruction method based on multiple-source data and multidisciplinary research could build historical land-cover from multiple perspectives, complement the missing data, verify reconstruction results and thus improve reconstruction accuracy. However, there are challenges that make the method still in the exploratory stage. This method can be a long-term development goal for the historical land-cover reconstruction.

Moreover, this comparison is also aimed at complementing the global validation report released with the WC20 product, which focused on global and continental level accuracy assessments, with no additional information for specific countries.

Some of the differences were due to the different minimum mapping unit ofCOS18 and WC20, different nomenclatures and focuses on either land use or land cover. Overall, the results show that while WC20 detail is able to distinguish small occurrences of artificial surfaces and grasslands within an urban environment, WC20 is often not able to distinguish sparse/individual trees from the neighboring cover, which is a common occurrence in the Portuguese landscape.

Over large areas land cover classification is challenging particularly due to the cost and difficulty of collecting representative training data that enable classifiers to be consistent and locally reliable. A novel methodology to classify large volume Landsat data using high quality training data derived from the 500 m MODIS land cover product is demonstrated and used to generate a 30 m land cover classification for all of North America between 20 degrees N and 50 degrees N. Publically available 30 m global monthly Web-enabled Landsat Data (GWELD) products generated from every available Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 5 TM image for a three year period, that are defined aligned to the MODIS land products and are consistently pre-processed data (cloud-screened, saturation flagged, atmospherically corrected and normalized to nadir BRDF adjusted reflectance), were classified. The MODIS 500 m land cover product was filtered judiciously, using only good quality pixels that did not change land cover class in 2009, 2010 or 2011, followed by automated selection of spatially corresponding 30 m GWELD temporal metric values, to define a large training data set sampled across North America. The training data were sampled so that the class proportions were the same as the North America MODIS land cover product class proportions and corresponded to 1% of the 500 m and <0.005% of the 30 m pixels. Thirty nine GWELD temporal metrics for every 30 m North America pixel location were classified using (a) a single random forest, and (b) a locally adaptive method with a random forest classifier derived and applied locally and the classification results spatially mosaicked together. The land cover classification results appeared geographically plausible and at synoptic scale were similar to the MODIS land cover product. Detailed visual inspection revealed that the locally adaptive random forest classifications and associated classification confidences were generally more coherent than the single random forest classification results. The level of agreement between the 30 m classifications and the MODIS land cover product derived training data was assessed by bootstrapping the random forest implementation. The locally adaptive random forest classification had higher overall agreement (95.44%, 0.9443 kappa) than the single random forest classification (93.13%, 0.9195 kappa).

Accurately modeling the extent of permafrost and permafrost changes is now an important challenge for climate change research and climate modeling in this region. Uncertainty in land use and land cover (LULC), which is important information characterizing surface conditions, directly affects the accuracy of the simulation of permafrost changes in land surface models. In order to investigate the effect of LULC uncertainty on permafrost simulation, we conducted simulation experiments on the TP using the Community Land Model, version 5 (CLM5) with five high-resolution LULC products in this study. Firstly, we evaluated the simulation results using shallow soil temperature data and deep borehole data at several sites. The results show that the model performs well in simulating shallow soil temperatures and deep soil temperature profiles. The effect of different land use products on the shallow soil temperature and deep soil temperature contours is not obvious due to the small differences in land use products at these sites. Although there is little difference in the simulating results of different land use products when compared to the permafrost distribution map, the differences are noticeable for the simulation of the active layer. Land cover had a greater impact on soil temperature simulations in regions with greater land use inconsistency, such as at the junction of bare soil and grassland in the northwestern part of the TP, as well as in the southeast region with complex topography. The main way in which this effect occurs is that land cover affects the net surface radiation, which in turn causes differences in soil temperature simulations. In addition, we discuss other factors affecting permafrost simulation results and point out that increasing the model plant function types as well as carefully selecting LULC products is one of the most important ways to improve the simulation performance of land-surface models in permafrost regions.",land use/land cover products,permafrost simulation,Tibetan Plateau,,land surface model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reviewers used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guideline in the reviewing process.

The change in land use in Ethiopia resulted not only in the loss of ESVs but also in the gain of ESVs depending on the type of man's activity. Negative change in LULC-especially the deterioration of land cover types such as forest land, shrub land and grass land-resulted in the loss of ESVs, whereas positive LULC change increased the value of ESVs. In Ethiopia, there is a loss of about USD 85 billion per year from the loss of ecosystem services. To save, improve and promote ESVs, land restoration and rehabilitation activities are important.

Despite the fact that the interventions covered the majority of the landmasses, there were no quantitative data on the scale of biophysical measures with the change in land use and land cover. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate biophysical conservation practices with dynamic land use and land cover in the highlands of Ethiopia. The study focused on districts of the Amhara regional state's South Gondar zone. A mixed research methodology was employed to gather pertinent data for the study. The dynamics of LULC were analyzed using satellite images acquired between 1990 and 2020. Biophysical conservation measures' data and qualitative information were collected from the zonal office of agriculture. Twelve years' worth of biophysical SWC measures data were used for the study. The results indicate that cultivated land makes up the majority of land use and land cover. Bunds built on cultivated land account for 93% of conservation practices. During the study period, there was a significant decline of biophysical conservation practices implementation in each district. Although plantation was used on a wider scale, it was unable to sustain physical SWC practices or expand forest cover in the region. In addition, lack of integrated maintenance for early installed structures decreases the effectiveness of SWC measures. In conclusion, the dynamics of LULC have a significant impact on the magnitude of biophysical conservation measures. Therefore, watershed managers shall consider the spatio-temporal variation of LULC while planning conservation practices.",land degradation,land use land cover,biophysical measures,,maintenance,sustainability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study focused on the central and northern zones of Sinaloa, Mexico, an agriculturally important region where cultivated land has expanded in recent years, covering the period from 1993 to 2017. The results demonstrated that the study area exhibited an increase in LST over time, which was strongly linked to the expansion of agricultural land. The least-squares method also demonstrated warming trends in both the winter and summer seasons. An increasing rate of 0.1672 degrees C/year was found in winter, while a LST value of 0.1176 degrees C/year was found in summer.

New global land cover products at 300 m resolution from the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative Land Cover (CCI LC) project for epochs centered around 2000, 2005 and 2010 were analyzed to investigate forest area change and land cover transitions. Plant functional types (PFTs) fractions were derived from these land cover products according to a conversion table. The gross global forest loss between 2000 and 2010 is 172,171 km(2), accounting for 0.6% of the global forest area in year 2000. The forest changes are mainly distributed in tropical areas such as Brazil and Indonesia. Forest gains were only observed between 2005 and 2010 with a global area of 9844 km(2), mostly from crops in Southeast Asia and South America. The predominant PFT transition is deforestation from forest to crop, accounting for four-fifths of the total increase of cropland area between 2000 and 2010. The transitions from forest to bare soil, shrub, and grass also contributed strongly to the total areal change in PFTs. Different PFT transition matrices and composition patterns were found in different regions. The highest fractions of forest to bare soil transitions were found in the United States and Canada, reflecting forest management practices. Most of the degradation from grassland and shrubland to bare soil occurred in boreal regions. The areal percentage of forest loss and land cover transitions generally decreased from 2000-2005 to 2005-2010. Different data sources and uncertainty in the conversion factors (converting from original LC classes to PFTs) contribute to the discrepancy in the values of change in absolute forest area.

Today, simulation models created by geospatial data mining (GDM) techniques are frequently used to model the effects of uncontrolled urban sprawl on land use/land cover (LULC) changes. However, most of these models have yet to consider the impact of ownership diversities. The study's main purpose is to investigate the interactions and interdependencies between Spatiotemporal LULC changes and private land ownership and monitor the precipitous urban sprawl through simulation models created by GDM techniques. In this context, the Sancaktepe district of Istanbul, where the population growth is rapid and the LULC change is very excessive, was chosen as the study area. CORINE LULC data for 1990, 2000, and 2018 were used in the study. Two hybrid prediction models were produced for 2040 by integrating multi-layer perception (MLP) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms with Markov Chains (MC) method. A base model was prepared with the intersection of these two to take protection precautions in the short and medium term. According to the results, it was determined by MLP that private land ownership significantly affects LULC.

LULC changes were assessed through intensity analyses at the interval and transition levels. LULC changes were initially rapid (1990-1995) and then more gradual (1995-2000, 2000-2005, and 2005-2010). Unlike in previous intervals, annual changes were uniformly distributed over time in 2010-2015 and 2015-2020. Driven by high population and economic growth, built-up land was identified as an active gainer in all intervals except 2010-2015. Alongside built-up areas, cropland was the main supplier of other categories, including bare land, pond, built-up, and green areas. The largest transition area occurred in pond and green areas during 2005-2010 and in built-up land during 2015-2020. High demand for built-up land was observed in land changes driven by high population growth triggered by economic necessity.

The study results indicated that forest (79.5%), cultivated land (10.6%), and grassland (8.3%) were the dominant land use types in Laos over the past two decades. The forest area decreased significantly, while there were increases in other land types, and the forest was transformed into cultivated land and grassland. ES in Laos was valued at about USD 140-150 billion, with forest contributing the most, followed by cultivated land and grassland. ESV over the last two decades in Laos has increased by USD 3.94 million. Large values were assigned to regulating services (40%) and supporting services (14%). The ESV of food production, soil formation, and water supply increased, and the ESV of climate regulation, genetic resources, and erosion control decreased. In addition, the elasticity value of artificial surfaces was more prominent, with a more evident impact on ESV. For future development, Laos should rationally plan land resources, develop sustainable industries, maintain the dynamic balance of second-category ESV, and achieve sustainable economic and ecological development.

TheLUDDin Anhui Province from 2005 to 2009 is 3.06% for MCD12Q1 and 0.90% for GlobCover. Additionally, the transfer matrix is also constructed to explore the land cover changes. The significant differences between the two datasets are attributed to forestland and grassland. We conclude that the differences are primarily ascribed to the classification systems.

The central place of integrated land use transport strategy in improving urban sustainability has been a widespread acceptance. The purpose of this research is to investigate the relationship between land use/land cover types and transport characteristics. Traffic zones, as the spatial analysis unit, are generated by partitioning parcels with single land use/land cover type. Driving accessibility, cycling accessibility and walking accessibility are proposed to quantify the transport characteristics of traffic zones. Taking Eindhoven, the Netherlands as study area, the three accessibility patterns differ but all show strong positive spatial autocorrelation. Clustering method is adopted to synthesize accessibility indicators and group traffic zones with similar transport characteristics into clusters. An contingency table analysis indicates that land use/land cover types are significantly associated with clusters, on which the validation and quantification of experience in the relationship of land use/land cover and transport are based: residential area and commercial area mainly concentrate in high accessible clusters (6 and 7); industrial area and open space tend to favor clusters (4 and 6) with adequate driving accessibility; the high percentage of natural area in medium accessible clusters (4 and 5), especially in less accessible clusters (1, 2 and 3) corroborates the low demands of natural area on mobility service. Clustering map and accessibility patterns can identify the gaps in coverage of mobility service and in efficiency of land use/land cover pattern. The applicability of these tools is demonstrated by two cases. Recommendations for urban planning are obtained from this study considering both land use and transport aspects.",Accessibility,Transport characteristics,Land use,,land cover type,Clustering analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, differences in the multiple sets of LULC products in portraying the land composition of the YRB limit our understanding of the land cover composition in this region. To address this issue, this study chose five sets of open and high spatiotemporal LULC data in 2020, namely, CLCD, LSV10, ESRI10, CLC_FCS30, and Globeland30, to evaluate the accuracy and consistency of classification in the YRB. Our results show that: (1) The LULC composition of the YRB in 2020 was mapped consistently by the five datasets. Grasslands, croplands, and woodlands constitute the major LULC types, accounting for 96% of the total area of the study area. (2) The correlation coefficients of the LULC types of any two of the five datasets ranged from 0.926 to 0.998, showing high land compositional consistency. However, among the five datasets, there were considerable differences in the areas of a single LULC type. (3) The classification consistencies of croplands, woodlands, grasslands, and water bodies were higher than 60% in any two datasets. The spatial consistencies of grasslands, croplands, and woodlands were higher than those of other LULC types. An area with better consistency can reach more than 50% of the average area of the corresponding land types, but grasslands were mixed with other LULC types in ESRI10 and GLC_FCS30. (4) According to the accuracy assessments, LSV10 data have the highest overall classification accuracy, 79.32%, and the classification accuracy of major land types is also higher than 70%; GLC_FCS30 data have the lowest overall accuracy, 70.14%. Based on these results, LSV10 can more accurately demonstrate LULC than the other four datasets. This study can be used as a reference for selecting land cover data, and it also highlights that the necessary assessments of consistency and accuracy are essential when conducting land use/cover change studies in a specific region.",land use land cover datasets,accuracy assessment,classification consistency,,spatial consistency,Yellow River Basin (YRB),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While most small area studies have gathered data from different sources and research over a short period, across large areas most historical studies have been based on aerial photographs such as the Land Resource Mapping Project in 1986. The recent trend in studies in Nepal is to focus on new concepts and techniques to analyze LULC status on the basis of satellite imagery, with the help of geographic information system and remote sensing tools. Studies based on historical documents, and historical and recent spatial data on LULC, have clearly shown an increase in cropland areas in Nepal, and present results indicating different rates and magnitudes. A decrease in forest and snow/glacier coverage is reported in most studies. Little information is available on grassland and urban areas from past research. The unprecedented rate of urbanization in Nepal has led to significant urban land changes over the past 30 years.

This paper proposed several guidelines for building a land use/cover classification system, which encompasses the basic concept of land use and land cover. Then a preliminary framework for Chinese land use/cover classification system at different scale based on remote sensing data was detailed. The framework is made up of four scales, including national scale, regional scale, county scale and country scale. The classes of first level at national scale in the system are agriculture land, woodland, natural grassland, built-up land, water, wetland and barren land. The regional scale includes 27 classes of land use/cover and the county scale includes 43 types. The general diagnostic criterion of the first level of classification system is the situation of existing vegetation, soil and water, artificial and natural surface.

It has been noticed that a significant part of the artificial areas, which are in continuous development, has expanded towards the agricultural lands. Also, it was determined that the area that LC/ LU expanded the most was agriculture, and the places where LC/LU decerased its area the most were forest areas.

The Llap river basin lies in the north-eastern part of Kosovo, which is discerned as a morphological whole with particular physical - geographic elements. Since the past, relief was a factor with direct and indirect impact on land cover and especially on land use. The essential part of the analysis was the correlation of the geomorphometric parameters (altitude and slope) with land cover and land use. For calculating these parameters, a digital elevation model of 12 m / pixel was downloaded from the Alaska Satellite Facility. On the other hand, the CORINE Land Cover 2012 data from the European Environment Agency (EEA) were used for land cover. The completion of the analysis was done in that form for each category of geomorphometric parameters was compared with land cover and land use.

It is worth mentioning that no comprehensive study has been done so far on the overall change of LULC within the surrounding of Desa'a forest areas. This study aimed at analyzing the LULC changes and driving factors in Desa'a forest through Landsat images (i.e., 1973 (MSS), 1986 (TM), and 2015 (OLI)) and maximum likelihood supervised classification. Post classification pixel to pixel comparison was also performed to detect changes from year to year. Finally, focus group discussions were made to identify the LULC change drivers and support the computer-based classifications accuracy. Results demonstrated that both dense (54.11%) and open forest (28.48%) in 1973 covered almost 83% of the total forest area while only 17% was covered by grasslands (10%), farmland (3%), and bare land (4%). This is despite the fact that woody vegetation covered only 39% of the total forest reserve in 2015. During the study period, almost 54,000 ha of grasslands and open and dense forests have been converted to either bare land or farmland, of which 48,163 ha were previously open dense forests. Continuing with such a trend will lead to more severe deforestation and it is necessary to identify and modify the driving variables in Desa'a forest. The results also showed that fire, agricultural expansion, grazing and browsing effect, drought, extraction of wood, and lack of government attention are the major deforestation driver in Desa'a forest. The results of this study can provide a practical perspective for land use planners to manage LULC changes, reduce greenhouse gases, and enhance the biodiversity conservation in the region. In addition, the findings of the current study could provide a perfect source for calculations and choosing the best policy-making decisions to protect and manage plans for Desa'a forest.",Land use land cover,Remote sensing,Change detection,,Deforestation,Carbon balance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The natural conditions in the Czech border areas were identified as another significant factor influencing changes. Changes influenced by these two factors, in combination with several other drivers, are reflected in changes in proportions of land-use and land-cover categories.

These changes have had great impact on ecosystem functions at both local and regional scales. The Gobi Desert area near Zhangye City, Gansu Province, P.R. China has been blamed for the frequent occurrence of dust and sand storms in remote areas such as the Beijing and HuaBei regions.

The regional landscape ecology for 1977, 1989 and 2002 was quantified using both traditional classification techniques as well as the continuous field method, the latter being a measure of land degradation severity. These remote sensing products were used to quantify the magnitude of the land use and land cover changes over 25 years. The results indicate that agricultural areas increased from 6% to 15% due to increased human activities. At the same time, other land use areas decreased because of conversion into agriculture lands. Land degradation in the region was obvious as evidenced by the increase in lower vegetative areas (0 to 10% fractional vegetation cover) and disappearance of high vegetative areas (90% or more).

Over the past three decades, agricultural land, commercial farm, built-up, and water bodies have increased while forestland, rangeland, grazing land, and swampy areas have decreased. Intensive agriculture without proper management practice has been a common problem of the catchment. Increased cultivation of steep slopes has increased the risk of erosion and sedimentation of nearby water bodies. Multiple factors, such as biophysical, socio-economic, institutional, technological, and demographic, contributed to the observed LULCC in the study area. A decline in agricultural yield, loss of biodiversity, extended aridity and drought, land and soil degradation, and decline of water resources are the major consequences of LULCC in the Finchaa catchment.

In Ethiopia, Africa, the rapid variations of LULC observed in the last decades are mainly due to population pressure, resettlement programs, climate change, and other human- and nature-induced driving forces. Anthropogenic activities are the most significant factors adversely changing the natural status of the landscape and resources, which exerts unfavourable and adverse impacts on the environment and livelihood. The main goal of the present work is to review previous studies, discussing the spatiotemporal LULC changes in Ethiopian basins, to find out common points and gaps that exist in the current literature, to be eventually addressed in the future. A total of 25 articles, published from 2011 to 2020, were selected and reviewed, focusing on LULC classification using ArcGIS and ERDAS imagine software by unsupervised and maximum likelihood supervised classification methods. Key informant interview, focal group discussions, and collection of ground truth information using ground positioning systems for data validation were the major approaches applied in most of the studies. All the analysed research showed that, during the last decades, Ethiopian lands changed from natural to agricultural land use, waterbody, commercial farmland, and built-up/settlement. Some parts of forest land, grazing land, swamp/wetland, shrubland, rangeland, and bare/ rock out cropland cover class changed to other LULC class types, mainly as a consequence of the increasing anthropogenic pressure. In summary, these articles confirmed that LULC changes are a direct result of both natural and human influences, with anthropogenic pressure due to globalisation as the main driver. However, most of the studies provided details of LULC for the past decades within a specific spatial location, while they did not address the challenge of forecasting future LULC changes at the watershed scale, therefore reducing the opportunity to develop adequate basin-wide management strategies for the next years.",Africa,Ethiopia,geographic information systems,,land use land cover change,remote sensing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We first explore the relation-ship between LST and vegetation, man-made features, and cropland using normalized vegetation, and built-up indices within each LULC type. Afterwards, we assess the impacts of LULC change and urbanization in UHI using hot spot analysis (Getis-Ord Gi* statistics) and urban landscape analysis. Finally, we pro-pose a model applying non-parametric regression to estimate future urban climate patterns using predicted land cover and land use change. Results from this work provide an effective methodology for UHI characterization, showing that (a) LST depends on a nonlinear way of LULC types; (b) hotspot anal-ysis using Getis Ord Gi* statistics allows to analyze the LST pattern change through time; (c) UHI is influ-enced by both urban landscape and urban development type; (d) LST pattern forecast and UHI effect examination can be done by the proposed model using nonlinear regression and simulated LULC change scenarios. We chose an inner city area of Hanoi as a case-study, a small and flat plain area where LULC change is significant due to urbanization and industrialization.

Using remote sensing techniques, geographic information systems (GIS) and statistical modeling via multinomial logistic regression, we sought to identify spatial variables that determine LULC change and their extent over time in the protected and communal areas of the Zambezi Region, Namibia. Multi-temporal satellite imagery of the Landsat series was used to map changes over a period of twenty-six years, divided into three stages (1984-1991, 1991-2000 and 2000-2010). Post classification change detection methodologies were used to determine conversions between LULC classes. Additionally, socio-economic characteristics of the area were used to identify drivers of changes. Four spatial drivers of LULC change that we identified included the distance to the nearest road, distance to settlements, population density and fire return periods. Population density, distance to settlements and fire return period were significantly associated with conversion from crop/grass land to crop/grass land and forest land to crop/grass, forest land to bare land and forest land to forest land in the protected area. In communal areas, distance to the road was found to significantly influence conversion from crop/grass land to crop/grass land. The study concluded that the influence of these drivers is attributable to distinct political and agro-demographical differences during the study period. Policy makers and planners need to take these drivers into consideration together with their subsidiaries to respond and make sound decisions regarding undesirable changes in LULC.",land use,land cover,spatial drivers,,logistic regression,Zambezi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The approaches for dealing with semantic heterogeneity have been developed in terms of semantic similarity. Generally speaking, these approaches lack domain ontologies, which might be a significant barrier to implementing these approaches in terms of semantic similarity assessment. In this paper, we propose an ontological approach to assess the similarity of the domain of LULC classification systems and standards. We develop domain ontologies to explicitly define the descriptions and codes of different LULC classification systems and standards as semantic information, and formally organize this semantic information as rules for logical reasoning. Then, we utilize a Bayes algorithm to create a conditional probabilistic model for computing the semantic similarity of terms in two separate LULC land cover classification systems. The experiment shows that semantic similarity can be effectively measured by integrating a probabilistic model based on the content of ontology.",ontology,semantic similarity,land use/land cover classification systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The combined use of land cover and land-use data allows detection of where certain changes occur, what type of change, as well as how the land is changing. Existing systems for classification of land cover or land-use are limited in the storage of the number of classes and are often internally inconsistent. Therefore, FAO developed the land cover classification system (LCCS), a comprehensive parametric classification based upon systematic description of classes using a set of independent quantifiable diagnostic criteria. With this approach land cover change detection becomes possible at the level of conversion of a class, whereas modification within a certain class type becomes immediately identifiable by a difference in classifier, or through the use of additional classifiers as is shown in a series of examples illustrating the application of the approach to primarily vegetated areas. The development of a similar classification approach for land-use is in progress. The proposed approach combines function, grouping all land used for a similar economic purpose, with activity, grouping all land undergoing a certain process resulting in a homogeneous type of products. The preliminary concepts have been tested in two applications that have shown that the system can be used as a bridging system that will ensure compatibility with, and bridge, existing systems. Furthermore, by providing (part of) the diagnostic criteria the system contributes to providing a uniform basis for environmental change detection and these criteria contribute, in turn, to standardisation. Land cover boundaries do not necessarily coincide with land-uses and the land cover/land-use relation needs more study to understand its complexity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This study evaluated land restoration in terms of land cover changes in the Horqin Sandy Land from 2000 to 2018 and analyzed the related influencing factors. The results showed that land restoration and land degradation accounted for 37.55% and 4.47% of the total area, respectively. Land restoration has improved substantially, and desertification control has achieved remarkable effects. NPP trends should be analyzed in combination with land cover types. When the land cover has changed, the type of land cover change and the period need to be clarified before analyzing the corresponding NPP trend to depict the land productivity accurately. The vegetation NPP changes following land cover conversions were more essential than land cover change types. Changes in precipitation and temperature had positive effects on the growth of vegetation and land restoration. In general, human activities promoted land restoration, including grazing policies, cropland utilization activities, and ecological restoration projects. Current land restoration, however, essentially sacrifices the groundwater resources, which challenges the sustainability of land restoration. Appropriate land use strategies were proposed to promote sustainable land use, including preventing vegetation degradation following land cover conversions, improving grassland construction, and coordinating the usage of cropland and water resources.

Ethiopia has experienced one of the largest amounts of LSLTs in Africa, yet their effects on local land systems are poorly understood. In this study, we quantify the direct and indirect land use and land cover (LULC) changes associated with LSLTs at eight socio-environmentally diverse sites in central and western Ethiopia. To estimate these effects, we employ a novel, two-stage counterfactual analysis. We first use a region-growing procedure to identify a ""control"" site with comparable landscape-level characteristics to each LSLT. Then, we sample and reweight points within each control site to further improve covariate balance. This two-stage approach both controls for potential confounding factors at multiple spatial levels and reduces the costs of extensive LULC data classification. Our results show that the majority of the reported transacted area (62%) remained unconverted to large-scale agriculture. Most of the land that was developed into large-scale agriculture displaced smallholder agriculture (53%), followed by conversion of woodland/shrubland (35%) and forest (9%). Beyond their boundaries, LSLTs indirectly influenced rates of smallholder agricultural expansion and abandonment, pointing to site dependence in how LSLTs affect adjacent land systems. In particular, the low prevalence of forest within and around these LSLTs underscores a need to move beyond measures of deforestation as proxies for LSLT effects on land systems.

With this premise, an 'Open-source Land-use and Land-cover Dynamics Modeling platform' (OpenLDM) is developed and presented in this paper. The platform integrates different components of empirical land change modeling cycle such as model selection from the available parametric and nonparametric methods; suitability map generation; demand generation; allocation (in spatial or non-spatial context); simulation of future LULC map based on business-as-usual or demand-and-policy-driven scenarios; accuracy assessment; and visualization. Suitability maps for each LULC class can be generated using techniques like regression (logistic and linear), artificial neural network (ANN), and random forest (RF) and user-controlled spatial context. The statistical aids provided for parametric methods help selecting relevant drivers for each LULC class. The support for policy interventions such as goal-specific LULC class demand distribution, land conversion prioritization, and control over spatial mobility of land classes are possible by providing LULC demand, allocation-priority matrix, and class-inertia parameters. R and Python programming languages are used for development, considering portability to other open-source platforms.

For this reason, this study examined the existence, rate, and spatial distribution of land use and land cover as well as the future changes in land cover in the metropolis. Landsat imagery spanning from 1991, 2009, 2016, to 2023 provided the basis for evaluating the spatiotemporal dynamics of land use and cover within the metropolis. The Random Forest Classification algorithm was employed to categorize the images into three distinct classes: water, vegetation, and built-up areas.

Here, we investigate the effect of precipitation and LULC on the reflectance of the land surface in the northern U.S. Great Plains. We utilize time series satellite data from the 45 year Landsat archive. The length of the Landsat record allows for analysis of multiple periods of drought and wet conditions (reflecting climate, as well as weather), such that the precipitation-reflectance relationship can be investigated robustly for every individual pixel in the study area. The high spatial resolution of Landsat (30 m) allows for investigation of spatial patterns in weather (i.e., precipitation extremes) interactions with land surface reflectance at the scale of individual fields. Weather history is represented by a drought index that describes effective moisture availability, the Standardized Precipitation and Evaporation Index (SPEI). We find that effective moisture has a robust and consistent effect on reflectance over many types of land cover, with similar to 90% of all pixels having significantly (p<0.01) higher visible reflectance during dry periods than during wet, occurring in nearly all regional, temporal, and LULC categories investigated. In grassland, the relationship is especially strong; there is an average reflectance increase of more than a third between very wet and very dry conditions (red band), and similar to 99% of pixels have a significant relationship.

These data originate from different sources and inventory techniques. Each source of land use/cover data has its own domain of applicability and quality standards. Often data are selected without explicitly considering the suitability of the data for the specific application, the bias originating from data inventory and aggregation, and the effects of the uncertainty in the data on the results of the assessment. Uncertainties due to data selection and handling can be in the same order of magnitude as uncertainties related to the representation of the processes under investigation. While acknowledging the differences in data sources and the causes of inconsistencies, several methods have been developed to optimally extract information from the data and document the uncertainties. These methods include data integration, improved validation techniques and harmonization of classification systems. Based on the data needs of global change studies and the data availability, recommendations are formulated aimed at optimal use of current data and focused efforts for additional data collection.

The possible method described in the present paper to obtain urban land use types is based on the principle that land use can be derived from the land cover existing in a neighborhood. Here, moving window is used to represent the spatial pattern of land cover within a neighborhood and seven window sizes (61mx61 m, 68mx68m, 75mx75m, 87mx87m, 99mx99m, 110mx110m and 121mxl21m) are applied to determining the most proper window size. Then, the unsupervised method of ISODATA is employed to classify the layered land cover density maps obtained by the moving window. The results of accuracy evaluation show that the window size of 99mx99m is proper to infer urban land use categories and the proposed method has produced a land use map with a total accuracy of 85%.",urban land use,land cover density map,high-resolution image,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cukurova Region, whose agricultural potential with fertile soils formed by alluvial deposit and suitable climate is quite high, has experienced rapid urbanization and industrialization over the past four decades. Depending on industrial activities and population growth, Adana has entered a process of both socio-cultural and spatial change in the 1970s. Nowadays its urbanization process rapidly continues with population about two million. In this study, spatial changes and agricultural land loss is analyzed caused by urban sprawl using the Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques.In order to analyze land use/land cover (LULC) changes, LULC classification maps belonging to years 1970, 1985, 2000 and 2015 were produced and analyses were made in three periods covering 15 years each (1970-1985, 1985-2000, 2000-2015). It was observed in the results that while build-up area expanded by 1125,23% between years 1970 and 2015, farmland decreased by 37,33%, forestland decreased by 76,86% and bushland decreased by 53,48%. According to the calculated Urbanization Intensity Index (UII), urbanization occurred most rapidly in years between 1970 and 1985 (UII=0,96). Related with the rapid spatial expansion of the city, dynamic index (DI) of build-up was found to be very high compared to the DI of other land uses. While the DI of build-up area was 29,03 between years 1970 and 2015, the DI of farmland was calculated as -0,94. According to the transition matrix created under the scope of the study, totally 9743 ha farmland, 794ha forestland and 738ha bushland were converted into build-up area.

Understanding how land use/cover changes (LULCC) influence watershed hydrology will enable local governments and policymakers to formulate and implement effective and appropriate response strategies to minimize the undesirable effects of future land use/cover change or modification and sustain the local socio-economic situation. The hydrological response of the Ethiopia Fincha'a watershed to LULCC that happened during 25 years was investigated, comparing the situation in three reference years: 1994, 2004, and 2018. The information was derived from Landsat sensors, respectively Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM, and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS. The various LULC classes were derived via ArcGIS using a supervised classification system, and the accuracy assessment was done using confusion matrixes. For all the years investigated, the overall accuracies and the kappa coefficients were higher than 80%, with 2018 as the more accurate year. The analysis of LULCC revealed that forest decreased by 20.0% between the years 1994-2004, and it decreased by 11.8% in the following period 2004-2018. Such decline in areas covered by forest is correlated to an expansion of cultivated land by 16.4% and 10.81%, respectively. After having evaluated the LULCC at the basin scale, the watershed was divided into 18 sub-watersheds, which contained 176 hydrologic response units (HRUs), having a specific LULC. Accounting for such a detailed subdivision of the Fincha'a watershed, the SWAT model was firstly calibrated and validated on past data, and then applied to infer information on the hydrological response of each HRU on LULCC. The modelling results pointed out a general increase of average water flow, both during dry and wet periods, as a consequence of a shift of land coverage from forest and grass towards settlements and build-up areas. The present analysis pointed out the need of accounting for past and future LULCC in modelling the hydrological responses of rivers at the watershed scale.",Africa,Ethiopia,landsat,,land use land cover changes,remote sensing,SWAT model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the Cellular Automata Markov Chain (CA-MC) process has been advocated as a promising approach in LCLU predictions, this process excludes the underlying processes that drive behavior in the context of LCLU change. Behavioral analyses can uncover motivations by considering a wider range of factors and shedding light on potential uncertainties associated with the CA-MC process. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to incorporate social behavior in the process of LCLU predictions through a novel comparative framework that allows for uncertainty assessment in predicting LCLU changes. We propose a novel comparative framework to assess uncertainty in predicting LCLU changes. The framework compares a behavioral mental model with a Cellular Automata Markov Chain (CA-MC) model expanded through its multi-criteria decision analyses (MCDA) to cover natural and socio-economic factors under a GIS platform. Both models rely on field survey responses of farmers under climate change stress in the same test area as well as historical data for validation and verification with the aim to improve the LCLU prediction ability. Using past land cover maps, the CA-MC approach exhibited a good similarity between simulated and past observed results (71 %) and predicted future urbanization expansion (93 % in 15 years) being the driving force behind the loss of grasslands (73 %) and forests (5 %). However, when both models are compared, agricultural and urban areas exhibited 17 % and 47 % differences reflecting an appreciable level of uncertainty in LCLU predictions. The outcomes highlight the importance of considering behavioral processes in LCLU predictions towards sustainable land management.",Land cover land use,Sustainable land development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, the effect of LULC changes on seasonal land surface temperature modification over the urbanized area is also assessed in this study. The result suggests an overall increase of built-up area from 116.6 km(2) in 1990 to 166.9 km(2) in 2019, witnessing a 43.1% rise during the study period, while the other LULC classes show a decreasing trend, most significantly by agriculture (40.8%) followed by scrubland (37.1%), fallow land (22%), water body (11.1%) and vegetation (2.8%).

The overall mean land surface temperature over the city shows an increasing trend during the summer season (5.8%) and decreasing in the winter season (12.4%) from 1990 to 2019. The change in mean LST over different LULC classes shows a significant increasing and positive trend during the summer season as compared to the negative and decreasing trend of the winter season. The mean LST over agriculture, shrub land, water body, and fallow land shows an increasing trend as compared to the built-up area during both summer and winter season from 1990 to 2019. Furthermore, the study also confirms a higher LST over the surrounding rural area by 1.4 degrees C, as compared to the city urban area, which suggests the occurrence of the urban cool island over the city.

The uncertainties in six 1-km global land cover datasets were found to be transferred to land cover datasets derived by either the dominant land cover type method (DLM) or the area ratio method (ARM). The agreement among the DLM-derived land cover datasets (the DLM agreement) was higher than the per-pixel agreement among the six 1-km global land cover datasets owing to the spatial aggregation effect. The agreement among the ARM-derived land cover datasets using the ARM (the ARM agreement) was higher than the DLM agreement because of the area ratio retention effect. The area ratios of all land cover types affect the ARM agreement, whereas only the dominant land cover type affects the DLM agreement. The DLM and ARM agreements were both strongly correlated with the per-pixel agreement among the 1-km global land cover datasets. Therefore, reducing the uncertainty in the 1-km global land cover datasets is the key to reducing the uncertainty in the land cover datasets used in land-surface models. Improving the land cover classification, especially in areas with small homogeneous regions or in transition zones between major land cover types, is also important for reducing the uncertainty in the datasets used for land-surface models. These sources of uncertainty should be taken into account when interpreting the land-surface model results.

If past land use affects rates of forest disturbance and afforestation then this may constrain land use planning and land management options, and legacies of current land management may constrain future land use. Our goal was to assess if and how much land-use legacies affect contemporary forest disturbance, and the abundance of different forest types in the Carpathian region in Eastern Europe (265,000 km(2), encompassing parts of Poland, Slovakia, Ukraine, Romania, Hungary, and Czech Republic). We modeled contemporary forest disturbance (based on satellite image analysis from 1985 to 2010) as a function of historic land use (based on digitized topographic maps from 1860 and 1960). Contemporary forest disturbance was strongly related to historic land use even when controlling for environmental, accessibility and socio-political variation. Across the Carpathian region, the odds of forest disturbance were about 50% higher in areas that were not forested in 1860 (new forests) compared to areas that were forested then (old forests). The forest disturbance in new forests was particularly high in Poland (88% higher odds), Slovakia (69%) and Romania (67%) and persisted across the entire range of environmental, accessibility and socio-political variation. Reasons for the observed legacy effects may include extensive plantations outside forest ranges, predominantly spruce, poplar, and black locust, which are prone to natural disturbances. Furthermore, as plantations reach harvestable age of about 70 years for pulp and 120 year for saw-timber production, these are likely to be clear-cut, producing the observed legacy effects. Across the Carpathians, forest types shifted towards less coniferous cover in 2010 compared to the 1860s and 1960s likely due to extensive historic conifer harvest, and to recent natural disturbance events and clear-cuts of forest plantations. Our results underscore the importance of land-use legacies, and show that past land uses can greatly affect subsequent forest disturbance for centuries. Given rapid land use changes worldwide, it is important to understand how past legacies affect current management and what the impact of current land management decisions may be for future land use.

In this study, an ASTER sensor imagery, which was converted into top-of-atmosphere reflectance (TOA), was used to classify the land use/cover types, according to COoRdination of INformation on the Environment (CORINE) land cover nomenclature, for an area representing the heterogonous characteristics of eastern Mediterranean regions in Kahramanmaras, Turkey. The results indicated that using the surface reflectance data of ASTER sensor imagery can provide accurate (i. e. overall accuracy and kappa values of 83.2% and 0.79, respectively) and low-cost cover mapping as a part of inventory for CORINE Land Cover Project.",classification,land use/cover,ASTER,,TOA,CORINE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Land cover maps having partial or complete spatial and/or temporal overlap, different legends, and varying accuracies for similar classes, are increasingly common. To address these concerns and combine two 30-m resolution land cover products, we implemented a harmonization procedure using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. The LDA model used regionalized class co-occurrences from multiple maps to generate a harmonized class label for each pixel by statistically characterizing land attributes from the class co-occurrences. We evaluated multiple harmonization approaches: using the LDA model alone and in combination with more commonly used information sources for harmonization (i.e. error matrices and semantic affinity scores). The results were compared with the benchmark maps generated using simple legend crosswalks and showed that using LDA outputs with error matrices performed better and increased harmonized map overall accuracy by 6-19% for areas of disagreement between the source maps. Our results revealed the importance of error matrices to harmonization, since excluding error matrices reduced overall accuracy by 4-20%.

Biodiversity can be measured in many ways. The concept covers not only the overall richness of species present in a particular area but also the diversity of genotypes, functional groups, communities, habitats and ecosystems there. As a result, the relationships between biodiversity in its broadest sense and land use can be complex and highly context dependent. Moreover, the relationships between them are often two-way, so that simple relationships between cause and effect can be difficult to identify. In some places, specific land uses or land management practices may be important in sustaining particular patterns of biodiversity. Elsewhere. the uses to which land can be put are highly dependent oil the biodiversity resources present.The review will consider how changes in the quantity, quality and spatial configuration of different aspects of land use can impact on different components of biodiversity, and what direct and indirect factors might drive these changes. The need to distinguish between land cover and land use will be discussed in relation to the economic and social drivers of land use change. The review will also consider whether framing biodiversity objectives involves society in placing constraints upon the types of land use and management practice that are possible, and will consider such arguments in relation to assessments of the costs of biodiversity loss. It Would seem that while considerable progress has been made in mapping Out plausible futures for land use and biodiversity at global and regional scales, closer integration of modelling, scenario and field-based monitoring is needed to strengthen the evidence base available to decision makers. Challenges that face us include how we take account of the qualitative changes in land cover, and the impacts Of Such modifications oil biodiversity and ecosystem services.

The high share of rural population (69%), the population density (130 inhabitants/sq km), as well as the dominance of intensely humanized plains and hills, are creating the premises of significant anthropogenic pressures, likely to put their mark on land use and vegetation cover. These factors are completed with socio-economic, political and legislative changes that affected Romania after 1990, such as: urban industry restructuring; migration of redundant labour force towards villages; restitution of agricultural and forestry land; and abandonment of agricultural land, due to low income level.In this context, we investigated the changes occurred in land use and land cover in Dambovita County, during the last two decades. The changes have been highlighted by analyzing statistical data and also through field observations and analysis of Corine Land Cover data for 1990, 2000 and 2006. Statistical analysis did not reveal significant changes in land use within 1990-2012, in the main categories of surfaces (agricultural and non-agricultural land). Within these categories, the most significant changes are found in the areas occupied by pastures (increase of approx. 19%), vineyards (decrease by 70%) and orchards (19% reduction). Analysis of Corine Land Cover data (level 1) emphasized small-scale changes in the sense of transfers from one category to another. Significant changes occurred generally within the same category (e.g. reducing of orchards and vineyards in favour of pastures and meadows).In terms of land cover changes, a real threat is the loss of biodiversity due to natural factors (e.g. oak drying tendency; warping of some lakes; the decrease of swampy areas) and anthropogenic factors (e.g. issues of land ownership; the lack of an effective security system of protected areas, so that some reserves have been severely affected by poaching, grazing in forests or illegal cutting of trees). Also, phenomena of vegetation degradation occurred, as well as the replacement of some species by others.

Both descriptive statistics and econometric model were employed for the analysis of drivers of eucalyptus plantation. LULC change detection technique was used to examine the changes in LULC over time.

It is expected to experience rising aridity and severe hydro-climatic events due to climate change. Subsistence agriculture and other rural livelihoods to which land cover is central are widely practiced in this impoverished territory of approximately eleven million people.The CADC's land cover was profiled to determine: a) how it differs from Non-CADC areas, and b) the role of land use in shaping these differences. Spatial autocorrelation analysis using satellite data showed that forest cover is a third less prevalent in the CADC than in the Non-CADC while the share of mosaic vegetation and mosaic cropland is nearly double. A naturally prevalent cover type in the CADC, tropical dry forest (TDF), has been largely eliminated.The significantly lesser proportion of forest and greater percentage of coverage consistent with agriculture and ranching implicate land use conversion, specifically deforestation for agricultural expansion and cattle ranching, in shaping CADC land coverage. The process began in the mid-1800s when small-scale agriculturalists migrated to the region followed by large-scale export crop and beef production, primarily for international markets. Deforestation peaked after WWII, concluding by the 1990s with the conversion of most woodlands. Similar patterns now threaten forests along the Caribbean coast.Traditional land use practices cannot sustain local communities or preserve the resource base, thereby contributing to rural outmigration.

As a result the land cover and land use information currently captured by Ordnance Survey fits more into historic cartographic categories than a classification system designed to be used for computational purposes.In future, the challenge for a National Mapping Agency is that designing a classification system that can respond to the needs of a variety of users, and where all possible end uses cannot be known a priori. However, there is no one ideal or universal classification of land use and land cover. A review of different land cover and land use classifications within the UK shows that a classification is usually designed for a particular purpose, a particular geographical area or a particular user. An attempt to create a national categorisation of land use and land cover was the NLUD (National Land Use Database) classification. However, this has gained little traction within government agencies and it lacks the degree of flexibility that a national classification should allow for.Our research has concentrated on two different levels: (i) the design of a flexible framework that would allow for the integration and relation of different classification systems and taxonomies and (ii) the design of an ontology and a high level classification system for use with data collected from different sources including remote sensing and GIS and fit for the purposes of a National Mapping framework.A test performed in the urban area of Bournemouth has showed promising results.

However, C sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems could contribute to the decrease of atmospheric CO2 rates. Although Mediterranean areas show a high potential for C sequestration, only a few studies have been carried out in these systems. In this study, we propose a methodology to assess the impact of land use and land cover change dynamics on soil organic C stocks at different depths. Soil C sequestration rates are provided for different land cover changes and soil types in Andalusia (southern Spain). Our research is based on the analysis of detailed soil databases containing data from 1357 soil profiles, the Soil Map of Andalusia and the Land Use and Land Cover Map of Andalusia. Land use and land cover changes between 1956 and 2007 implied soil organic C losses in all soil groups, resulting in a total loss of 168Tg (approximately 033Tg y(-1)). Afforestation increased soil organic C mostly in the topsoil, and forest contributed to sequestration of 862Mgha(-1) of soil organic C (254 per cent). Deforestation processes implied important C losses, particularly in Cambisols, Luvisols and Vertisols. The information generated in this study will be a useful basis for designing management strategies for stabilizing the increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations by preservation of C stocks and C sequestration.

Remote sensing thermal instruments onboard operational satellites are supposed to enable frequent and high-resolution observations over land; unfortunately, clouds adversely affect thermal signals by blocking outgoing longwave radiation emission from the Earth's surface, interfering with the retrieved ground emission temperature. Such cloud contamination severely reduces the set of serviceable LST images for downstream applications, making it impractical to perform intricate time-series analysis of LST. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to remove cloud occlusions from Landsat 8 LST images. We call our method ISLAND, an acronym for Interpolating Land Surface Temperature using land cover. Our approach uses LST images from Landsat 8 (at 30 m resolution with 16-day revisit cycles) and the NLCD land cover dataset. Inspired by Tobler's first law of Geography, ISLAND predicts occluded LST through a set of spatio-temporal filters that perform distance-weighted spatiotemporal interpolation. A critical feature of ISLAND is that the filters are land cover-class aware, making it particularly advantageous in complex urban settings with heterogeneous land cover types and distributions. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis, we show that ISLAND achieves robust reconstruction performance across a variety of cloud occlusion and surface land cover conditions, and with a high spatio-temporal resolution. We provide a public dataset of 20 U.S. cities with pre-computed ISLAND LST outputs. Using several case studies, we demonstrate that ISLAND opens the door to a multitude of high-impact urban and environmental applications across the continental United States.",Cloud removal,Land surface temperature,Thermal imaging,,Landsat,Land cover,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our findings indicate two major changes in LULC: an increase in closed canopy forest and substantial urban growth. LULC diversity increased between 1999 and 2009, suggesting a transition between land uses and/or a diversification of livelihood strategies. Socioeconomic proxies are significant predictors of LULC diversity in both years, while biophysical proxies are only effective predictors in 2009.

The water bodies in Wayanad district improved from 4.30 to 32.68 sq.km due to construction of two dams: Banasurasagar and Karappuzha. However, agricultural crops and paddy field area have decreased by 4.7% in last 14 years. Decreasing rate of agricultural crops can be directly linked to population growth, thereby developing various built-up zones for basic needs. Forest and dense vegetated cover area are increased nearly 2.3 and 3.0%, respectively, during the study period, while bamboo degradation has also been witnessed from 2008 to 2013. The built-up class shows growth from 1.48 to 5.69% of total land area during 2004 and 2018. LULC have noticeable influences on LST with a negative correlation between vegetation cover and LST with a decrease of 1.75oC. The study findings can help the local authorities to implement urban planning regulations for public awareness and policy makers for a sustainable planning and management in forthcoming years.",Land use/land cover,land surface temperature,vegetation indices,,GIS and remote sensing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, cooperation between these communities has been limited. Based on common interests, this work discusses research priorities in representing land use and land-cover change for improved collaboration across modelling, observing and measurement communities. Major research topics in land use and land-cover change are those that help us better understand (1) the interaction of land use and land cover with the climate system (e.g. carbon cycle feedbacks), (2) the provision of goods and ecosystem services by terrestrial (natural and anthropogenic) land-cover types (e.g. food production), (3) land use and management decisions and (4) opportunities and limitations for managing climate change (for both mitigation and adaptation strategies).

This basin, which is shared by China and Kazakhstan, is in the midst of significant socioeconomic transformation due to the collapse of the Soviet Union, the emergence of Kazakhstan, and the economic rise of China. Grazing land covered 82.4% of the IBB in 1995; water bodies and bare land were the only other LULC categories occupying more than 3% of the basin's area. Changes in LULC were most evident on the Chinese side of the border, where crop production areas increased and grazing areas decreased between 1995 and 2015. The area of irrigated cropland in China grew by nearly 30%, primarily in the upper Tekes River valley and along the Ili River near the border with Kazakhstan. In contrast, the irrigated lands in Kazakhstan shifted geographically during this period, but the extent did not change. Expansion of wetlands and permanent water bodies, which occupied 2.1 to 2.9% and 4.6 to 4.7%, respectively, of the IBB in 1995 and 2015, was associated with accretion of Lake Balkhash and Kapchagai Reservoir in Kazakhstan and the construction of new reservoirs in China. NPP of the basin approached 700 g C m(-2)/year in a few areas but was generally less than half this level and characterized by a declining trend except in highly productive irrigated areas of dense, stable vegetation. NPP decreases of more than -10 g C m(-2)/year were apparent in mountainous and upland areas, as well as broad band of grassland and cropland in Kazakhstan.

This study assessed the spatial and areal inconsistencies in the four most recent multiresources land cover products in a complex manner using the common classification systems of International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP)-17, IGBP-9, IPCC-5, and TC (vegetation, wetlands, and others only). Based on inconsistencies and multitemporal land cover datasets, a synthesis of the study was triggered out on land use and land cover dynamics during 2001 to 2017 in the southeastern region of Bangladesh. The overall areal and spatial inconsistencies decreased from high to low levels of aggregation (IGBP-17 to TC), indicating that the inconsistencies are not only influenced by the level of thematic detail and landscape complexity but also related to the conversion uncertainties. Overall, areal inconsistency in the comparison of the FROM-GLC and GlobeLand30 datasets was the smallest among the six pairs, whereas the pair of MODISLC and LULC was observed the highest inconsistencies. Based on an overall lower inconsistencies classification system (IGBP-9), the synthetic land use cover changes in the study area were assessed. During the period of study, the areal distribution of forest cover, built-up areas, and water increased annually by 0.4%, 1.32%, and 0.3% respectively, whereas the croplands and wetlands decreased by 0.5% and 0.3%, respectively. The dynamic changes of croplands, forest, and artificial surface were identified the prime cyclic land cover change.

In this study, we utilized the advantage of land-cover seasonality, canopy height, and spectral characteristics to develop a phenology-based classification model (PCM) for mapping the annual LULCC in our study areas. Monthly analysis of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and near-infrared (NIR) values derived from SPOT images enabled the detection of temporal characteristics of each land type, serving as crucial indices for land type classification. The integration of normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) derived from Landsat images and airborne LiDAR canopy height into the PCM resulted in an overall performance of 0.85, slightly surpassing that of random forest analysis or principal component analysis. The development of PCM can reduce the time and effort required for manual classification and capture annual LULCC changes among five major land types: forests, built-up land, inland water, agriculture land, and grassland/shrubs. The gross change LULCC analysis for the Taoyuan Tableland demonstrated fluctuations in land types over the study period (2013 to 2022). A negative correlation (r = - 0.79) in area changes between grassland/shrubs and agricultural land and a positive correlation (r = 0.47) between irrigation ponds and agricultural land were found. Event-based LULCC analysis for Taipei City demonstrated a balance between urbanization and urban greening, with the number of urbanization events becoming comparable to urban greening events when the spatial extent of LULCC events exceeds 1000 m2.

The present study is based on land-use land-cover changes and urban expansion of megacity Kolkata and its environs over three decades (1991-2018) using multitemporal Landsat data. The study aims to explore and explain the spatio-temporal land-use land-cover change, areal differentiation, spatio-temporal urban growth trajectory and future land-use land-cover prediction with population projection. The spatio-temporal representation found rapid urbanization, i.e. 19% to 57%, exactly three times as in 1991, resulting in significant loss of other than urban/built-up area. Urban trajectory reveals that the expansion mainly occurred in north-east to south-west direction, the zone of both sides of River Hooghly. Areal differentiation map with highest urbanization (3146 ha or UII = 0.64) was identified in the north-north-west part, while least urbanization was identified in the east-north-east direction. On the other hand, this urbanization has grabbed most (i.e. 87%) of the areas within 5-km ring buffer compared to other three ring buffers. Being Kolkata as a traditional city, it has all modern facilities since British rule; as a result, the high population growth and rapid urban expansion were explored in the study. Therefore, urban growth led to radical changes in land-use land-cover, which were witnessed by sharp decreases in sparse vegetation and fallow land. The correlation explained that increasing urbanization has decreased the amount of water body and vegetation. The future prediction graph identified the more horrible picture: the city and its environs will be covered by 67% built-up, while there will be only 3% water body, 14% vegetation and 16% fallow land of the total geographical area with a population (projection) of 28 million in 2051 if it is continued. Such expansion will create a wide range of mismanagement and environmental problems. Hence, the intensive explanation and areal differentiation maps and diagrams prepared using geospatial data will definitely help to understand the urban growth dynamics process and changing form of land-use land-cover and simultaneously decision-making process of the local planners, stakeholders and academicians. Therefore, it also guides to future planning to decrease the adverse effects of urbanization and result in the form of land-use land-cover and makes an eco-friendly megacity as well as sustainable urban development too.",Land-use land-cover,Urban growth,Areal differentiation,,Urbanization,Land-use prediction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the dynamics of land use and land cover in the Matenchose watershed from the years 1991, 2003, and 2020, and future prediction of land use changes for 2050. Landsat TM for 1991, ETM+ for 2003, and Landsat-8 OLI were used for LULC classification for 2020. A supervised image sorting method exhausting a maximum likelihood classification system was used, with the application using ERDAS Imagine software. Depending on the classified LULC, the future LULC 2050 was predicted using CA-Markov and Land Change Models by considering the different drivers of LULC dynamics. The 1991 LULC data showed that the watershed was predominantly covered by grassland (35%), and the 2003 and 2020 LULC data showed that the watershed was predominantly covered by cultivated land (36% and 52%, respectively). The predicted results showed that cultivated land and settlement increased by 6.36% and 6.53%, respectively, while forestland and grassland decreased by 63.76% and 22.325, respectively, from 2020 to 2050. Conversion of other LULC categories to cultivated land was most detrimental to the increase in soil erosion, while forest and grassland were paramount in reducing soil loss. The concept that population expansion and relocation have led to an increase in agricultural land and forested areas was further reinforced by the findings of key informant interviews.

This is the reason why land use change is considered as one of the agriculture-related environmental impacts in a sustainability assessment of food and bio-based products. At the same time, the methodology applied for the quantification of land use change effects is still under intensive research, stimulating scientific discussions. The overall objective of this paper is to fill the gap in knowledge of responsible and sustainable land use management. Specifically, the research provides a comprehensive set of land use change indicators in the context of land use change and land use efficiency. The indicators can be measured based on publicly available databases with the applicability to agricultural sustainability assessment of land use change on a local, regional and global scale. The high share of artificial land and dominant agricultural use of land with low land use intensity were noted in Belgium, Luxemburg, Netherlands, Slovenia, Cyprus, Croatia, Finland, Germany, and United Kingdom. However, land use efficiency was also low. In turn, heterogeneous land cover (but less artificial areas than in other EU countries) and heterogeneous land uses with diverse land use intensity were noted in Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, France, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, and Sweden.

This study aims to reveal the long term land use and land cover changes (from 1939 to 2004) in the Strzelecki Ranges, Victoria, Australia by integrating remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) and to provide quantitative analysis of LUCC information in the area. The land use and land cover is derived from historical aerial photography with the support of Vicmap Elevation, Ecological Vegetation Classes (EVCs) map and stereo models established by using stereo pair of aerial photographs. The EVC map provides a good ground truth not only for the 2004 imagery, but also is part of the reference for interpreting 1988, 1972, 1954 and 1939 orthoimages. The interpretation was carried out with respect to the forest canopy patterns that appeared on the imagery, relationships with other land covers, and DEM derived attributes such as aspects and slope declivity. The results show that land use and land cover in this area changed substantially from 1939 to 2004.

The main reason behind the effects of urban heat island (UHI) is the transformation of land use/land cover, and this transformation is associated with UHI through different actions: i) removal of vegetated areas, ii) land reclamation from sea/river, iii) construction of new building as well as other concrete structures, and iv) industrial and domestic activity. In rapidly developing cities, urban heat island effects increases very hastily with the transformation of vegetated/other types of areas into urban surface because of the increasing population as well as for economical activities. In this research the effect of land use/land cover on urban heat island was investigated in two growing cities in Asia i. e. Singapore and Johor Bahru, (Malaysia) using 10 years data (from 1997 to 2010) from Landsat TM/ETM+. Multispectral visible band along with indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Build Index (NDBI), and Normalized Difference Bareness Index (NDBaI) were used for the classification of major land use/land cover types using Maximum Likelihood Classifiers. On the other hand, land surface temperature (LST) was estimated from thermal image using Land Surface Temperature algorithm. Emissivity correction was applied to the LST map using the emissivity values from the major land use/land cover types, and validation of the UHI map was carried out using in situ data. Results of this research indicate that there is a strong relationship between the land use/land cover changes and UHI. Over this 10 years period, significant percentage of non-urban surface was decreased but urban heat surface was increased because of the rapid urbanization. With the increase of UHI effect it is expected that local urban climate has been modified and some heat related health problem has been exposed, so appropriate measure should be taken in order to reduce UHI effects as soon as possible.",Urban Heat Island,Land Use/Land Cover Changes,Climate Change,EARTH RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMOTE SENSING/GIS APPLICATIONS IV,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Future land-use change in the region could have dramatic impacts on ecological resources and processes. A scenario-based modeling framework is needed to support the analysis of potential land-use change in an uncertain future, and to mitigate potentially negative future impacts on ecosystem processes. We developed a scenario-based modeling framework to analyze potential future land-use change in the Great Plains. A unique scenario construction process, using an integrated modeling framework, historical data, workshops, and expert knowledge, was used to develop quantitative demand for future land-use change for four IPCC scenarios at the ecoregion level. The FORE-SCE model ingested the scenario information and produced spatially explicit land-use maps for the region at relatively fine spatial and thematic resolutions. Spatial modeling of the four scenarios provided spatial patterns of land-use change consistent with underlying assumptions and processes associated with each scenario. Economically oriented scenarios were characterized by significant loss of natural land covers and expansion of agricultural and urban land uses. Environmentally oriented scenarios experienced modest declines in natural land covers to slight increases. Model results were assessed for quantity and allocation disagreement between each scenario pair. In conjunction with the U.S. Geological Survey's Biological Carbon Sequestration project, the scenario-based modeling framework used for the Great Plains is now being applied to the entire United States.

The study then utilised LCM to predict future LULC up to the year 2050 at decadal intervals. The predicted future LULC maps revealed the drastic expansion of built-up; these basins might witness in the coming decades. The built area from 1990 to 2050 is expected to increase to 100.88 km(2) and 60.75 km(2) in Meenachil and Manimala basins, respectively. The agriculture area showed a decrease from 861.7 to 728.29 km(2) in Meenachil and 743.5-676.89 km(2) in Manimala basin. The outcome of the study showed the transformation of the considered land cover classes due to developmental activities in the region. The outcomes of the study can be considered as suitable inputs to land use planners for effective land use planning and management.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
