Firstly, the spatial interaction based on taxi trips between these two commercial districts, acting as either the origins or destinations for taxi trips, with various functional districts was visualized. Subsequently, we analyzed the intensity and distance of the spatial interactions based on taxi trips during each typical time period (8:00-9:00, 18:00-19:00, and 20:00-21:00 on weekdays; and 9:00-10:00, 19:00-20:00, and 22:00-23:00 on weekends).

With the emergence of urban big data and advances in deep learning methods, several studies have leveraged graph convolutional networks (GCNs) with local functional characteristics from points of interest data and spatial features from flow data to infer urban land use. However, these studies cannot distinguish spatial interaction and spatial dependence in terms of conceptualization and modeling mechanisms and overlook the inadequacy of GCNs in modeling spatial interaction. This study proposes a novel framework-a heterogeneous graph convolutional network (HGCN)-to explicitly account for the spatial demand and supply components embedded in spatial interaction data. Several experiments, including 19 different models and datasets from Shenzhen and London, were conducted to validate the proposed framework and its generalizability within the same and different spatial contexts. The HGCN can distinguish heterogeneous mechanisms in supply- and demand-related modalities of spatial interactions, incorporating both spatial interaction and spatial dependence for urban land-use inference. Empowered by HGCN, we found that spatial interaction features play a distinctively crucial role in urban land-use inference compared to local attributes and spatial dependence features. In addition, our findings highlight the superiority of HGCN-based models in boosting performance and enhancing model transferability.",Heterogeneous graph convolutional networks,spatial interaction,urban land-use modeling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Addressing limitations in one-dimensional networks and multivariate issues, the study utilizes spatial density-based hotspot detection approaches and develops a method to identify critical locations as multivariate hotspots. Emphasizing critical locations as foundational units for functional regions, it then addresses spatial interaction data limitations through flexible modeling approaches, enhancing local modeling with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) within Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models.

We present the Contact model to quantify the capacity of diverse urban configurations to foster economic interactions. Employing a network approach, the model simulates potential interactions between residents and retail activities as they move through the city. The model computes the number of shortest paths, weighted by resident density, in a network loaded with retail activities. The method allows for ranking different urban networks based on their potential to stimulate or constrain interactions between inhabitants and retail establishments. The weighted Contact model is tested across various metric radii in a sample of 35 US cities, utilizing population data from US Census Bureau (c2020) and retail data from the ReferenceUSA database (NAICS, c2020). To validate the model, we correlate results with total retail sales data for each city. Our findings reveal that cities with higher weighted Contact values exhibit greater retail sales volume, particularly within smaller radii up to 1000 m. The differences and relevance of this measurement decreases at >1000 m radius showing that the Contact model is relevant at the local level. We conclude that the urban spatial configuration remains to play an important role in the urban economic environment, holding implications for business and service planning, as well as urban planning and design.",Contact model,Urban spatial configuration,Retail,Spatial interaction,US cities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To design policies that can cope with this issue, a comprehensive representation of regional shrinkage patterns needs to be obtained that involves spatial heterogeneity and interaction of shrinking cities at various scales. This study explores the contributing factors of urban shrinkage at different scales and their interaction relationships in Northeast China. The results indicate that painful structural reforms, locational marginalization, and shortage of surplus agricultural labor are the key reasons for the shrinkage of prefecturelevel cities, county-level cities and towns, respectively. Moreover, factors of a city, traditional industries, surplus agricultural labor, educational resources, and geological conditions, can influence the demographic trajectories of cities at other scales through spatial spillover effects. The findings offer a basis for reassessing the conventional wisdom of a simplistic association between identifying scale and urban shrinkage.",Urban shrinkage,Multiscale divergence,Spatial interaction,Mechanism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is little research exploring this relationship in the Chinese context, particularly between locals and migrants in peri-urban China where significant housing is being created. This paper studies the socio-spatial features of neighbourhoods in supporting social interaction between locals and migrants across different neighbourhood types in the peri-urban areas in Guangzhou. In this research, data were collected using door-to-door questionnaires and site surveys in 9 peri-urban neighbourhoods in Guangzhou. The nature and strength of relationships between socio-spatial features of neighbourhoods and social interaction were examined through statistical analysis. The results of this study suggest that the level of maintenance and accessibility can help improve social interaction for locals and migrants living together in villages, redeveloped villages, and commodity housing. Neighbourhood boundaries and quality of neighbourhoods were found to be positively related to social interaction for locals and migrants in redeveloped villages only. In addition, the perceived character of the neighbourhood can positively impact social interaction for locals in villages only. This study demonstrates that high-quality neighbourhoods can improve social interaction between migrants and locals in peri-urban villages, commodity housing, and redeveloped villages in China. The study provides a guide for neighbourhood designers, urban planners, and property managers in periurban China regarding how to create a neighbourhood supporting social interaction between locals and migrants in villages, redeveloped villages and commodity housing respectively.",Socio-spatial features,Social interaction,Locals,Migrants,peri-Urban China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Population mobility networks visually represent urban population mobility, with mobility features and network topology contributing to the quantification of spatial interaction centrality of locations (i. e., geographical nodes). However, existing centrality measures rarely consider mobility features and network topology simultaneously. Centrality quantification also ignores the differences in distance effects between longand short-distance trips. These factors have led to the inaccurate quantification of centrality. We propose an algorithm called k-dis-weight-shell that quantifies the spatial interaction centrality of geographical nodes at different spatiotemporal scales. Considering the different effects of distance on long- and short-distance trips, we use a spatial continuous wavelet transformation to estimate the radiation radius of geographical nodes. Then, by combining network topology with mobility features (mobility distance and flow), the algorithm transforms them into a ranked order of spatial interaction centrality. Tested in Wuhan and Chengdu, our algorithm outperforms six existing benchmarks. For cases in urban planning and epidemic management, results show that k-dis-weightshell effectively distinguishes similarities and differences between the distribution of population mobility's spatial interaction centrality and the urban center hierarchy at a coarse spatiotemporal scale. Additionally, it reveals a double wave phenomenon of spatiotemporal correlation between population mobility and COVID-19 transmission before and after lockdown at a fine spatiotemporal scale.",Urban population mobility,Geographical nodes quantification,Spatial interaction centrality,Urban planning,Emergency management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A comprehensive understanding of the land economic value of urban blue-green spaces (UBGS) holds immense significance for urban sustainable development, urban spatial justice and the promotion of human well-being. In this study, the MGWR model is employed to discuss the heterogeneous effects of UBGS on housing prices in Hangzhou. Additionally, the interaction effect between blue space and green space was examined at the district level, and the specific locations and spatial patterns were identified. The results show that (1) different types, features and accessibility of UBGS have different degrees and spatial scale of effect on housing prices, and will be affected by other attributes of UBGS; (2) in 30.92% of the main urban area of Hangzhou, the effect of blue spaces and green spaces on housing prices exhibits an interactive effect. The spatial patterns are divided into blue-green positive synergistic, antagonistic and negative synergistic regions; (3) green space has positive and negative effects on housing prices, while blue space has positive effects on housing prices at the regional level. The existence of water bodies can promote the positive effect of green spaces on housing prices or alleviate the negative effect. The results indicate that planners must transcend the singular focus on blue or green space planning and instead consider both in an integrated manner.

Previous studies have concentrated on analyzing the spatial distribution of urban services, with less attention on their contribution as local urban amenities. In this study, we propose a spatial dynamic modeling approach based on urban amenities using social media data from Google Place API to provide locational information on potential resident interactions. We use a representative region in Europe (Stockholm County, SE) to simulate and project urban development in the region until 2050. Our circular conceptual framework of spatial information and feedback supports decision-makers in testing possible urban planning scenarios that align with the vision of a smart city. Simulation results reveal the interplay between human-land interactions on a specific spatial-temporal scale, and we analyze scenario outcomes in relation to commercial and residential land uses.

We begin by focusing on the generic spatial interaction model, noting the ways in which its components reflect demand and supply at different locations measured in terms of employment and working population. This suggests an equilibrium structure which is our starting point in developing a simplified version of the model which we extend to deal with four different activity sectors - housing, retail activities, schools, and health facilities. We use this generic structure to develop four related versions of the generic LUTI model equations for residential populations, retailing, education and hospitals which are all driven by employment in terms of where people live and work. This constitutes our integrated framework that we use in calibrating, that is fine-tuning the model to three urban areas (cities) in Europe: to Oxford and its county, Turin and its region, and Athens in its hinterland of Attica reflecting population volumes from 700,000, 1.7 million and 3.8 million persons respectively. In each case, we use the models to predict the impact of different scenarios - new housing developments in Oxfordshire, new universities and metro lines in Turin, and economic development in the Athens region. We describe the details of these scenarios in Supplementary Information (SI) which shows the versatility of using the models to examine such impacts and we conclude with directions for improving the various models and nesting them at different scales within the land use-transport planning process.",Urban modeling,Transport modeling,Land -use transport -interaction modeling,Spatial interaction modeling,Strategic planning,Strategic modeling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have delineated UGBs from the perspective of ecological conservation or efficiency improvement and have widely applied them to spatial planning. However, few studies have investigated the role of urban interactions and connections in delineating UGBs, especially in rapidly developing urban agglomerations. Our study proposed a novel framework for UGBs delineation in urban agglomerations by coupling urban interactions and ecological conservation, with two innovative points. First, interurban interactions and connections were quantified to elucidate the transition rules of cellular automata (CA), and ecological conservation was configured as a constraint of the CA model. Second, the hierarchical generalized linear model (HGLM)-CA model was used to simulate the urban land pattern in 2035, and the dilation-erosion algorithm realized the final UGBs. The proposed framework was applied to UGBs delineation in the Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan (CZX) urban agglomeration, a rapidly developing urban agglomeration in China. Furthermore, a comparison among multi-scenario UGBs shows that urban interactions and connections can accelerate the clustering of urban development, and the delineated UGBs are more practical.

Numerous research has investigated the impact of landscape composition and structure on urban land surface temperature (LST), yet the spatial clustering and heterogeneity between urbanization and the regional thermal environment remained largely unexplored. Here, we analyzed land use dynamics and LST variations in the Guangxi Beibu Gulf urban agglomeration (GBG_UA) from 2000 to 2020. The spatial relationships between urban expansion and the regional thermal environment were explored by bivariate spatial autocorrelation and coupling coordination degree analysis. The results demonstrated that the land use in the GBG_UA remained relatively stable, except for the expansion of developed land in urban centers. The area of heat island zones clearly increased, leading to an enhancement of the UHI effect. Urban development and the regional thermal environment exhibited a robust positive spatial autocorrelation. The H-H (High-High) and L-L (LowLow) types displayed significant aggregation effects. The H-H cluster areas dominated the central urban cores of prefecture-level cities, while the L-L correlation areas were primarily found in mountainous regions. The overall coupling coordination degree was relatively low, with most areas falling into the moderate dissonance level. While it showed a positive shift, with the regions of concordance levels expanding and coupling coordination degree increased. Our study reveals a close spatial correlation between urban sprawl and the UHI effect.

However, the existing framework cannot fully consider spatial interaction or accurately explore the transmission mechanism. To narrow the knowledge gaps, this study provides both theoretical and empirical insights into the impacts of urban expansion on carbon emissions. Based on the panel data of 284 cities in China during 2007-2019, the spatial Durbin model and mediating effect model are primarily utilized to reveal the following results: (i) Urban expansion and carbon emissions show significant spatial heterogeneity, spatial autocorrelation, and spatial spillover. Urban expansion is shifting from a nationwide multi-point distribution to a localized regional distribution, while carbon emissions maintain stable spatial patterns. Urban expansion has U-shaped direct effects on local carbon emissions but inverted U-shaped spatial spillover effects on neighboring cities' carbon emissions. (ii) Industrial structure upgrading and industrial agglomeration are pivotal mediating mechanisms in the relationship between urban expansion and carbon emissions. (iii) Urban expansion is recommended to be limited to a land expansion rate at about twice the population expansion rate.

However, parks are known to be inadequately provided and non-uniformly distributed in cities, leading to an increasing interest to examine spatial equity of park distribution. Such studies have mostly focused on the distributional attributes of park supply in determining spatial equity, while the role of residents' demand is usually ignored or not adequately assessed. In addition, people's preferences for park use were normally ignored and nearest parks were assumed as supplier of park services. Moreover, even though equity assessment is scale-dependent, few studies adopt a multi-scale assessment. We report on a study to address these gaps. A multi scale Supply-Demand Equity Index (SDEI) was developed to assess spatial equity of park distribution from the perspective of supply and demand interactions, and data were collected at a fine scale of neighborhood level. Residents' accessibility to their most often used parks and nearest parks were used to assess and compare supply level; while residents' perceptions obtained from surveys and population density were used to assess and compare demand level. Results showed that supply measured by accessibility to most often used park more accurately reflects supply, and demand assessment on the basis of perception could reflect variations among different social groups and reveal otherwise hidden patterns of spatial inequity. It was also shown that SDEI could identify areas where mismatch between supply and demand occurs. We demonstrated in a single study that different definitions and approaches of quantifying spatial equity can lead to distinct conclusions, therein highlighting that the complex nature of equity requires nuanced approaches and providing a broader view of equity assessment. In addition, the implications of this study for urban park planning and management were highlighted.",Spatial equity,Supply-Demand interactions,Most often used parks,Perceptional demand,Multi-scale analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, few studies have quantitatively examined the spatial stratified heterogeneity (SSH) and driving mechanism of the urban development level (UDL) under different UGPs. Based on the multi-source geographic data of 368 Chinese cities, this study identified the UGP at the patch scale from 2010 to 2020. It furthermore quantified the UDL of newly added construction land. In order to reveal the SSH pattern, motivating factors, and interaction mechanism of the UDL under different UGPs, this paper chose to use the optimal parameter-based geographic detector (OPGD) model, which accounts for the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). The re-sults indicate that: 1) There are significant spatial differences in the UDL among different UGPs. Namely, the infilling pattern exhibits the highest UDL, followed by the edge pattern, and the outlying pattern, which has the worst UDL; 2) The SSH of the UDL is defined by the interaction of multiple factors. Different UGPs have both differences and similarities in their motivating factors, thus affecting the spatial distribution of UDL. GDP density and road network density are the two factors with the strongest driving force for all UGPs. Specifically, the UDL of infilling-expansion areas is more sensitive to the industrial structure and infrastructure conditions. On the other hand, factors such as residential density and socio-economic activities are more important to the UDL of edge-expansion areas, while population, topography, and location factors have a stronger influence on the UDL of outlying-expansion; 3) A change of spatial scale will result in the heterogeneity of the influence of motivating factors in each UGP. In general, the systematic comparison of the SSH and driving mechanism of UDL under different UGPs helps us explore high-quality and sustainable urbanization paths. As a result, this scientific field is given theoretical basis for urban planners and managers to rationally regulate external urban forms and optimize the internal structure layout.",Urban growth pattern,Urban development level,Spatial stratified heterogeneity,Optimal parameter -based geographic detector,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While enabling mapping and visualizing risk patterns at macroscales, this geocentric foundation fails to capture disaster risk dynamics associated with the urban spatial network-an element that plays a significant role in the everyday and emergency functioning of cities, enabling users' movement and interaction. Yet, urban vulnerability assessment overlooks this aspect and thus leaves urban disaster risk mechanisms partially unexplored. This study investigated the role of the network of urban public open spaces (UPOS) in the creation and progression of urban disaster risk in earthquake-prone settlements. Through a multimethod approach that integrates quantitative and qualitative methods and explores spatial configuration, planning policies, and practices of use of UPOS in everyday and emergency scenarios, our study demonstrated that UPOS configuration plays an active role in urban disaster risk. Urban public open spaces impact risk by influencing the exposure of pedestrians and their capacity for self-protection. The study further reconceptualized spatial vulnerability at the urban scale, as the fraction of vulnerability associated to the spatial network, highlighting the interplay of planning policies and spatial practices in its production and progression. Our findings make the notion of spatial vulnerability less ambiguous at the urban scale, by viewing the variable as an imbalance in capacities and exposure that generates spatially unsafe conditions.

Ineffective management of these interactions can result in conflicts, altered animal population dynamics, and increased public and private expenditures. This study presents the Barcelona wild boar (BCNWB)-prototype model, a spatially explicit, incremental agent-based simulation that captures interactions between citizens and wild boar (Sus scrofa) agents in fine-scale GIS-based scenarios in Barcelona. Developed using GAMA software, the model's results were analyzed with QGIS and R software. The model aims to simulate the dynamics of the social-ecological system underlying the urban ecosystem use by synurbic wild boars and their interactions with humans in the (peri)urban area of Barcelona, Spain.The BCNWB-prototype model demonstrated high accuracy in predicting the magnitude and location of wild boar movements (multiple-resolution-goodness-of-fit = 0.73) compared to reported wild boar presences in Barcelona. The model also forecasted 115 attack events and 1,442 direct feeding events during a one-year simulation period, as compared to the actual 150 attacks and 1,858 feeding events reported annually. The model's strong performance highlights its potential as a predictive tool for identifying priority areas for human wild boar interactions and conflicts. Additionally, the model could be employed to assess the cost-effectiveness of management strategies and evaluate the spread, transmission risks, and public health implications of pathogens carried by wild boars.",Agent-based model,Human-wildlife interaction,Spatial-explicit simulation model,Synurbization,Urban ecosystem,Urban wild boar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we proposed a two-layer spatial interaction imputation framework (SIF) for accurate multi-scale spatial interaction imputation. To our knowledge, this is the first time that we impute spatial interactions in multi-scale urban areas.

ANOVA and spatial regression models were used to study the effects of building spatial distribution indicators on the distribution of gaseous pollutants along with their spatial heterogeneity. The results showed that (1) the effects of most of spatial distribution indexes of building on the concentration distribution of the four gaseous pollutants were significant, with one-way ANOVA outcomes reaching a significance level of 0.01 or more.

Therefore, we introduce a new problem of determining multiple interactions among spatial objects to address the challenge of integrating dynamic and spatial impact under interacting sparsity constraints.To tackle this problem, we propose a graph learning solution that leverages an Evolving Graph Neural Network (EGNN) consisting of two collaborative components: a Cross Spatial-Interaction Propagation (CSIP) and an Evolving Self-Supervised Learning (ESSL) module. CSIP enables aggregation within- and propagation across time segments to capture evolving context within a spatial scope from the perspective of message passing between placements.

The main emphasis is on the systematic, spatial, and procedural aspects of urban-rural relations (URRs), aiming to rectify the imbalances and deficiencies in URI development. Through multivariate measurement methods, the study evaluates the functional robustness of the urban-rural system (URS) from perspectives of living, production, and ecology, and distinguishes the degree of interaction and coordination. It introduces a spatial path for URI using module combinations and ""point-axis"" abstract logic. An empirical analysis of China's eastern provinces discloses a noticeable decrease in URS functionality from developed to underdeveloped regions. Although linkage and complementarity between urban and rural areas are significant, mutual promotion and equilibrium between urban and rural production and living functions remain suboptimal. In Shandong Province, the coordination attributes of the three primary URSFs are predominantly characterized by low coordination, an imbalance type of weaker R, and significant urban overshadowing of rural dynamics. Urban-rural synchronous promotion overwhelmingly defines URS functional relationship typologies. The integrated pattern of urban-rural development (URD) after the integration of system functions is a ""point-area"" feature, gradually expanding the scope from the URI model area, the URI pilot area, and the URI transition area to the URI key area, and shows the spatial structural layout of ""two centers, three groups and six circles"". To achieve URI development, comprehensive planning and coordinated promotion of new urbanization and rural revitalization strategies are needed, focusing on micro-level rural regional system issues.

At the same time, digital technology has been continuously applied to the analysis process of the design of the reuse of leftover space. However, the form-oriented approach to digital analysis and application in the design process of leftover spaces has neglected the analysis of the needs of people's activities in the space, resulting in the restriction of people's behaviour in interacting with the space, as well as the weakening of the natural perception and historical and cultural impression of the environment of the reused leftover space.

In many Chinese cities, the planning of rail transit routes and stations is focused on facilitating new developments rather than revitalizing existing built-up areas. This approach reflects the local governments' expectations of substantial growth to reshape the urban structure. However, existing research on transit-oriented development (TOD) rarely explores the spatial interactions between individual transit stations and investigates how they can be integrated to achieve synergistic effects and balanced development. This study proposes that rail transit systems impact urban structure through two ""forces"": the provision of additional and reliable carrying capacity and the reduction of travel time between locations. Metro passenger flow is used as a proxy for these forces, and community detection techniques are employed to identify the actual and optimal spatial clusters in Wuhan, China. The results reveal that the planned sub-centers align reasonably well with the optimal spatial clusters in terms of spatial configuration. However, the actual spatial clusters tend to have longer internal travel times compared to the optimal clusters. Further exploration suggests the need for equalizing land use density within planned spatial clusters served by the metro system. Additionally, promoting concentrated, differentiated, and mixed functional arrangements in metro station areas with low passenger flows within the planned clusters could be beneficial.

The Wuhan metropolitan area, as a rapidly urbanising region, shows clear evidence of different forms of urban fragmentation due to rapid urbanisation and spatial differentiation in pedestrian network structure, neighbourhood residential pattern and land use structure. In this study, an integrated framework for examining the fragmentation of dynamic and complex metropolitan areas, is proposed. The results indicate that the 49 highly fragmented sub-districts are distributed with large gated communities, industrial parks, green spaces and rivers/lakes. The fragmentation forms of the Wuhan metropolitan area include morphological, connectional and functional (variety and conflict) fragmentation, which constitute six scenarios. The geographical detector model manifests that urban fragmentation is the result of natural, socio-economic and construction factors. The increase in spatial debris driven by housing prices (q = 0.334), gross domestic product (q = 0.282), population density (q = 0.359), constructive index (q = 0.292) and road density (q = 0.314) has dramatically affected spatial organisation co-evolution. Additionally, there are synergistic enhancement effects between each pair of driving factors, i.e., bivariate or nonlinear interaction strengthens the impact of each other factor on the index of urban fragmentation. The strongest bivariate interaction is between housing prices and constructive index, with a value of 0.503.

Generalized linear mixed models were used to study associations between the perceived place quality of the respondent-mapped sites and diverse objectively measured UGS characteristics. The presence of blue elements, high forest biodiversity, level of UGS maintenance, and low daytime noise exposure contributed to positive perceptions of UGS quality, while daytime noise exposure and decreasing UGS size were associated with negative perceptions. The model was extrapolated spatially to predict perceived UGS quality across the entire city, revealing local differences in the accessibility of high-quality UGS. The results exemplify how both UGS quantity and quality are relevant for understanding the mechanisms leading to UGS visitation and the health and well-being benefits gained from UGS use and exposure.

The results showed that the spatial regression coefficients between green space and heat islands, PM2.5 concentration and PM10 concentration are significantly negative, - 0.00049***, -0.00329***, and -0.00365*, respectively. The urban green space ecosystems are observed to effectively mitigate the heat island effect and help to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 pollution in winter. There are 88 high-high clustering in the spatial interactions between green space and ozone concentration in summer, that is, the grids with high O3 concentration surrounded by the high green space grids. It implies that urban green space ecosystems can significantly increase O3 pollution in summer. This study reveals that low BVOCs tree species should be widely planted in urban green spaces, while large-scale green space parks should be established in the urban region to continuously increase the proportion of green space. This study would contribute to improving the awareness of the government and relevant employees on scientific urban greening methods.",Green space ecosystem,Spatial econometric regression,Air pollution,Heat island effect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, the spatial differentiation of greenness among major cities of China and its evolution process and drivers are still poorly understood. This study examined the spatial patterns of vegetation greenness across 289 cities in China in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2018 by using spatial autocorrelation analysis on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); then, the influencing factors were analyzed by using the optimal parameters -based geographical detector (OPGD) model and 18 natural and anthropogenic indicators. The findings demonstrated a noticeable rise in the overall greenness of the selected cities during 2000-2018. The cities in northwest China and east China exhibited the rapidest and slowest greening, respectively, among the six sub -regions. A significant positive spatial correlation was detected between the greenness of the 289 cities in different periods, but the correlation strength weakened over time. The hot and very hot spots in southern and eastern China gradually shifted to the southwest. While the spatial pattern of urban greenness in China is primarily influenced by wind speed (WS) and precipitation (PRE), the interaction between PRE and gross domestic product (GDP) has the highest explanatory power. The explanatory power of most natural factors decreased and, conversely, the influence of anthropogenic factors generally increased. These findings emphasize the variations in the influence strength of multiple factors on urban greenness pattern, which should be taken into account to understand and adapt to the changing urban ecosystem.",Vegetation greenness,Spatial heterogeneity,Influencing factors,Geographical detector,Urban areas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on 52 Urban Thermal Heat spots (UTHSs) with significant differences between land use structure and urban green infrastructure (UGI) spatial layout within the influence range of UHI in Shanghai, Landsat-8/9 satellite images were used to construct a high-dimensional dataset reflecting the impact of built environment components on urban thermal environment. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to analyze the spatial difference qualitatively. Using the stepwise regression (SWR) model and partial least square regression (PLSR) model, the complex response relationship between UGI's structure/spatial pattern differentiation and urban thermal environment in three spatial stratification ranges of UTHSs was quantitatively analyzed. Overall, the statistical explanatory power of the PLSR model is much better than the stepwise regression model. The PLSR model points out that moderately increasing the average building height, class area (CA), percentage of landscape (PLAND), landscape shape index (LSI), and largest patch index (LPI) play a positive role in inhibiting the growth of land surface temperature (LST), and the cooling effect of index weights decreases in order. However, the interaction effects of the box-cox transformed indices with underlines, e.g., CA x Cohesion x AI x LPI and PLAND x CA x Cohesion x AI x LPI, exert relatively small weight on the cooling effect.

Despite their hypothesized importance in blackodorous urban rivers, the spatial distribution patterns and roles of cable bacteria in large-scale polluted urban rivers remain inadequately understood. This study examined the diversity and spatial distribution pattern of cable bacteria in sediment samples from 186 black -odorous urban rivers across China. Results revealed the coexistence of two well -characterized cable bacteria (i.e., Candidatus Electrothrix and Candidatus Electronema), with Candidatus Electrothrix exhibiting a comparatively wider distribution in the polluted urban rivers.

Despite an increasing focus on IGS, we are still developing our understanding of the extent to which people use these spaces to interact with nature. Our work addresses this research gap by employing a spatial analysis method to map IGS within Greater Melbourne, Australia. We used citizen science data to analyse the location and density of human-nature interactions on IGS compared to formal green spaces, as well as comparing different types of IGS and formal green spaces.

Recently, a few enhanced GNN architectures have been developed to tackle heterophily graphs where connected nodes are dissimilar. However, urban graphs usually can be observed to possess a unique spatial heterophily property; that is, the dissimilarity of neighbors at different spatial distances can exhibit great diversity. This property has not been explored, while it often exists. To this end, in this paper, we propose a metric, named Spatial Diversity Score, to quantitatively measure the spatial heterophily and show how it can influence the performance of GNNs. Indeed, our experimental investigation clearly shows that existing heterophilic GNNs are still deficient in handling the urban graph with high spatial diversity score. This, in turn, may degrade their effectiveness in urban applications. Along this line, we propose a Spatial Heterophily Aware Graph Neural Network (SHGNN), to tackle the spatial diversity of heterophily of urban graphs. Based on the key observation that spatially close neighbors on the urban graph present a more similar mode of difference to the central node, we first design a rotation-scaling spatial aggregation module, whose core idea is to properly group the spatially close neighbors and separately process each group with less diversity inside. Then, a heterophily-sensitive spatial interaction module is designed to adaptively capture the commonality and diverse dissimilarity in different spatial groups. Extensive experiments on three real-world urban datasets demonstrate the superiority of our SHGNN over several its competitors.",Urban graphs,Spatial heterophily,Graph neural networks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vehicular trajectory prediction at urban intersections remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling temporal dependencies and spatial interactions among traffic agents. This paper proposes a dynamic-learning spatial-temporal Transformer network (DSTTN) with domain adaptation training methods based on two modules for two-dimensional vehicular trajectory prediction at urban intersections. The first module is trajectory maneuver characterization (TMC) which captures latent driving maneuver features and divides trajectory data into different categories with different distributions, which can be regarded as different domains in transfer learning (TL). The second module is trajectory distribution matching (TDM) which adopts a novel spatialtemporal Transformer network with distribution matching loss to dynamically learn domaininvariant maneuvers and achieve accurate trajectory prediction. Experiments and ablation studies collected at two unsignalized urban intersections of the inD dataset first validate the interpretability, transferability, and high prediction accuracy of the proposed DSTTN. The results show that the TMC module has maneuver-representational ability. The proposed STTN achieves good and stable prediction accuracy compared with other baselines, including the state-of-the-art deep learning model, while DSTTN with the TMC and TDM modules further improves accuracy. Additional experiments have been conducted under 70 randomly-selected urban intersection scenarios of the Waymo dataset to validate the good prediction accuracy of the proposed method.

Investigating the seasonal variations in how the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) spatial morphology of urban greenspace (UGS) contributes to mitigating UHI effect in different seasons, which can significantly enhance UGS performance and support urban renewal planning. While previous studies have established the significant influence of urban morphology on UHI effect, there remains a lack of clarity regarding the intricate interplay and combined impacts of UGS landscape patterns (2D), morphological spatial patterns (also 2D in this context), and vegetation height characteristics (3D) on mitigating or exacerbating UHI effect. Therefore, this study develops predictive models to explore the intricate relationships between different modes of UGS spatial morphology-including 2D landscape pattern benchmarks, 2D spatial pattern combinations, and a fusion of 2D and 3D spatial morphology-and surface urban heat island intensity (UHII) across different seasons employing the XGBoost regression model in a case study of the highly urbanized districts of Guangzhou, China. Additionally, a SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm for comprehensive analysis was employed to gain insights into the nonlinear effects of different metrics on surface UHII within these diverse modes. The results revealed that: (1) In the benchmark mode, G_LPI and G_PD had a positive impact on mitigating surface UHII across all seasons. The G_COHESION in summer and G_LSI in spring, autumn, and winter also demonstrated significant cooling effects. (2) In the 2D spatial pattern combination mode, CORE, EDGE, BRANCH, and G_PD significantly affected surface UHII. Increasing the number of UGS spatial pattern metrics did not correspondingly increase the number of main metrics influencing surface UHII, indicating that 2D UGS spatial pattern had limited effectiveness in mitigating surface UHII. (3) In the 2D and 3D spatial morphology combination mode, the marginal impact of main metrics on surface UHII is particularly significant across seasons. TGI, CORE, MVH, G_PD, and EDGE generally demonstrated strong cooling effects. During summer and autumn, 3D metrics had a more pronounced impact on reducing surface heat accumulation, while in spring and winter, 2D metrics played the most critical role in mitigating the spread of local heat sources. (4) Even after controlling for urban morphology, UGS spatial morphology still significantly influenced the urban thermal environment across different seasons. When developing urban renewal strategies, it is essential to prioritize the impact of main UGS spatial morphology metrics and focus on diversification of marginal effects of these metrics. This approach will help ensure that UGS can provide more stable and enduring regulation of the local microclimate.

Understanding the spatial heterogeneous driving forces of urban waterlogging,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,OCT 10 2023,16,"Urban waterlogging seriously threatens urban sustainable development and human life. The effects of various landscape elements on urban waterlogging have been extensively documented. However, less attention is deserved to the spatial heterogeneity effects of urban landscape elements on urban waterlogging. The spatial pattern of dominant driving forces and how the interactive effects of landscape elements affect urban waterlogging with different environmental configurations have not been well examined. These shortcomings have hindered the development of target-specific urban waterlogging mitigation strategies. To shed some light on this topic, an innovative method that integrated the boruta algorithm, cubist regression tree, and geographical detector model is presented to investigate the spatial heterogeneous mechanisms of urban waterlogging and map the waterlogging dominant driving forces with different local conditions. The results show that the boruta algorithm proposed in this study introduces shadow variables as a benchmark, thus enabling an unbiased and stable selection of representative waterlogging driving factors based on local conditions. By comparing with two other commonly used regression methods (global regression model, spatial lag model), the cubist regression tree divides the urban waterlogging space into multiple homogeneous subgroups to quantify the spatial nonstationarity relationship and spatially explicit the local driving forces in Guangzhou and Shenzhen, with the adjusted R2 of 0.79 and 0.88. The geographical detector model denotes that waterlogging magnitude within different subgroups is affected by different dominant factors. Even for the same dominant factor, its contribution to waterlogging varies considerably in different subgroups. The independent contribution of the dominant factor in Guangzhou was 23.28%-57.82%, while in Shenzhen it ranged from 25.95% to 53.59%. In addition to the dominant factor of each subgroup, it is noteworthy that in some subgroups the combined effect of different representative factors on waterlogging is significantly stronger than the contribution of their dominant factors. In view of this, urban planners and local authorities need to comprehensively consider the interaction effect between representative factors, which develop urban waterlogging mitigation strategies that integrate multiple factors. The results from this study extend our scientific understanding of the site-specific mechanism of urban waterlogging, which facilitates the implementation of more targeted and effective mitigation strategies, rather than a ""one-size-fits-all"" policy.",Urban waterlogging,Spatially heterogeneous driving forces,Spatial non-stationarity relationship,Cubist regression tree,Geographical detector model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They provide a close-up perspective of the urban physical environment, allowing a comprehensive perception and understanding of cities. There has been a significant amount of effort to represent the urban physical environment based on street view imagery, and this representation has been utilized to study the relationships between the physical environment, human dynamics, and socioeconomic environments. However, there are two key challenges in representing the urban physical environment of streets based on street-view images for downstream tasks. First, current research mainly focuses on the proportions of visual elements within the scene, neglecting the spatial adjacency between them. Second, the spatial dependency and spatial interaction between streets have not been adequately accounted for. These limitations hinder the effective representation and understanding of urban streets. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic graph representation framework based on dual spatial semantics. At the intra-street level, we consider the spatial adjacency relationships of visual elements. Our method dynamically parses visual elements within the scene, achieving context-specific representations. At the inter-street level, we construct two spatial weight matrices by integrating the spatial dependency and the spatial interaction relationships. It could account for the hybrid spatial relationships between streets comprehensively, enhancing the model's ability to represent human dynamics and socioeconomic status. Furthermore, aside from these two modules, we also provide a spatial interpretability analysis tool for downstream tasks. A case study of our research framework shows that our method improves vehicle speed and flow estimation by 2.4% and 6.4%, respectively.

The feasibility of the method was confirmed by this case study, which shows that it improves the simulation accuracy of the urban agglomeration scale, particularly for central cities. We identified the urban gravitational field and ecological constraints as two important factors affecting the expansion of urban agglomerations.

It is of great significance to investigate the intrinsic interaction between the TSDI and the CDCC. Identifying the disaster risks induced by the intensity of the territorial spatial development and their constraints promotes synergistic development to cope with the uncertainty. The study explored the degree of coupling, the level of coordinated development, and the dynamic development trend between TSDI and CDCC from the perspective of coupling coordination. Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) Region was used as a case study and it was found 1) there is a higher degree of coupling, and high correlation between TSDI and CDCC in the BTH urban agglomeration region; 2) the BTH region has the highest number of cities with coordination levels on the verge of maladjustment, followed by ones with barely coordinated cities; 3) while the overall level of coordination gradually increases, the overall deviation degree of development of TSDI and CDCC in the BTH urban agglomeration region is gradually decreasing; 4) there is an interactive coercion relationship between TSDI and CDCC in the BTH urban agglomeration region. This study may help provide a decision-making basis for the BTH urban agglomeration on improving the pertinence of urban disaster prevention and mitigation construction, adjusting the spatial structure of the national territory, and promoting the coordinated development of different cities. Moreover, technical support and theoretical guidance for similar regions was also developed to assess the land suitability, establish an integrated defense system of the national territory and space, and exercise resilient city planning.",Territorial spatial development intensity,Comprehensive disaster-carrying capability,Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration,Dynamic coupling coordination,Interactive coercion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to increase expert engagement with the Bayesian-based decision support model in evaluating urban vibrancy decisions. In this study, urban vibrancy parameters are defined using ""economic, use, and image value"" measures. This article focuses on the visual aspect of vibrancy, defined as the image value of place. The image value is evaluated through likability and likability features. The case study area is the Eminonu Central Business District in the Istanbul Historic Peninsula due to its distinctive urban dynamics derived from the duality of being a cultural and cosmopolitan city center. This research presents a method as a decision support system (DSS) model based on the Bayesian belief network (BBN) and spatial BBN for supporting urban vibrancy decisions. The spatial BBNs monitor spatial outcomes of variables' dependencies that form through the BBN relationship network. Spatial BBN tools monitors the spatial impact of decisions for informed urban interventions. The results demonstrate that urban greening, pedestrianization, and human-scaled streetscapes should be prioritized to make streets more likable. The most significant intervention areas are Tahtakale for signboard regulation, Sultanahmet and Vefa for cultural landscape improvement, and Vefa and Mahmutpasa for planning building enclosures. The participation is achieved by evaluating urban vibrancy with what-if scenarios using BBN. The developed DSS model addresses which parameters should be prioritized, and what are their spatial consequences. The use of spatial BBN tools presents certain limitations in terms of interoperability and user interaction. Overall, this research contributes to participatory urban planning by incorporating both conditional and spatial dependencies.

Agents within the model are characterized by distinct preferences for these hubs, guiding their movement decisions and thereby influencing the spatial configuration of the city. The model reflects the richness of urban life by capturing the intricacies of preference-based residential choices. Through integration of a survey-based approach, the study sources simulated agents' decision behaviors from real-world data, ensuring a realistic portrayal of urban dynamics. Our findings demonstrate how individual desires, such as the desire for economic stability, educational opportunities, cultural experiences, and environmental quality, combine with social factors to promote urban segregation in complex ways.

Amid rapid urbanization, maintaining and expanding green spaces has become increasingly challenging, especially in densely populated urban centers. This research utilizes remote sensing data and Point of Interest (POI) data to assess how different types of urban amenities influence UGS dynamics based on geospatial analytics. The study focuses on the central districts of Guangzhou, a city facing significant urban development pressures, to provide a nuanced understanding of these interactions. Employing both Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression and Random Forest (RF) models, the analysis examines the impact of 23 categories of POIs on the spatial and temporal changes in UGS. Key findings reveal that amenities such as auto repair shops, shopping services, and transit facilities are negatively correlated with UGS, indicating that their presence may contribute to the reduction in green space. Conversely, amenities like scenic spots and life services show a positive correlation, suggesting they might support the preservation or expansion of green spaces. The results underscore the dual role of urban amenities in both supporting and constraining green space development, highlighting the need for carefully balanced urban planning strategies.

However, existing research rarely applies these spatial non-stationarity features to fine-scale zoning controls, reducing the applicability of zoning results and limiting the refined development of territorial space. This is essential for high-quality development of territorial space in urban-rural transitional areas with rapid land use function transitions. Taking the region between the first and second bypass expressways of Hangzhou as an example, this research identified and measured the spatial non-stationarity characteristics of the trade-off/synergy among different function changes from a production-living-ecological function perspective during 2010-2020. A territorial space zoning control framework from the grid scale to the township scale, which considered the spatial non-stationarity of trade-offs/ synergies and the dominant land use functions, was constructed to support synergistic territorial space development in urban-rural transitional areas. The results demonstrated that the trade-off/synergy among distinct function changes during 2010-2020 had significant spatial heterogeneity and gradient characteristics. The interaction between living function and other functions showed an increasing trade-off, while that between production and ecological functions varied from trade-off to synergy. These interrelationships produced six spatial non-stationarity forms, which exhibited obvious spatiotemporal differences in different trade-off/synergy bundles. 12 territorial spatial functional zones at the grid scale and 5 dominant functional zones at the township scale were subdivided for territorial spatial management.

This study takes the Beibu Gulf urban agglomeration, a national-level model area for integrated land and sea development in China, as an example to investigate the spatial heterogeneity of CLIU and explore its driving factors through multiple econometrical and geographical methods, including identifying its underlying mechanisms. The results indicate that (1) the CLIU index is 0.334, its Gini coefficient is 0.183, and its comprehensive level has a low intensity and obvious spatial nonequilibrium characteristics.

Concurrently, we selected environmental, spatial structure, and housing economic indicators to construct a regression analysis. Our findings revealed that urban villagers exhibit a preference for shorter daily commutes, underscoring the positive role of UVs in promoting job-housing balance and providing diverse services. The high-frequency mobility of villagers accelerates the categorization of UVs and enhances intra-area circulation. We further discussed the interaction between UV renewal and its destigmatization. To counter spatial stigmatization, enhancing the spatial quality and infrastructure of UVs, as well as promoting diversified land use can reduce the public's stereotypical impressions. Moreover, prioritizing affordable housing and equitable distribution of facilities, along with fostering synergies between urban capital and UVs, can facilitate the destigmatization process.

Second, a spatial simultaneous equation model (SSEM) was employed to examine the interactive feedback between UCL and RCL transitions in Jiangsu Province, China, from 2000 to 2020. The main findings were as follows: The interactive feedback between UCL and RCL transitions followed two paths. The first interactive feedback path was driven by the interaction of urban and rural factors, whereas the second was driven by the integrated management of urban and rural land. UCL and RCL transition witnessed a positive interactive feedback relation. Specifically, a 1% increase in UCL transition led to a 0.535% increase in RCL transition, and a 1% increase in RCL transition resulted in a 0.579% increase in UCL transition. The two aspects exhibited complex spatial interaction effects. The UCL transition in the subject city had positive and negative effects on the UCL and RCL transitions of neighboring cities, respectively.

Therefore, the churches constructed by Christian missionary societies in Canton merit particular attention in missionary history research and urban planning history. Based on local gazetteers, historical maps, export paintings, Western travelogues, and archives at that time, from a cultural landscape perspective, this article compares and analyzes the spatial expansion of Christian churches and their influences on the urban landscape in Canton in two stages. In the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, the spatial layout of the churches indicated an active integration into Canton City. After the Opium War, churches were not only used for religious purposes but also served as symbols asserting the presence of Christians and Western powers (which made the situation more complicated). Missionary societies attracted believers through the construction of public facilities, building Christian communities centered around churches, thereby competing with authorities for spatial power and influencing the urban functional system and spatial layout controlled by the authorities.

Results showed that urban forest evolution was spatiotemporally coupled with the patterns of PM2.5, SUHI, and carbon stock in 2000-2020. 80 % of the urban forest landscape indices demonstrated significant positive effects on cooling-clean air-increase carbon sequestration, with much higher (on average 2.98 times) influence than for each single environmental variable. In addition, patch dominance explained an average of 60.55 % of the synergistic effects, and its control zone rapidly expanded spatially by 54.3 %. In contrast, the influence of cover rate diminished, with q value and control zone proportion decreasing by 18.87 % and 26.61 %. Moreover, the contributions of anthropogenic factors to synergistic effects were 1.2-3.8 times higher than the natural factors.

In this study, we examine which factors should be used to distinguish impedance functions for use. Using data from a large national travel survey, we first show that the impedance curves are well approximated by functions of the exponential family and the related Tanner function. We use two methods - variable-wise function fit and Shapley additive explanations - to conclude the importance of four factors for developing impedance functions. These are travel mode, trip purpose, urbanity class of trip origin and destination, and the socioeconomic status grouping of the travelers. We then show that the use of a generalized impedance function can significantly over- or underestimate spatial accessibility compared to factor-specific impedance function, with up to 80 % overestimation on average in the case of public transit and 16 % overestimation for low socio-economic status travelers.

It aimed to recognize the specific influence of urban morphology and the spatial patterns of flooding risk agglomeration under different rainfall scenarios in high-density urban areas. The XGBoost model demonstrated enhanced accuracy and robustness relative to other three benchmark models: RF, SVR, and BPDNN. This superiority was effectively validated during both training and independent testing in Shenzhen. The results indicated that urban 3D morphology characteristics were the dominant factors for waterlogging magnitude, which occupied 46.02 % of relative contribution. Through PDP analysis, multi-staged trends highlighted critical thresholds and interactions between significant indicators like building congestion degree (BCD) and floor area ratio (FAR). Specifically, optimal intervals like BCD between 0 and 0.075 coupled with FAR values between 0.5 and 1 have the potential to substantially mitigate flooding risks. These findings emphasize the need for strategic building configuration within urban planning frameworks. In terms of the spatial-temporal assessment, a significant aggregation effect of high-risk areas that prone to prolonged duration or high-intensity rainfall scenarios emerged in the old urban districts. The approach in the present study provides quantitative insights into waterlogging adaptation strategies for sustainable urban planning and design.",Flooding susceptibility assessment,Urban morphology,XGBoost,Interpretation algorithm,Spatial agglomeration analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigate the key factors influencing warehouse selection while accounting for spatial spillover effects (i.e., co-locational relationships), using data from 2003 to 2016. A major finding is that different types of business establishments exert distinct influences on warehouse location choice, varying across spatial scales. Notably, the effects from neighboring spatial units sometimes diverge from the direct impacts. For instance, manufacturing establishments have a positive direct influence on warehouse location choice in all three study areas, while neighboring manufacturing units show negative effects in Austin and Dallas. The analysis also highlights that when spatial interactions among e-commerce facilities, logistics businesses, and supply chain entities in adjacent units are accounted for, several transportation infrastructure and socioeconomic factors lose their statistical significance.

The structure of these networks both reflects and influences how cities are lived in, perceived and planned. In this study, location tracking data from mobile phones were used to investigate the functional and spatial structures of daily mobility networks and how these networks change as they grow in size. A case study was performed on 81 Spanish functional Urban Areas (FUAs). The results of this study show that the friction of the space and the average length of the aggregate daily mobility are constant and do not depend on the area and demographic size of the FUAs. The average length of the aggregate daily mobility is associated with the increase in complexity that occurs as mobility networks grow, which is reflected in an increase in the number of levels of interaction and the proportion of local flows that integrate adjacent spaces across different scales. The method used provides quantitative indicators that reveal the similarities and differences of daily mobility, as well as the interactions that occur in FUAs according to their size.

The study analyzes factors driving RULD changes through actors' practices, attributing differences to globalization timing, land rights consciousness, and resulting path dependencies. These elements have shaped political-commercial alliances and land development norms, leading to inconsistent RULD over time. Two key arguments emerge: First, contemporary RULD divergence stems from socioeconomic transitions, distinct from environmental constraints in agrarian societies. Second, this divergence reflects cross-scale state- market-society interactions at the macro level, while resulting from multi-scale actor negotiations at the micro level.

The location of financial outlets is usually determined on the basis of factors such as population density, commercial areas, residential areas and transportation convenience. As an important carrier of urban financial services, the rationality of the layout of financial outlets can reflect the financial needs and behavioral patterns of people in the city. Urban functional area is a product after urbanization, different from urban land use type which focuses on the classification of urban land use through natural conditions, urban functional area mainly analyzes the internal spatial structure of the city, focusing on the discernment of the dominant functions within the built-up area of the city. By categorizing urban functions such as residence, commercial service and industry, the spatial distribution of urban functions can be grasped to provide support for urban planning and development. Urban functional areas can reveal human behavior patterns, needs and preferences in different areas. The current research on financial outlets mainly focuses on the accessibility and coverage of financial outlets, and researchers treat financial outlets as spatially undifferentiated points, ignoring the problem of spatial heterogeneity of financial outlets within different functional zones. When studying the rationality of the layout of urban financial outlets, considering different functional zones within the city can better meet the financial needs of residents, enterprises and institutions in the region and improve the accessibility and convenience of financial services. Analyzing the comprehensive service capacity of financial outlets within different functional areas is obviously insufficient in the current study, which is not conducive to the configuration planning of financial outlets and the promotion of the accessibility of urban financial services. The wide application of Point of Interest (POI) data in spatial analysis provides a new perspective for the study of urban financial outlets, for this reason, this paper analyzes and researches the current situation and rationality of the spatial layout of financial outlets based on POI data, under the perspective of the functional areas of the city, and combined with the population travel vitality index. The Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm is used to process the POI data to generate the urban functional area, on the basis of which the travel vitality index in the city is calculated by combining the population coverage and road network density, so as to judge the reasonableness of the layout of urban financial outlets. This helps us to better understand the behavioral decision-making process and social interaction of human beings about financial life in the city, and provides guidance and decision-making support for urban financial layout planning, financial public services and financial policies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, traditional urban thermal environment assessments typically relied on simple linear integration of associated indicators, often neglecting the spatial interaction effect. To explore the spatial interaction among the three elements, this study proposes an accessibility -based urban thermal environment assessment framework. Using Zhengzhou, a rapidly urbanizing city, as an example, remotely sensed images from three periods (2010, 2015 and 2020) were applied to extract urban green space (UGS) and hot island area (HIA). An improved two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method and bivariate local Moran's I were employed to explore whether residents' clustering locations are more likely to access cooling service or to be exposed to heat risk. The results demonstrate that the UGS in the city has been expanding, whereas the HIA shrank within the inner city in 2015 and then increased in 2020. Even though the urban thermal environment may have improved in the last decade, the spatial interaction among the residents, cooling service and heat risk area could be exacerbated. Spatial autocorrelation shows an increase in locations that are disadvantageous for resident congregation. Even when sufficient cooling services were provided, residents in these areas could still be exposed to high heat risk. The developed urban thermal environment framework provides a novel insight into the residents' heat risk exposure and cooling service accessibility, and the findings could assist urban planners in targeting the improvement of extra heat exposure risk locations.",Urban heat island,Urban green space,Accessibility,Remote sensing,Spatial autocorrelation analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study addresses this critical gap by developing an innovative model that couple's population-land simulation with macro and micro data for more sustainable urban land planning. Our method employs pre-simulated urban land data and leverages existing population data, while utilizing Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) sub-modules to accurately simulate crucial urban land development decision-making processes, including job location selection, commuting preferences, and choices of residential locations. These sub-modules are adept at reflecting natural limitations and capturing the socio-economic interactions of both working and non-working residents in urban settings. At the macro-scale, the Geographic Micro-process Model (GMP) assesses spatial variations in urban population and land. To optimize population distribution, our model incorporates controls that leverage social networking effects and urban capacity constraints at the micro-scale. Furthermore, by exploring the coupling relationship between urban population and land using the GMP model, our study has predicted population distribution under various land expansion scenarios (Compact, Sprawl and Stable). The application of this model in Wuhan, China, shows good convergence with the Curve Discrepancy Index (CDI), achieving a Pixel-level Precision Value (PPV) of 0.7466 and Elastic Tolerance Index (ETI) values of 0.9109, 0.9061, and 0.8846, with corresponding tolerance coefficients of 0.2, 0.1, and 0.01, demonstrating the overall robustness and reliability of our model.

However, little is known about heterogenous patterns with respect to the multi-dimensional contexts of cities, especially from spatially-explicit and system-integrated perspectives. Here, we developed two spatial trajectory models (exponential and logistic function) from a geographic-process view to quantify spatial gradient patterns of economic-population-air quality nexus along urban development intensity (UDI), and explored their interactions from archetypal analysis that combines static spatial gradient patterns and change magnitude of essential attributes (i.e., background baseline, concentration level) across 32 major cities in China. We found nighttime light intensity and population density experience an accelerated exponential increase, whereas most of PM2.5 concentrations tend to grow in an S-shape manner along a rising UDI gradient. And the evolution dynamics of these three elements are not consistently matched in spatial distribution and aggregation patterns during 2000-2018. Specifically, although the higher economic baseline and more balanced pattern of all the typical 32 cities have been relatively widely achieved during the nearly past two decades, over 80% of sample cities are still currently facing a declining baseline and more concentration level of population density. And nearly half of the cities tend to follow a path of generating PM2.5 pollution that transgressed the Level II concentration threshold of China Ambient Air Quality Standard (GB3095-2012) (>35 mu g center dot m (-3)) when accompanied by a slightly enhanced spatial aggregated pattern. In terms of archetypal analysis of 32 cities, six regime shifts provide new insights into the prevalence of trade-offs and synergies between urban economicpopulation-air quality nexus along urbanization levels, basically following the hierarchy and adaptive cycle pathways. Therefore, these new insights into micro- and macro- city analysis allow for spatial refinement of urban internal structure and identifying specific challenges to inform target spatial management for ongoing desirable trajectories towards sustainable urban development.",A geographic-process perspective,Spatial trajectory models,Urban development intensity gradients,Economic-population-air quality nexus,Archetype analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four key ESs in 2000, 2010, and 2020: water yield (WY), carbon storage (CS), habitat quality (HQ), and soil retention (SR) were evaluated by using the InVEST model. Then the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) method was applied to optimally allocate ESs trade-offs and identify ecological priority protection areas (EPPAs). Finally, the PLUS model was used to simulate urban growth scenarios under different levels of ESs protection constraints and propose spatial planning strategies. The results revealed the following. (1) From 2000 to 2020, the three ESs (i.e., WY, CS, and HQ) exhibited the spatial distribution pattern with high in the east and low in the west, and higher in the woodland than in built-up areas, except SR, which remained at a weak level throughout the region.

We investigated the potential role that urban gulls play in the spread and dispersal of these bacteria. We analysed 129 faecal swabs from yellow-legged gulls (Larus michahellis) of different ages (56 adults and 73 im-matures) during the breeding period from three years in the highly populated city of Barcelona (northeastern Spain). Thirteen individuals tested positive for the pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni), including antibiotic-resistant strains. We modelled the potential spatial spread of pathogens using the GPS trajectories of 58 yellow-legged gulls (23 adults, 35 immature individuals), which included the thirteen individuals that tested positive for pathogenic bacteria. By overlapping the spatially explicit path-ogen dispersal maps with the distribution of urban installations sensitive at risk of possible pathogen spillover (e. g. elder and medical centres, markets, food industries, kindergartens, or public water sources), we identified potential areas at risk of pathogen spillover. Pathogens may be potentially spread to municipalities beyond Barcelona city borders. The results revealed that immature gulls dispersed pathogens over larger areas than adults (maximum dispersal distances of 167 km versus 53.2 km, respectively). Recreational urban water sources were the most sensitive habitats visited by GPS-tagged gulls that tested positive, followed by schools. Combining GPS movement data with pathogen analytics allows spatially explicit maps to be generated using a One Health approach that can help urban and public health management within large cities, such as Barcelona, and identify areas used by humans that are sensitive to pathogen spillover from gulls.",Urban ecology,Disease,Yellow-legged gull,GPS tracking,Epidemiology,Antibiotic resistant pathogens,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, advanced spatial analysis is increasingly employed for identifying urban types, as it offers an analytical approach to analyze urban form. This research aims to: 1/ explore the types of urban form (i.e. streets, buildings, land uses) in Athens using an open-data methodological framework that incorporates clustering and spatial analysis, 2/ assess the validity and value of the methodology and its results as research output and as a potential planning support tool via spatial virtual focus groups with 20 local experts from the fields of typo-morphology, urban planning, sustainable mobility, urban geography, and urbanism in general. The results, as evaluated by the expert focus groups, show that the methodology successfully describes the diverse character of Athens at the neighbourhood level, while it is helpful in the first stages of planning interventions. A vital aspect of this research is the exclusive use of open datasets readily available for European cities, resulting in a replicable methodology for comparatively analyzing the urban form of European cities. Another contribution is conceptualising a spatially-enabled focus group facilitating interaction among a diverse panel of experts related to the multidisciplinary field of urban morphology.

The spatial correlation method used was exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) with the Moran index and local indicator space association (LISA). In the analyzed municipalities, the urban green spaces are not mostly concentrated in areas with better social indices. In four MR, the most representative scenario (in terms of area), was the high social vulnerability accompanied by a high number of urban green spaces. This scenario was observed in peri-urban zones in the analyzed MR. The Distrito Federal (containing the national capital, Brasilia) was the only one case where the concentration of green spaces appeared in the most socially privileged areas. Regarding the most representative scenario, the major problem is not the lack of urban green spaces but the absence of a policy for the implementation of complementary urban facilities in such green spaces. These policies are fundamental for turning urban green spaces into places for social interaction, land-scape contemplation, leisure, and culture. Therefore, in the context of land use policies, when green spaces are included among the set of the urban facilities, they become promoters of environmental and spatial justice and can reduce inequality in cities.",Spatial correlation,ESDA,Moran index,LISA,Spatial inequality,Environmental justice,Urban facilities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The dominant influencing factors of GVI were analyzed and screened by applying the Pearson correlation coefficient and optimal parameters-based geographical detector (OPGD). The results showed that the overall GVI was high in the study area, with an average value of approximately 28%. The scale effect of GVI was not obvious, but the spatial heterogeneity was distinct, and the hot spots and cold spots of GVI had an evident clustered distribution. The spatial variation of GVI was influenced by the vegetation cover, landscape pattern, built environment and socioeconomic factors.

In this paper, we provide a systematic review of urban models, including the evaluation, classification, application of urban models, and the timeline of urban models' development. According to their modelling styles and applications, urban models can be classified into three categories: aggregate static models of economic and spatial interaction, urban dynamics models, and behavioural models of individual agents which linked to spatial location. According to the different modelling methods, urban models can be classified into two categories: top-down and bottom-up. Nowadays, emerging technologies, especially Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), are gradually but significantly changing the organization form of urban economic activities. It enables regions to break the location limitation and join in the national even global industry division, and that triggers a new bottom-up rural urbanization process, which formed a significant challenge for urban models.

Multi-schemes of spatial adjacencies among the subdistricts and towns have been devised to probe into the differences in their synergies and cooperations in developing land. Land development intensity gauged by the proportion of construction land has shown great spatial heterogeneity between subdistricts and towns, with a high impervious and urbanized land proximate to the urban center. Spatial interaction is more pronounced when two subdistricts are adjacent in the same municipality and is the least powerful when the subdistrict is adjacent to the town, verifying the close horizontal relationships of the local governments, as well as the administrative barriers at the different administrative ranks in the spatial governance system. In addition, local socio-economic development and the locational preferences for political centers and medical facilities have been identified as important influencing factors.

In this paper, we developed and applied social-ecological network analysis to assess peri-urban forests management in the Guanzhong Plain urban agglomeration area. Exponential random graph models and multilevel networks were used to assess the structural characteristics and evolution of the peri-urban forest social-ecological network in 2010 and 2020.

Effective heat reduction and adaptation strategies rely on a thorough understanding of urban heat island (UHI) dynamics, which vary within cities and over time due to local urban form and meteorological conditions. While existing studies have examined the spatiotemporal structure of UHIs, they have not examined the space-time variability of air temperature at high spatial and temporal resolutions. This study addresses this gap by utilizing a ground-based sensor network of 53 iButton thermochrons, synoptic weather stations, and satellites to capture these spatiotemporal patterns. Using these data, we developed generalized additive models to predict daily, daytime and nighttime air temperature anomalies throughout Baltimore City. We found that 1) meteorological variables are more influential in characterizing the nighttime UHI than the daytime UHI; 2) spatiotemporal variability of nighttime UHIs is greatest in areas with sparse vegetation canopy cover; and 3) interactions between urban form and meteorology have a systematic but modest impact on the spatial structure of UHIs.

In this study, we investigate the impact of urban sprawl in Flanders on the spatial variation of the quality and cost structure of various services that are provided at home or near homes. Based on a literature review and expert interviews, we collected data with the aim of modelling such cost structures, in particular of local and regional public transport, household waste collection, and postal and parcel services. The findings differ between the various services studied. For public transport, sprawl has hardly any impact on the operational expenses and on the price charged to the traveler, but it does have a direct impact on the quality of the service. In the case of waste collection, differences in operational expenses are consolidated at the level of the collection round or collector, and differences in price or quality are hardly or not at all noticeable by the consumer. Universal postal services are tightly regulated, and consolidate operational expenses at the national level, as a result of which customers do not experience price differences, although they do face differences of distance to access points. These findings indicate that the density of address points along road segments are key to cost effectiveness of home-delivered services. Two new sprawl indicators are proposed for mapping urban sprawl, allowing to model the impact on the provision of various services: the average number of address points per kilometer mapped per road segment, and the inversion, i.e. average road distance between address points mapped per address point of a road segment. The data and models are intended to nourish the debate of whether or how spatially varying costs should be passed on to customers, and allow working towards solutions that serve a more sustainable interaction between urbanization and supply of services.",Urban sprawl,Public transport,Waste collection,Postal services,Flanders,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address this problem, we propose a POI-flow interaction based spatial-temporal framework (PFIST) for long-term crowd flow prediction. First, we model the long-term evolution representations of crowd flow and POI distribution. Then we study the dynamic interaction between POI transition patterns and crowd flow variation on different POI periods and categories. Afterwards, we decompose the flow sequence into long-term trend and daily variation parts and apply the normalized POI-flow interaction attention to the long-term trend parts.

Studies quantifying disaster resilience commonly focus on evaluating physical performance of infrastructure systems, often cannot capture their capacity that maintain available service to meet citizens' demands. This paper proposes a flowbased framework for quantitively measuring resilience by regarding changes in service availability to critical facilities as a primary measurement outcome. Through the utilization of multilayer networks, we effectively incorporate diverse datasets pertaining to population demographics, residential areas, critical facilities, and the roadway network. This integration enables us to simulate the intricate dynamics of public service flows within dynamic urban systems, thereby evaluating resilience levels and accurately mapping the spatial distribution patterns. The methodology was validated in Shanghai by quantifying regional variations in healthcare services under pluvial flood scenarios. The research findings highlight the heterogeneous redistribution of service flows during extreme events, leading to spatial variations in resilience outcomes, irrespective of the proximity to hazard-prone areas. The spatial clustering of vulnerable communities demonstrates a close association with mobility correlation patterns, which are strongly influenced by the distribution of facilities and the connectivity of the road network. Thus, using the framework offers valuable insights into risk mitigation and planning of critical facilities in extreme situations.

However, the factors determining the spatial distribution of online-to-offline food delivery restaurants (O2O-FDR) and the effects (e.g., dietary health) they cause are poorly understood. This study explored the differences in spatial patterns and influencing factors between O2O-FDR and conventional restaurants (CR) accessibility in Nanjing, as well as the driving mechanisms for the food environment. The results show that (1) O2O-FDR accessibility and CR accessibility both have a centrally distributed pattern, while O2O-FDR accessibility is smaller and more dispersed. (2) O2O-FDR shows a clear economic orientation, with the regional economy (q = 0.48) having the strongest influence and interacting with the factor of distance to commercial center to influence 61% of the spatial distribution; while the distance to commercial centers is the dominant factor for CR accessibility (q = 0.53), and its interaction with the regional economy was the strongest (q = 0.66). (3) The proliferation of O2O-FDR in Nanjing is more consistent with the innovation diffusion hypothesis. (4) In comparison to CR, O2O-FDR has a stronger correlation with fast food restaurants accessibility, which potentially increases the availability of less healthy food products.

The relationship between urban space and health has been widely proven and led to the emergence of new concepts, such as neurourbanism, an interdisciplinary field of research that aims to explain the relationship between mental health and the well-being of city life. The embryonic state of these interdisciplinary research fields requires further contributions to their consolidation and guidelines for practitioners and policymakers. The main aim of this article is to contribute to the discussion through reflections on public spaces and urban health. A critical analysis was conducted to respond to the following specific objectives: 1) to highlight the importance of public space for the promotion of quality of life; 2) to reinforce the awareness that the urban environment affects mental health and well-being; 3) to propose an organisation of health impact factors (determinants of urban health) that works as a tool for objective health assessment and monitoring in cities and; 4) to reinforce work on the importance of neurourbanism as an interdisciplinary science that unites neuroscience and urban planning.

As a developing spatial analysis method, OD flow clustering can be used to identify the dominant trends and spatial structures of urban mobility. However, urban flow exhibits universal heterogeneity, which is mainly manifested in irregular shapes, uneven distribution, and obvious scale differences. The existing methods are constrained by specific spatial scales and sensitive parameter settings, making it difficult to reveal heterogeneous urban mobility patterns within travel OD data. In this paper, we propose an OD flow analysis method that integrates spatial statistics and density clustering. This method can determine parameter values from datasets without manual intervention and adaptively identify multi-scale mixed OD flow clusters. In the simulation experiment, the proposed method accurately detects all preset OD clusters with less noise. It outperforms the baseline methods in terms of Silhouette Coefficient, V-measure, and Fowlkes Mallows index.

Our analysis unveils substantial spatial variations in how transit accessibility, amenities, residential density, and green/blue spaces influence real estate values. Proximity to metro stations and bike-sharing facilities exerts a more pronounced positive effect than bus stops. Moreover, residents in central areas demonstrate a higher willingness-to-pay for public service amenities, while those in outer suburbs prioritize access to public transportation infrastructure. Intriguingly, it invokes an optimal threshold range of urban density for properties in new cities, thereby increasing the vitality and dense socio-economic networks. Furthermore, the sprawling suburbs have identified an adverse economic impact of large conservation green/ blue spaces.

Assessing spatial-emotional interactions is crucial for human-centered urban planning and public mental health. However, prior research has focused on the spatial analysis of every single emotion, ignoring the intricate interactions between multi -emotions and space. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework to reveal the spatial co -occurrence patterns of multi-emotions using massive social media data in Wuhan, China. Specifically, the BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers) pre-trained model is utilized to classify each post into one of five basic emotions. Given the implementation of the K -means algorithm on these emotional results, the emotion-based similarities among different grids are investigated. The qualitative and quantitative results reveal six spatial co-occurrence patterns of conflicting or consistent emotions in urban space, namely, happiness-fear, happiness-anger, balanced emotion, happiness dominated, happiness-surprise, and happiness-sadness. In partic-ular, the balanced emotion pattern is the most prevalent and tends to be spatially concentrated in the city center, while patterns of happiness-anger and happiness-sadness are mainly observed in the suburbs. Plus, results of the Multinomial Logit Model (MNLM) indicate that the spatial multi -emotions co-occurrence patterns are significantly correlated with land use characteristics based on points-of-interest (POIs) data.

This research offers a comprehensive analysis of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon in Bangalore and Hyderabad, India, focusing on its spatial and temporal distribution and its correlation with air pollutants. Conducted over the course of summer and winter seasons from 2001 to 2021, this study advances our understanding of UHI dynamics in rapidly urbanizing regions, shedding light on the complex interplay between urbanization, climate, and air quality. The primary objective of this study is to assess and compare the predictive performance of baseline Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models for forecasting Land Surface Temperature (LST) in Hyderabad, India, while examining the impact of integrating spatial information into these models. Incorporating an extensive array of input variables, ranging from spectral indices to terrain features, land use/land cover (LULC) data, atmospheric parameters, and spatial data, the analysis reveals significant relationships between LST and various factors. Notably, Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) exhibit strong positive correlations with LST, while Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) demonstrates a pronounced negative correlation. Similarly, Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) displays the strongest positive correlation with LST (r = 0.49), whereas EVI exhibits the most notable negative correlation (r = -0.67). Additionally, Modified Bare Soil Index (MBI) demonstrates a noteworthy negative correlation (r = -0.48) with LST for Bangalore. Atmospheric components such as CO, NO2, and O-3 also show significant positive correlations with LST, with NO2 displaying the highest correlation during winter in urban areas. XGBoost emerges as the superior model, achieving high R-2 values of 0.84 for Bangalore and 0.88 for Hyderabad. Integration of spatial information consistently enhances the performance of both RF and XGBoost models, resulting in reduced Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values. However, predictions over water bodies tend to be underestimated. The study underscores the importance of incorporating spatial data for accurate LST prediction, with implications for environmental monitoring and management. Despite the advancements made, further research is needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms through which spatial information improves model performance, suggesting avenues for future investigation and refinement of modeling methodologies. At the intersection of rapid urban growth and environmental conservation, these findings are poised to inform policymakers, urban planners, and researchers, guiding them towards innovative and sustainable urban development strategies aimed at mitigating the adverse impacts of rapid urban expansion while promoting ecosystem well-being.

Using a combination of several measurement models such as the BCG (Boston Consulting Group) matrix, ESDA (Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis), MLR (Machine Learning Regression), GWR (Geographically Weighted Regression), and GeoDetector, this paper presents an empirical study on the changes in Urban Park Green Areas (UPGAs) in the Grand Canal of China. By quantitatively measuring the spatio-temporal evolution patterns of UPGAs, this study reveals the driving mechanisms behind them and proposes policy recommendations for planning and management based on performance evaluation. The spatio-temporal evolution of UPGAs and their performance in China's Grand Canal are characterized by significant spatial heterogeneity and correlation, with diversified development patterns such as HH (High-scale-High-growth), HL (High-scale-Low-growth), LH (Low-scale-High-growth), and LL (Low-scale-Low-growth) emerging. The evolution performance is dominated by positive oversupply and positive equilibrium, where undersupply coexists with oversupply. Therefore, this paper recommends the implementation of a zoning strategy in the future spatial planning of ecological green areas, urban parks, and green infrastructure. It is also recommended to design differentiated construction strategies and management policies for each zoning area, while promoting inter-city mutual cooperation in the joint preparation and implementation of integrated symbiosis planning. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal evolution of the UPGAs in the Grand Canal of China is influenced by many factors with very complex dynamic mechanisms, and there are significant differences in the nature, intensity, spatial effects, and interaction effects between different factors. Therefore, in the future management of ecological green areas, urban parks, and green infrastructure, it is necessary to interconnect policies to enhance their synergies in population, aging, industry and economy, and ecological civilization to maximize the policy performance.",urban park,evolution mode,driving mechanism,spatial planning,grand canal,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study constructed a compound spatial network of urban buildings-roads-emergency service facilities, and analyzed the complex dynamic impacts of time-varying dynamic floods on building risk, road risk, and emergency service accessibility. Firstly, a refined flood risk assessment at the building scale was carried out in combination with flood inundation, building vulnerability, population, vulnerable areas, underground buildings, and life facilities. Secondly, betweenness centrality indicator in complex networks was used to calculate road traffic capacity and collapse threshold, and the accessibility of emergency service facilities is calculated based on road traffic capacity. Finally, the interaction and feedback relationships between the compound spatial network were analyzed. The results show that: (1) Flooded building comprehensive risk analysis reveals that floods have a significant impact on residential and commercial land use, and high-risk flood areas are mainly concentrated in the central region of study area. (2) The road network has a collapse threshold, and the fluctuating state of emergency service accessibility is significantly influenced by road traffic capacity. (3) Roads act as ""bridges"" connecting buildings and emergency service facilities, leading to the redistribution of building flood comprehensive risk and emergency service accessibility, presenting complex dynamic changes over time. Additionally, submerged roads also affect the accessibility of emergency service facilities around flooded buildings, reducing the recovery capacity of flooded buildings, and exhibiting significant heterogeneity characteristics.

However, complex human-environment interactions make it difficult to accurately isolate urban effects in UHII evolutions due to unstable non-urban references. This study provided the first test on the sensitivity of surface UHII (SUHII) trend estimate to seven methods of non-urban reference delineation across 281 Chinese cities. The corresponding seven non-urban references include administrative non-urban areas, administrative non-urban areas excluding extreme elevations, administrative low plant areas, suburb, outer suburb, outer suburbs progressively excluding unstable areas interfered by evident greening/desertification trends and the SUHI footprint of neighboring cities, respectively. Results revealed that the selection of different non-urban references significantly altered SUHII and the nature of observed surface thermal island (heat or cold) in 74% and 8% of cities, respectively. Besides, due to diverse and inconsistent land use and land cover changes across and nearby non-urban areas, the way of nonurban reference delineation also affected the amplitude and even direction of statistically significant SUHII trends in 41% and 21% of cities, respectively. Among the seven methods, the use of suburb which was collectively interfered by urban and non-urban changing factors, produced a large number of misestimated significant downtrends (2.7-4.5 times more cities than other methods) and was therefore in general not recommended. Administrative non-urban areas were not suitable to cities with evident greening/desertification trends, yet the applicability can be largely enhanced by removing areas with extreme elevations. Low plant areas were in general feasible, except for the cities with suburban low plants additionally warmed up by urban areas. Outer suburb was relatively the optimal, particularly the areas with all concerned interferences excluded. Overall, this study provided empirical evidence supporting the need to use stable non-urban references for reliable trend estimate of urban-induced SUHII variations.

However, aiming to understand underlying mechanisms, it is necessary to consider that the individual is interacting with its environment. In this regard, this viewpoint discusses how urban health research benefits from integration of socioecological and interdisciplinary perspectives, combined with innovative ambulatory data assessments that enable researchers to integrate different data sources. It is stated that neither focusing on the objective and accurate assessment of the environment (from the perspective of spatial sciences) nor focusing on subjectively measured individual variables (from the public health as well as a psychosocial perspective) alone is suitable to further develop the field. Addressing person-place interactions requires an interdisciplinary view on the level of theory (eg, which variables should be focused on?), assessment methods (eg, combination of time-varying objective and subjective measures), as well as data analysis and interpretation. Firstly, this viewpoint gives an overview on previous findings addressing the relationship of environmental characteristics to physical activity and mental health outcomes. We emphasize the need for approaches that allow us to appropriately assess the real-time interaction between a person and a specific environment and examine within-subject associations. This requires the assessment of environmental features, the spatial-temporal behavior of the individual, and the subjective experiences of the situation together with other individual factors, such as momentary affective states. Therefore, we finally focused on triggered study designs as an innovative ambulatory data assessment approach that allows us to capture real-time data in predefined situations (eg, while walking through a specific urban area).",physical activity,urban health,ambulatory assessment,environment,mental health,real-time data,within-subject association,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Urban development and expansion have subjected PAs to significant pressure, as they are rapidly approaching. However, our understanding of the interaction between urban development and PAs in China when urbanization accelerated from 2000 to 2018 remains limited. To address this gap, we have realized the dynamic mapping of China's urban expansion and proposed the urban footprint intensity index (UFI) and PAs' UFI (PUFI) to quantify the spatial distribution of urban development and its potential pressure on PAs. Using the Generalized linear mixed-effects models, we also investigated how PAs limit the increase in UFI from multiple perspectives. Our results reveal that while China's urban areas continue to expand annually by 6101.3 km2, the distance between the protected area (PA) and the urban area is shrinking at a rate of 1.39 km per year, maintaining a logarithmic form. The PAs in the eastern China and the southern China always have higher PUFI values from 2000 to 2018. By contrast, those in the northern and western China have lower PUFI values in 2000, which increase dramatically by 2018. Across our study area, PAs have effectively acted as barriers to urban development, resisting a substantial 33.8% increase in UFI within their boundaries. Location and initial urban development conditions surrounding PAs are critical factors impacting their effectiveness in resisting urban development. These findings offer valuable insights for future assessments of the effectiveness of PAs in resisting urbanization on a global scale.

However, existing attempts at learning trajectory representations often encoded trajectory spatial-temporal relationships implicitly, which poses challenges in learning and representing spatiotemporal patterns accurately. Therefore, this paper proposes a joint spatialtemporal graph representation learning method (ST-GraphRL) to formalize structurally-explicit while learnable spatial-temporal dependencies into trajectory representations. The proposed ST-GraphRL consists of three compositions: (i) a weighted directed spatial-temporal graph to explicitly construct mobility interactions over space and time dimensions; (ii) a two-stage joint encoder (i.e., decoupling and fusion), to learn entangled spatialtemporal dependencies by independently decomposing and jointly aggregating features in space and time; (iii) a decoder guides ST-GraphRL to learn mobility regularities and randomness by simulating the spatial-temporal joint distributions of trajectories. Tested on three real-world human mobility datasets, the proposed STGraphRL outperformed all the baseline models in predicting movements' spatial-temporal distributions and preserving trajectory similarity with high spatial-temporal correlations. Furthermore, analyzing spatial-temporal features in latent space, it affirms that the ST-GraphRL can effectively capture underlying mobility patterns.

Clarence Stone's concept of urban regimes is used as a theoretical framework. Based on the author's system of criteria of social significance, 6 projects of urban environment transformation in 4 cities were selected and analyzed: Okhta Center and Tuchkov Buyan in St. Petersburg, Zaryadye Park and the development of fields of the Timiryazev Academy in Moscow, St. Catherine's Church in Yekaterinburg and concreting of the embankments of the river Vologda in Vologda. If the initial phase of all projects took place in the realities of local urban growth regimes, with the predominance of the interests of the established coalitions of business and government, then the subsequent increase in the role of public activism in all projects and the change of goal-setting under its influence led to a change in the local urban regime during their implementation. It is shown that in five studied cases, during the implementation of projects, there was a transition of local urban regimes from ""growth"" to ""progressive"", and in one - from ""growth"" to a greater extent towards the ""status quo"" regime.

Such conditions of mutual influence of socially significant projects and urban regimes can develop in a certain period in any major Russian city, then we can expect in it similar to the described results of space transformation.

However, the potential capacity of urban forest carbon sequestration (CS) and its drivers remain unclear in urban agglomerations under rapid urbanization. In our study, the net primary productivity (NPP) of built-up areas was reconstructed in the Harbin-Changchun urban agglomeration (HCUA) from 2000 to 2020 to reflect urban forest CS, and the drivers of spatial urban forest CS patterns were further explored using the Geodetector model. Our results showed that the HCUA has experienced rapid urbanization over the past 20 years. Across the urbanization gradient, the CS capacity was higher in new developing built-up areas than in the old developed built-up areas for all years. The CS capacity of urban forests increased gradually from 2000 to 2020, especially in large built-up areas. The urban forest CS was skewed toward low (<100 g & sdot;m (- 2)) and medium value (100-300 g & sdot;m (- 2)) class distributions in all years; however, the proportion of high CS (>300 g & sdot;m (- 2)) show an overall increasing trend from 2000 to 2020, especially in small, low-altitude and old developed built-up areas. The total CS of built-up areas increased from 0.35 Mt & sdot;C & sdot;yr (- 1) in 2000 to 2.06 Mt & sdot;C & sdot;yr (- 1) in 2020, and the urban forests in the HCUA could offset approximately 2.23 % of urban carbon emissions in 2000, increasing to 5.08 % in 2020. Natural factors, such as temperature, mainly determined changes of the spatial urban forest CS distribution. In addition, we found that urban morphology factors, such as urban build-up area, construction height, population density, and gross national product, can significantly influence urban forest CS. We further found there may exist the threshold of urban built-up area and gross national product significantly affecting urban forest CS variation. The interaction between natural and anthropogenic factors had stronger explanatory power for the spatial variation of CS.

While Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) remains the dominant method, alternative printing methods such as Spatial 3DP (S-3DP) have emerged. However, the majority of existing research on 3D printing technology has been emphasizing offline control, which lacks the capability to dynamically adjust the printing path in real time. Such an limitation has resulted in a decrease in printing efficiency. Therefore, this paper proposes a human-robot interaction (HRI) method based on real-time gesture control for Robotic Spatial 3DP (RS-3DP). This method incorporates utilization of YOLOv5 and Mediapipe algorithms to recognize gestures and convert the gesture information into real-time robot operations. Results show that this approach offers a feasible solution to address the issue of discontinuous S-3DP nodes because it achieves a gesture-controlled robot movement accuracy of 91 % and an average system response time of approximately 0.54 s.

The aim is to make this perspective sensitive to geographic differences and develop a ""spatial political economy of everyday life."" To operationalise this approach, I discuss the multi-scale analysis employed in a comparative project on austerity and urban youth in Ireland that sought to ground everyday consequences in a structural context.

This embedded comparative approach identified how the global financial crisis shaped national policies and how geographic differences shaped everyday spatial and personal consequences. This embedded comparative approach conceptualises cities as places where the structural and everyday constitute each other. It illuminates how this mutual interaction creates spatial particularities and common trends.

Exploring the interactions between cities can help decision-makers optimize regional resource allocation and improve regional spatial patterns. Combining the urban flow model and the patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model, this study simulates and analyzes the process of urban expansion in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, and investigates the impact of urban hierarchical structure differences on urban expansion. In this study, the role and influence of inter-city economy flow, transportation flow, population flow, and information flow on the development of urban agglomerations are comprehensively considered, and a multilevel urban interaction model is constructed based on a hierarchical generalized linear model (HGLM). Based on the national BTH cooperation and development strategy, a multi-scenario simulation study of urban expansion is carried out using the HGLM-PLUS model. The results indicate the following: (1) compared to the traditional PLUS model, the coupled HGLM-PLUS model, which considers multilevel urban flows, improved the overall accuracy by 0.047, the Kappa coefficient by 0.207, and the figure of merit (FoM) index by 0.051; (2) under different simulation scenarios, the development trend under the cooperation and development policy in the BTH region is more stable, demonstrating a relatively smooth urbanization expansion trend; and (3) under the BTH cooperation and development background, the total area of construction land in the BTH region is expected to be maintained at around 1,164,500 km2 by 2040.

This article focuses on innovative streets as a catalyst for sustainable urban transition. It reviews the theoretical discussions, and empirical evidence on innovative planning approaches for urban streets. For that purpose, measures related to innovative streets are divided into two broad categories: urban mobility and urban livability. The results indicate that integrating smart street facilities with the Internet of Things (IoT), adopting a combination of grid and radial street networks, and fostering a safe street environment are vital in promoting urban mobility. Conversely, a walkable, rideable, and human-oriented street environment enhances social interaction and urban livability. The street's dual function as a commuting and social space highlights the interplay between rising mobility and intensive street usage, leading to competition for street space. To mitigate these conflicts and advance sustainable urban transitions, enhancing street safety, reducing disparities in planning and user behavior, and accommodating the needs of all street users is crucial.

However, limited research has investigated the underlying driving forces and interactions of multidimensional urban form, specifically considering two-dimensional (2D) urban land use and three-dimensional (3D) buildings, on LST. Furthermore, their multi-scale outcomes remain unclear. Taking the main urban area of Wuhan City as an example, a total of nine indicators-the proportion of administration land (PA), the proportion of commercial land (PB), the proportion of industrial land (PM), the proportion of residential land (PR), the proportion of water area (PE), the building density (BD), the building height (BH), the floor area ratio (FAR), and the sky view factor (SVF)-were selected; this paper used the geographic detector model to investigate the driving force of LST spatial differentiation in winter and summer, as well as the interaction of various influencing factors from a multi-scale perspective. The results showed that (1) the average LST in industrial land was higher than that in commercial land, both in summer and winter. The LST in administration land was higher than that in residential land, while in winter, it is the opposite. (2) The spatial differentiation of summer LST was mainly dominated by 3D buildings, while the spatial differentiation of winter LST was mainly dominated by 2D land use. (3) BD was the leading driving force of LST spatial differentiation in summer, and the interaction between BD and any other indicator showed the most significant explanatory power, which is the same for PM in winter. (4) As scale increased, the explanatory power of 2D urban land use for LST spatial differentiation gradually increased both in winter and summer, while the explanatory power of PE on LST spatial differentiation decreased. The explanatory power of BD, FAR, and SVF on LST spatial differentiation remains basically unchanged. The explanatory power of BH on summer LST spatial differentiation decreases with increasing scale, while the explanatory power of BH on winter LST spatial differentiation remains in a stable state. (5) The interaction among all urban form factors primarily increases as the scale increases, except for the interaction between BH and 2D urban land use in summer, and the interaction between PE and PR in winter.

GIs are often planned and designed to reduce runoff and mitigate pollution. However, the influence of GI on groundwater hydrology and that of shallow groundwater on GI performance was seldom considered. This study utilized a calibrated surfacesubsurface hydrological model, i.e., Storm Water Management Model coupled with USGS 's modular hydrologic model (SWMM-MODFLOW) to consider the interaction between GI and groundwater into the process of GI planning. The optimal implementation ratio, aggregation level and upstream-downstream location of bioretention cells (BC, one type of GI) under different planning objectives and hydrogeologic conditions was explored. The consideration of groundwater management exerted a significant impact on the optimal spatial allocation of BCs. The results showed that when groundwater management was more concerned than runoff control, BCs were recommended to be allocated more apart from each other and more upstream in the catchment because more-distributed and upstream BCs can result in lower groundwater table rise which is beneficial. BCs were overall recommended to be allocated in areas of deeper groundwater tables, coarser soils, and flatter topographies. However, the spatial features of BCs are related to each other, the choice of them are affected by various hydrogeologic factors simultaneously. The exact location of BCs should be determined by considering the trade-off between runoff control efficiency and groundwater impact.

Utilizing spatial visualization techniques and the panel vector auto-regressive model, spatial differentiation patterns and interaction mechanisms among sub-dimensions are examined. Findings indicate an overall positive trajectory of UER, characterized by decreasing Pressure, noteworthy steady growth in State, and rising Response. Spatially, Pressure is higher in the north and lower in the south, with large cities becoming new centers of high pressure; State is higher in the southwest mountains and lower in the northeast plains; Responses center around Shanghai, expanding toward the southwest and northwest. The complex interactions between Pressure, State, and Response form a nested cycle of UER, indicating that the UER in the Yangtze River Delta is evolving towards a more rational development trend, where the tight mechanism of societal Response plays a key role. The implications underscore the urgent need for tailored regional governance strategies that leverage spatial variations, balance human impact on ecosystems, and optimize dimensional interactions for resilient city development.

In contrast, cost-based environmental regulations positively affect green development when spatial interactions are disregarded. However, they exhibit negative effects at the spatial level, potentially leading to a ""pollution relocation"" phenomenon.

The author defines environmental symbolic resources - urban signs or symbol carriers - the category of symbolic geopolitical capital (SGC), reveals their structure based on the applied example of St. Petersburg, as well as the principles of interaction with the urban environment and some ways in which SGK in symbolic politics are determined. The material carriers of symbols have at least four special properties that give the actors of urban symbolic politics an advantage when using these carriers in a competitive struggle: the duration of their existence and anchoring in the fabric of the city; the power of nomination - ideas about their legitimacy and public recognition; they are more likely to be encoded by the consciousness of the citizen in the form of a priori ""normal"", ""comfortable"" and positive perception; and they provide the actors of symbolic politics with special means of political maneuver, using the principle of separation and variability of interpretations of such signs. In addition to the principles of placement described for each category of signs, their generalized types are highlighted: spatial concentration, spatial confinement, spatial hierarchy and effective spatial representation. The means of symbolic management using SGC are described, such as: all kinds of physical actions with the carriers themselves; activism correlated with them; producing new political meanings of their nominations and renominations; reinterpretation of existing and production of new symbols and associated signs, thereby - the production of new symbolic resources and the reconfiguration of the symbolic space of the city. Examples are given of urban conflicts related to geopolitical urban signs reflected in public discourse. They are grouped by potential sources of conflictogenicity due to the different attitudes of actors to: practices and manifestations of territorial strategies, their results and consequences; concepts and proposed worldviews; ideas about control over territory. A number of principles and patterns for the formation and use of symbolic geopolitical capital associated with urban space in politics are formulated: specialization in the nomination, the ""latent"" nature of the potential for conflict inherent in the SGC, the change of hierarchies, stages or ""waves"" of geopolitical symbolic policy in urban space, the formation of a ""geopolitical symbolic footprint"".",symbolic capital,symbolic resources,urban space,critical geopolitics,urban conflicts,urban signs,monuments,toponymy,religious objects,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The industrial revolutions, each with their own innovations, have clearly modified the city and its spaces. The aim of this paper is to understand how the ongoing digital and robotic revolution is capable of changing the smart city of today and tomorrow. The introduction of new technologies, from autonomous robots to IoT, required a transdisciplinary approach. This implies the need to adapt traditionally adopted planning tools. Through the analysis of five testbed districts and the experiences of Digital Twin (DT) applications in urban environments, new spatial relationships are identified.These experiences, upstream of a Urban Digital Twin (UDT) application, highlight the potential that shared human-robot environments have for defining a digital infrastructure capable of monitoring, assessing and updating its boundary conditions in real-time based on continuous data sharing. Furthermore, they address the complexity of future urban planning by addressing participatory and collaborative processes so that human-robot coexistence is accepted and measured to the needs of citizens.The case study of this paper is the university campus of Savona, which unites different realities within it: companies, research centres, sports facilities, residences and laboratories.

The prevailing circulation pattern under these conditions is the Urban Heat Island Circulation (UHIC), which governs the characteristics of the urban pollution dome and the distribution of pollutants. This study aims to assess the UHIC's influence on spatial and temporal variations in pollutant concentrations and to investigate the efficiency of an Urban Chimney (UC) in improving air quality. Due to the interaction of micro- and meso-scale flows, a multi-scale analysis is required. For this purpose, a pressure-based CFD solver is adapted for analyzing airflow and pollutant dispersion in a multi-scale environment. A coordinate transformation method is used to account for meso-scale effects, and the resulting source terms are applied to the solver. The species transport equation is transformed to the new coordinate system, and the effects of species diffusion on enthalpy transport are included in the governing equations. The results demonstrate that UHIC reduces the average pollutant concentration and causes pollution peaks near ground level and at the city center. The interaction of micro-scale flow within the chimney with meso-scale UHIC impacts the flow field and pollutant concentration across the entire domain, decreasing the urban plume's vertical velocity by 40 percent and the mixing height at the city center by 20 percent. It also increases the vertical velocity within the UC by 23 percent. The UC can serve as a controlling tool for urban ventilation, and its capacity to remove pollutants increases sixfold when interacting with UHIC, reducing pollutant concentration citywide.",Urban heat island circulation,Air pollution dome,Urban chimney,Stable atmospheric condition,Urban ventilation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a manifestation of spatial arrangement in mature urban growth, the ecological challenges within urban agglomerations and their surroundings deserve attention. Therefore, clarifying the interrelation within the ESV and urbanization is crucial to constructing sustainable progress-oriented cities. Previous researches on the coordination relationship between ESV and urbanization have been limited to the provincial and county levels, and insufficient consideration has been given to the differences across urban and rural areas at different scales. Utilizing the coupling coordination degree (CCD) model, the present investigation assesses the interplay between urbanization and ESV across various scales within the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration (YRDUA) region from 2000 to 2020, and explores the differences in their distributions throughout the urban-rural gradient, aiming to help the regional coordinated development. The findings indicate that from 2000 to 2010, with increasing intensity of land use, the ESV in YRDUA area decreased. But between 2010 and 2020, ESV increased. Moreover, the CCD in the YRDUA has a positive relationship across ESV and urbanization, and is in a status of primary coordination from 2000 to 2020, with a slow upward trajectory. Meanwhile, along the rural-urban gradient, ESV and CCD both are declining, and there is a significant plunge from suburban to urban. And the interactions between ESV and urbanization have obvious spatial heterogeneity, which tends to show the coordination at broader scales, such as provincial and county levels, while manifesting conflicts at finer scales, such as the grid scale.

Our study investigates the complexity and spatial structuring of fish communities across urbanized watersheds and waterfronts in the Toronto region. We evaluated the influence of environmental factors, including habitat, human impact, and species traits, on fish community composition. Specifically, we identify distinct groups based on sampling locations using modularity analysis and partial least square path modeling (PLS-PM). Our results reveal three distinct fish community groups. The first group, primarily located in major watersheds such as Humber and Rouge, is characterized by lower human impact and larger tracts of less developed land, where habitat variables like water quality play a significant role. These areas support species with intermediate tolerance levels to disturbances. The second group includes diverse waterfront and nearshore habitats, where high species richness and variability are influenced by varied environmental conditions and riparian zones, with limited urban impact. The third group, encompassing some of the more urbanized areas, faces the constraints of urbanization and a high density of instream barriers, resulting in lower species diversity and a dominance of disturbance-tolerant species. Our findings highlight how different urban environments shape fish communities based on available habitat in interaction with species traits.

However, current research faces the following issues: (1) most VCA models neglect the spatial heterogeneity of driving factors within each land parcel when evaluating the environmental driving effects; (2) when calculating the neighborhood effects, simple statistics of land use types in neighboring parcels are often used, overlooking the influence of driving factors within neighboring parcels; (3) the ability to explore the interactions between land parcels is often limited. To address the aforementioned issues, this study proposes a HashGAT-VCA model for investigating urban land use changes. The model utilizes a Hash function to encode the non-uniform distribution of each driving factor within each irregularly shaped land parcel into a fixed-length vector, and constructs a graph structure between land parcels based on their spatial topological relationships. By employing a Graph Attention Network (GAT), the model explores the mechanisms of environmental driving effects and inter-parcel interactions to calculate the probability of land use change for each parcel. The proposed HashGAT-VCA model was applied to simulate urban land use changes in Shenzhen, China, from 2009 to 2012. Compared to other VCA models, the HashGAT-VCA demonstrated higher simulation accuracy. The results indicated that HashGAT-VCA can effectively capture the impacts of the heterogeneously distributed driving factors and the interactions between land parcels on land use changes. Additionally, this study simulated land use patterns for the years 2025 and 2030 under ecological control strategies, providing decision support for urban planning.",Vector Cellular Automata,Graph Attention Network,Hash function,Land use change simulation,Spatial interaction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Past studies, however, have primarily concentrated on regional and urban scales. The complexities of human-environment interactions necessitate a more fine-grained measure of urban morphology beyond two-dimensional spaces. This study delves into the intricacies of horizontal and vertical urban surfaces within community life circles. It examines humanscale landscapes using a bottom-up metric system that includes eye-level quality, road network design, buildings and functions, and neighborhood location. The methods of deep learning and street view images are utilized to evaluate the eye-level morphology. The study then analyzes the heterogeneous impacts and interaction effects of morphological variables on urban vitality at the community life circle level through multiscale geographic weighted regression and geographical detector model. The findings reveal a core-periphery structure and strong spatial autocorrelations between the morphological variables and urban vitality. Furthermore, the determinants of urban vitality exhibit a blend of global, regional, and local spatial contexts. The human-observed greenery, sky openness, and public bus accessibility demonstrate significant spatial heterogeneity linked to local vitality, whereas street betweenness and commercial facilities exhibit limited effects. The interaction effects between morphological variables can either enhance or weaken their individual impacts, highlighting the need for community life circle planning that considers the combined effects of these variables.

To help fill the current research void on the distribution patterns and driving mechanisms of urban plant diversity in the tropics, we tested the relationship between plant species richness and land use and anthropogenic and environmental factors in 491 urban functional units (UFUs) in three tropical cities in China (i. e., Zhanjiang, Haikou, and Sanya). The results showed highly significant differences in the distribution of plant richness between different land use types, with the high plant diversity found in residential areas, and leisure and entertainment areas. A positive relationship was found between construction age and spontaneous plant species richness. Furthermore, housing price, trimming and fertilizing frequencies were positively related with cultivated species richness and negatively related with spontaneous species richness. We conclude that urban plant species richness is not the result of a single factor but is influenced by the interaction between anthropogenic factors and environmental factors; although anthropogenic factors play the largest role in determining patterns of urban plant diversity.

To consider edge-based interactions and node attributes together, this study proposed a family of GeoAI-enhanced unsupervised community detection methods called region2vec based on Graph Attention Networks (GAT) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). The region2vec methods generate node neural embed- dings based on attribute similarity, geographic adjacency and spatial interactions, and then extract network communities based on node embeddings using agglomerative clustering.

The effects of centering varied: while employment centering negatively affected IM, population centering enhanced IM. Typical livable city indicators of walkability, mixed-use development, and a jobs-housing balance improved IM. Their effects on IM were magnified if either of the other two factors increased. However, the impact of walkability on IM decreased if employment centering increased and vice versa. Urban sprawl variables also indirectly influenced IM through inequality, segregation, social capital, and unemployment.

Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), the core region of the Yangtze River Delta (CYRD), and the Pearl River Delta (PRD) stand as three major economic centers characterized by the highest level of urbanization in China, encompassing areas of heightened ecological sensitivity. Nevertheless, the ecological quality at the scale of urban agglomerations remains ambiguous, with many studies failing to develop a comprehensive and effective method for comparing diverse urban agglomerations. Consequently, this study integrates multi-source remote sensing data, including information on land cover and other socio-economic parameters, to construct the Ecological Quality Index (EQI) based on the ""Function-Interaction-Pressure-Stability"" (FIPS) framework. Through a stratified determination of indicator weights grounded in both objective importance and empirical knowledge, we mapped the spatiotemporal changes of EQI and analyzed the impact of urbanization on ecological quality in three urban agglomerations from 2001 to 2020. We determined the following: (1) The calculated EQI can further capture the nuanced details with better performance at both underlining the discrepancy of highs and lows of EQI and describing the spatial detail of urban agglomerations' characteristics. (2) Substantial disparities in EQI and its changes are evident across different urban agglomerations.

The CYRD exhibits the largest affected area. (3) Urbanization predominantly influences ecological quality through land cover transitions. In expansion areas, ecological deterioration is significantly more pronounced, constituting approximately 90% of the total area. (4) Despite significant urbanization, city-level analysis in CYRD reveals a better coordination between urban expansion and ecological protection, with a lower intensity of ecological degradation compared to urban expansion rates. Conversely, some cities in the BTH, despite modest urban expansion, exhibit substantial declines in ecological quality, highlighting the need for targeted policy interventions.

In this study, based on PM2.5 concentration data from 2000 to 2020, PM2.5 pollution in 19 UAs in China was investigated. First, the annual average PM2.5 concentration was used to analyze the temporal variation, spatial distribution, and agglomeration characteristics of PM2.5 pollution in each UA. Then, factor detection was used to analyze the driving mechanisms of the effects of natural and human factors on PM2.5 pollution in UAs in China. Finally, the explanatory intensities of the interactions between different factors of PM2.5 pollution were analyzed based on interaction detection. The results show that from 2000 to 2020, the PM2.5 concentration exhibited an evolutionary trend of ""M""-shape. An inflection point occurred in 2007, and 2020 had the lowest value for the study period. PM2.5 of high concentration took the Central Plains and the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei UAs as the core of pollution. 2013 was an important turning point with a spatial pattern of expansion to the surrounding areas and then contraction to the center. UAs presented an elliptical spatial distribution, and outliers occurred in individual years.

The explanatory effect of the two-factor interaction was higher than that of a singular factor. Furthermore, the factor and interaction detection of natural factors found them to be more significant driving mechanisms than human factors.

The results of our study show that the impact of land-use transition on URI development exhibits regional and multi-scale characteristics. At the macro scale, rational growth of urban construction land will more effectively promote URI development in underdeveloped areas. At the meso and micro scales, cities (counties) with different URI development levels coexist, and for highly urbanized cities (counties), there is little benefit from promoting the expansion of construction land, and it is urgent to optimize land-use efficiency and land spatial morphology.

Understanding the supply-demand mismatches of ecosystem services (ES) and their drivers is essential for landscape planning and decision-making. However, integrating such information into spatial planning remains challenging due to the complex nature of urban ecosystems and their intrinsic interactions. In this study, we first assessed and mapped the supply, demand, and mismatches of six typical ES in Tianjin, China. We then clustered numerous townships based on their corresponding spatial characteristic of ES supply-demand mismatches. We also used Random Forest regression to examine the relative importance of drivers and applied Partial Least Squares structural equation modelling to decouple their interactions. The results showed that, the distribution of ES supply and demand showed obvious spatial heterogeneity, with a common surplus of ES supply in highly natural mountainous region and an excess of demand in urban centre. Additionally, all towns were classified into four spatial clusters with homogeneous states of supply-demand mismatches, serving as basic units for spatial optimization. Moreover, the interactions between drivers affected ES supply-demand mismatches in a coupled manner, including the direct effects of the socioeconomic factor (-0.821) and landscape composition (0.234), as well as the indirect effects of the biophysical factor (0.151) and landscape configuration (0.082).

Mapping social-ecological system (SES) archetypes has emerged as a promising tool in identifying these interactions in a spatially explicit manner and developing transferrable sustainability solutions based on context-specific challenges. However, state-of-the-art SES archetype mapping is mainly bound to administrative borders. Lack of spatial details in SES maps does not always capture the panorama of SES configurations and hidden mechanisms. Empowered by multiple open-access geospatial big data streams, this study mapped two-tier nested SES archetypes at 1 km fine resolution in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) urban agglomeration with high validation accuracy. Global SES archetypes derived from top-down rule-based classification revealed broad social-ecological configurations and social-ecological gradients across SESs. Meanwhile, regional SES sub-archetypes generated by bottom-up hierarchical clustering presented detailed SES characteristics that helped to identify location-specific sustainability challenges. Additionally, by scrutinizing the relationships among SES variables, we identified empirical evidence supporting the existence of four archetypical human-environmental interactions in an urban agglomeration area, manifesting as telecoupling between human and environment, human dependence on the environment, human adaption to the environment, and human modification and conservation of the environment. Generally, fine-resolution SES archetypes demonstrate great potential in supporting the recognition of local needs and gaps in existing policies, and further promoting sustainable landscape management in the BTH region and similar regions.",Social-ecological system,Archetype analysis,Human-environmental interactions,Geospatial big data,Urban agglomeration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The key is to better understand intraurban variability and urban-rural differences in atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) dynamics. This includes upwind-downwind effects due to cities' influences on the atmosphere beyond their boundaries. To address these aspects, a network of >25 ground-based remote sensing sites was designed for the Berlin region (Germany), considering city form, function, and typical weather conditions. This allows investigation of how different urban densities and human activities impact ABL dynamics. As part of the interdisciplinary European Research Council Grant urbisphere, the network was operated from autumn 2021 to autumn 2022. Here, we provide an overview of the scientific aims, campaign setup, and results from 2 days, highlighting multiscale urban impacts on the atmosphere in combination with high-resolution numerical modeling at 100-m grid spacing. During a spring day, the analyses show systematic upwind-city-downwind effects in ABL heights, largely driven by urban-rural differences in surface heat fluxes. During a heatwave day, ABL height is remarkably deep, yet spatial differences in ABL heights are less pronounced due to regionally dry soil conditions, resulting in similar observed surface heat fluxes. Our modeling results provide further insights into ABL characteristics not resolved by the observation network, highlighting synergies between both approaches. Our data and findings will support modeling to help deliver services to a wider community from citizens to those managing health, energy, transport, land use, and other city infrastructure and operations. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: A yearlong field campaign with a dense and systematic network of sites provides comprehensive measurements of the atmospheric boundary layer to gain deep knowledge of urban-rural and intraurban variability of surface-atmosphere exchanges. Understanding these is of high relevance for developing next-generation numerical weather prediction and climate models. We showcase the campaign and highlight synergies between ground-based and satellite observations and high-resolution numerical weather prediction modeling on two example days.

However, the literature on the decision-making processes of community-based pluvial flood risk management sheds little light on how local formal and informal actors relate to each other. This paper contributes to filling this research gap by exploring the interdependency between local authorities and community residents from a multilevel governance perspective. Two cases, based in Pearl River Delta Cities, are analysed to explore actors'interactions locally in the Chinese Sponge City Program, a national programme for urban pluvial flood risk management. The comparative study of the two cases leads to four conclusions. First, the Sponge City Program at the local level can be viewed as multilevel governance. Second, triggered by the goal set by the national government and the local contexts, local authorities see the benefit of locally integrating the Sponge City Program into an integrated and area-specific plan, emphasizing the importance of institutional assertiveness. Third, tensions and synergies exist in the interaction process between local authorities and residents that will have to be recognized and embraced and, where necessary, converted from constraining to enabling factors. Fourth, institutional barriers still dominate locally in the Sponge City Program because of a lack of support for cross-boundary cooperation and public participation. To span these boundaries, policymakers should be more open to changing the perspective from 'planning for people' to 'planning with people'.",Multilevel governance,Integrated planning,Shared governance,Self-regulation,Interdependency,Urban pluvial flood risk management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The endangered San Joaquin kit fox (Vulpes macrotis mutica; hereafter 'kit fox') is a small mesocarnivore inhabiting urban areas of the southern Central Valley of California alongside other urban mesocarnivores. These other species may pose challenges for kit foxes due to a potential lack of evolved mechanisms of defense or avoidance. To address this notion, we evaluated evidence of temporal and spatial partitioning between the kit fox and its potential predators and competitors in an urban environment. We predicted that spatial and temporal overlap would be lower between kit foxes and their predators than with their competitors. We used camera traps with scent lures at high school and college campuses across the southern San Joaquin Valley to monitor the visitation patterns of urban mesocarnivores from 2020 to 2022. We used generalized linear mixed models and AIC model selection to evaluate spatial relationships between kit foxes and other mesocarnivores and we used temporal overlap coefficients and peak activity analysis to evaluate temporal overlap. Kit foxes exhibited low spatial overlap (negative association) with Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana) and high spatial overlap (positive association) with domestic cats (Felis catus), domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), northern raccoons (Procyon lotor), and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis). Kit foxes exhibited low to moderate levels of temporal overlap with other species, the least of which occurring with potential predators (i.e., coyotes (C. latrans), domestic dogs).

Environmental regulation has proven to be an effective tool to directly combat PM2.5 pollution. However, whether it can moderate the impacts of urban expan-sion on PM2.5 pollution, in the context of rapid urbanization, is an interesting and unexplored topic. Therefore, this paper constructs a Drivers-Governance-Impacts framework and explores in depth the interactions among urban expan-sion, environmental regulation, and PM2.5 pollution. Based on 2005-2018 sample data from the Yangtze River Delta region, the estimation results of the Spatial Durbin model imply that (1) urban expansion has an inverse U-shaped as-sociation with PM2.5 pollution. The positive correlation may reverse when the ratio of urban built-up land area hits 0.21. (2) Of the three environmental regulations, investment in pollution control has little impact on PM2.5 pollution. Pollution charges and public attention exhibit a U-shaped and inverted U-shaped relationship with PM2.5 pollution, respectively. (3) In terms of moderating effects, pollution charges can exacerbate PM2.5 pollution from urban expansion, while public attention can inhibit it through its monitoring role. Therefore, we suggest that cities adopt dif-ferentiated strategies of urban expansion and environmental protection according to their urbanization levels.

Social interactions and spatial contexts are crucial structural factors that remain relatively underexplored. This study examines the intersections of social interactions and spatial contexts around injection drug use. More specifically, we investigate the experiences of different residential groups among young (aged 18-30) people who inject drugs (PWID) regarding their social interactions, travel behaviors, and locations connected to their risk behaviors. By doing so, we aim to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the multidimensional risk environment, thereby facilitating the development of informed policies.Methods: We collected and examined data regarding young PWID's egocentric injection network and geographic activity spaces (i.e., where they reside, inject drugs, purchase drugs, and meet sex partners). Participants were stratified based on the location of all place(s) of residence in the past year i.e., urban, suburban, and transient (both urban and suburban) to i) elucidate geospatial concentration of risk activities within multidimensional risk environments based on kernel density estimates; and ii) examine spatialized social networks for each residential group.Results: Participants were mostly non-Hispanic white (59%); 42% were urban residents, 28% suburban, and 30% transient. We identified a spatial area with concentrated risky activities for each residential group on the West side of Chicago in Illinois where a large outdoor drug market area is located. The urban group (80%) reported a smaller concentrated area (14 census tracts) compared to the transient (93%) and suburban (91%) with 30 and 51 tracts, respectively. Compared to other areas in Chicago, the identified area had significantly higher neighborhood disadvantages. Significant differences were observed in social network structures and travel behaviors: suburban participants had the most homogenous network in terms of age and residence, transient participants had the largest network (degree) and more non-redundant connections, while the urban group had the shortest travel distance for all types of risk activities.Conclusion: Distinct residential groups exhibit varying patterns of network interaction, travel behaviors, and geographical contexts related to their risk behaviors.

In this study, we focused on the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration (YRDUA) as our study area.

The findings of our study reveal that the development potential and optimal agglomeration pattern of urban subgroups in the YRDUA are closely linked to intercity cooperation, science and technology industries, foreign investment, and multiple interaction flows. Furthermore, our results suggest that local governments should focus on building a multi-core network flow pattern and fully utilizing the distinctive advantages of urban subgroups according to local conditions and time.

In this study, a multi-dimensional and multi-process index system based on the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) framework was developed to measure the level of urban waterlogging resilience (UWR). The spatial distribution of UWR on a block scale was explored based on the entropy weight method with the natural breakpoint method (EWM-NBM) in the central district of Wuhan City, China. In addition, the effects of the runoff control facilities and early warning measures on UWR were also quantified. Further, the Geodetector was used to investigate the main driving factors of UWR and their interactions. Results showed that the constructed index system for UWR based on the PSR framework performed reasonably, and the EWM-NBM was validated to be effective in the integrated assessment. In terms of the validation results, 82.72 % of the recorded waterlogging points belonged to high and very-high risk levels. The spatial heterogeneity of UWR was significant in the study area where the higher-level UWR mainly appears in the areas near the undeveloped suburban and water bodies (lakes and rivers), and the lower-level UWR was concentrated in central urban areas with more impervious surfaces. There was a clear increasing trend in UWR after the implementation of runoff control facilities and early warning measures, but its spatial distribution remained almost invariant.

Understating how ESs respond to land use/land cover (LULC) patterns is critical for identifying and controlling ecological risks. However, little is known about the ES patterns, interactions, and drivers at different urban hierarchical scales, posing great challenges for multiscale landscape planning. This study evaluated changes in multiple ESs and identified ecological risks using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs model in the Nanjing metropolitan area at the main urban, city, and metropolitan scales during 2000-2020. Then, ES interactions and drivers at different urban hierarchical scales were explored using Spearman's correlation analysis and the GeoDetector. By integrating the ES information above, a new multiscale landscape planning framework was proposed to mitigate ecological risks at different urban hierarchical scales. The results showed that most ESs have declined due to rapid urbanization. The ecological risks decreased with increasing spatial scale. The ES trade-offs/synergies at the small spatial scale may change at a larger spatial scale. Landscape composition was the dominant driver of ESs at the main urban scale, and the influence of natural factors strengthened with an increasing spatial scale. The construction of blue-green infrastructure is an effective way to mitigate ecological risk, but the effect is scale-dependent. Different urban hierarchical scales may face different ecological risks, and targeted landscape planning should be designed for different urban scales. The multi-scale landscape planning framework proposed in this study helps to identify the most effective landscape planning measures at different urban hierarchical scales. More attention should be paid to landscape configuration at small scales and ecological restoration at large scales. This study provides a technical framework to guide sustainable landscape planning and build resilient cities.",Spatial scale,Urban planning,Urbanization,Ecosystem services,Interactions,Drivers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Taking Guangming Town in the urban fringe area of Shenzhen as an example, this paper reveals the process and dynamics of spatial consumerization transformation under the influence of capital intervention. It examines the intricate mechanisms of capital operation underlie the production of space, and endeavors to explore a novel model of rural spatial regeneration in China's urban fringe areas. This paper found that the production of space in Guangming Town under the capital intervention includes the material production and social relations production. With the reconstruction of spatial form and relationships, new local products, spatial configuration, social services and organizational relations are generated, forming a consumption space with heterogeneous landscape, market institutionalized management, commercialization and symbolization. The realization of the production of consumption space in urban fringe areas is based on the joint action of core elements such as land, capital and government, which provide the material foundation, operational power and coordination organization for space consumption. These promote capital to complete the triple cycle of ""acquiring land - creating space scarcity - realizing space consumption"", and then realizing space reproduction and capital appreciation. In the Chinese context, the spatial transformation and production of urban fringe areas should not be regarded as a local practice of Western counter-urbanization or rural gentrification theory. Rather, it as a new spatial regeneration mode that harmonizes urban and rural production, lifestyles and development trajectories.

Interactions between rainfall data and urban catchment characteristics highlight the urgent need of accurate and effective precipitation data to apply in reliable hydrological simulations. However, it remains a challenge to obtain accurate rainfall datasets on such small scales in urban areas. As satellite remote sensing is the only method that can achieve global observation, it is important to evaluate satellite precipitation products in their ability to accurately capture intense precipitation on urban flood scales. This study evaluates the performance of the latest version 06B (V06B) Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) in North China Plain, with using the Radar-Gauge merged precipitation estimates as reference data. First, it could be concluded that IMERG fails to accurately estimate precipitation in the whole study area, having the problem of overestimating light precipitation and underestimating heavy precipitation. Second, results show that IMERG has poor ability to capture heavy precipitation on small scales, with the percentage of Hit nearly 0 and the percentage of Miss higher than 40 % for all the precipitation cases. Third, with the expansion of heavy precipitation centers' coverage, the problem of IMERG not to detect heavy precipitation gets mitigated, with the percentage of Miss decreasing by 14 % (19 %). However, the ability to capture both spatial location and precipitation intensity is still not good, the percentage of Hit ranging from 0.05 % to 7 %, without obvious improvement. When IMERG is able to capture the center of strong precipitation, it also tends to overestimate the weak precipitation around the center of strong precipitation. Results of this study provide an improved understanding of how well the V06B IMERG products capture the heavy precipitation center at small scales in urban areas, which will be useful for both developers and users of IMERG.",Urban areas,Small spatial scales,Hourly precipitation,Heavy precipitation centers,Heavy precipitation centers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The WUI is widespread and expanding, with detrimental consequences to human lives, property, and neighboring ecosystems. While the WUI has been mapped in many regions, Europe does not have a high resolution WUI map to date. Moreover, while most WUI research has been focused on quantifying spatial and temporal patterns, little is known about the relationship between the WUI and the socioeconomic conditions that drive its formation. Here, we present the first high-resolution map of the European WUI and provide the first macro-scale analysis of the relationship between the WUI and some of its potential drivers. We found that the WUI covers about 7.4 % of Europe, but its extent varies considerably both across and within countries, with sub-national WUI cover varying from nearly zero to almost 90 %. WUI cover is significantly related to socioeconomic variables such as GDP per capita, the proportion of the population above 65 years old, population density, road density, and the proportion of protected areas, but these effects are complex and interactive. This suggests that WUI drivers are likely to differ across and within countries, and hints about the importance of both top-down and local socioeconomic processes in driving the WUI.

In particular, much discussion has concentrated on the measurement of distance decay on the regional scale, since the emphasis of the model utilisation has been on explaining inter-regional mobility (mainly commuting). The intra-urban context makes the estimation more complicated and the fundamental questions, such as how far people travel within the city to reach a variety of urban destinations, and whether there are potentially significant differences between these types of destinations, are still not answered in a satisfactory way. In response to this challenge, the paper attempts to reveal the spatial variations of the distance decay effect on movements in urban space through the utilisation of mobile phone data. The signalling data from all major mobile network operators in Slovakia represent new opportunities with high accuracy of measurement and complexity of representation. The methodological procedure for deriving data about human daily move-ments from the mobile network at the level of 1 x 1 km statistical grid cells is presented. The objective is to estimate the appropriate distance decay functions for urban grids and demonstrate the variation of decay curves within the Bratislava city. The findings relativise the decay law of human mobility. For the approximation of daily mobility within the urban area, the polynomial-exponential function - the decreasing function with a small increase of interaction intensity at a greater distance - describes the impedance of travel distance more pref-erably. However, a significant proportion of urban grids have recorded weak or even no decay. A question worth investigating is whether the resulting friction of distance is a result of a specific functional structure of the study area, or it could reflect an advanced stage of urban evolution.",Distance decay variation,Mobile phone data,Daily mobility,Urban grid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An ecosystem service (ES)-based approach to landscape interventions maximises the provision of ESs, and in doing so, repairs and reinforces threatened ecological planetary boundaries. As an urbanising planet, cities are critical frontiers of human interaction with these planetary boundaries, and therefore a critical arena for ES-based intervention. Globally, the predominant pattern of urbanisation is dedensification, an outwardly expanding trend where cities are growing in physical extent at a higher rate than their population growth. We therefore require spatially explicit tools capable of reconciling dedensification and Good Anthropocene visions. We propose a methodology that integrates agroecology and urbanisation and is focussed specifically on the supply of targeted regulating ESs. This 'Agroecology for the City' differs from conventional urban agriculture discourse and its preoccupation with food security. Our research interest is agroecological farm systems' (AFSs) capacity to provide critical life support services in a spatially effective manner to urban systems. Our recent research introduced a new GIS-based model (ESMAX) and a spatial agroecology approach that identified AFS configurations at a 1 ha scale which maximised the supply of three regulating ESs, as well as multifunctional performance across all three ESs combined. In the present research, we apply this process at a larger scale, with 1 ha and 4 ha AFS parcels being integrated with a real-world 200 ha peri-urban residential development. The AFS parcels and built-up areas are configured differently to maximise the supply of ESs identified as critical by the local community. We found that arrangements with AFS parcels interspersed evenly with built-up areas provided the best multifunctionality across the four ESs tested. This supports pathways for a Good Anthropocene that work with the global urbanising reality of dedensification and underpin the need for a hybrid science of rural/urban systems.",dedensification,ecosystem services,GIS,urban agroecology,adaptive management,spatial design,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Urban master planning has theoretically been the fundamental strategy with regard to the distribution of spatial resources in urban areas. However, in reality, the regulation of urban planning has not achieved the legally binding goals pertaining to resource savings, environment friendliness, and preservation of natural and cultural resources. There have been public power interferences in the implementation of urban planning, which has often led to serious environmental pollution, destruction of heritage, and safety issues. This article uses ""Urban planning failure"" to describe this phenomenon. Currently, practitioners disagree on what causes urban planning failure exactly. The Q methodology has been applied to facilitate the analysis of urban planning failure in the Chinese context. The research findings show that the ""top-down"" (senior official's absolute authority) and ""network"" (stakeholder's multiple interaction) interpretation of urban planning failure have been verified, while the ""bottom-up"" interpretation has not been substantiated. In the institutional context of decentralization of decision making power in urban planning from the central to local governments, senior official's absolute authority of local governments is the logical starting point to interpret the urban planning failure. The pressure of political performance and the absolute obedience of subordinates molded the structural conditions of urban planning failure.

In this paper, based on the improved nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA)-II algorithm, the cumulative ranking adaptation assignment strategy is proposed and introduced along with the arithmetic crossoperator, which significantly improves the convergence speed of the algorithm. Secondly, the theory of complex adaptive systems (CASs) combines computer and urban governance to enhance the selfregulation ability of smart cities to a certain extent and better adapt to external environmental changes. Finally, the kernel density and network analysis of commercial outlets are carried out to determine the distribution pattern and characteristics of each type of business in each region. For the urban construction of Pingdingshan City, regression analysis is used to point out the different situations with other cities from the perspective of quantitative analysis. The results show that the commercial point density is positively correlated with the global integration degree and negatively correlated with the total depth value.

Urban development in areas that are geologically prone to subsidence may have long-term impacts, both on settlements and infrastructure. Therefore, it is necessary to acknowledge its ground deformation trait and how it interacts with urban spatial development.

The Fenwei Plain is one of the most severely polluted areas in China. We collected daily average PM2.5 concentration data of 11 cities in the Fenwei Plain, China in 2019. We then developed an interpretive structural model to statistically analyze the spatial correlation and hierarchical transmission of haze pollution between the 11 cities. The results showed that haze pollution has a strong systematic correlation between the 11 cities, and a regional haze pollution community has formed throughout the region.

Urban planning has emerged as a crucial strategy for mitigating PM2.5 pollution. What remains unclear is the impact of urban form and their interactions with seasonal changes. In this study, base on the air quality monitoring stations in the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration, the relationship between urban spatial indicators (building morphology and land use) and PM2.5 concentrations was investigated using full subset regression and variance partitioning analysis, and seasonal differences were further analysed. Our findings reveal that PM2.5 pollution exhibits different sensitivities to spatial scales, with higher sensitivity to the local microclimate formed by the three-dimensional structure of buildings at the local scale, while land use exerts greater influence at larger scales. Specifically, land use indicators contributed sustantially more to the PM2.5 prediction model as buffer zone expand (from an average of 2.41% at 100 m range to 47.30% at 5000 m range), whereas building morphology indicators display an inverse trend (from an average of 13.84% at 100 m range to 1.88% at 5000 m range). These results enderscore the importance of considering building morphology in local-scale urban planning, where the increasing building height can significantly enhance the disperion of PM2.5 pollution. Conversely, large-scale urban planning should prioritize the mixed use of green spaces and construction lands to mitigate PM2.5 pollution. Moreover, the significant seasonal differences in the ralationship between urban spatical indicatiors and PM2.5 pollution were observed. Particularly moteworthy is the heightened association between forest, water indicators and PM2.5 concentrations in summer, indicating the urban forests may facilitate the formation of volatile compunds, exacerbating the PM2.5 pollution. Our study provides a theoretical basis for addressing scalerelated challenges in urban spatial planning, thereby forstering the sustainable development of cities.",PM 2.5 concentrations,Building morphology,Land use,Scale,Urban planning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Soja's model, comprising first, second, and third spaces, emphasizes the pervasive influence of spatiality and its role in generating injustices. His spatial justice theory highlights the importance of understanding how the trialectical operation of space influences injustices. However, further study is needed to determine how practical tri-spatial interactions cause spatial injustices, despite prior research addressing these concepts. This study delves into the impact of the interplay between the three spaces on the realization of rights and the emergence of barriers hindering individuals from benefiting from state initiatives that are designed to provide for them. Using Chile as a case study, specifically for three communes and three state programs, this study employs structural qualitative sampling, engaging with users and public managers. Through semi-structured interviews and emotion maps with 51 participants, this study sheds light on the spatial, trialectical, and dynamic dimensions influencing the enjoyment of rights and the creation of spatial barriers to their realization. The findings revealed three spatial configurations, exclusion, abstention, and desertion, stemming from the triadic operation of spatial barriers in the first, second, and third spaces. These configurations prevent individuals from realizing their rights, emphasizing the critical role of tri-spatiality in shaping effective rights realization.

This study investigates the institutional factors driving urban sprawl in China through a case study of Wuhan, exploring the impact of influential governmental bodies on the spatiotemporal characteristics of urban sprawl as reflected in stringent policy implementations and top -down planning institutions. By employing spatial measurements, statistical analysis, and policy interpretation based on extensive fieldwork data, we observed a marked intensification of leapfrogging urban land expansion accompanied by the encroachment of agricultural land between 1996 and 2014 in Wuhan. These transformations are predominantly attributable to a two-tiered institutional mechanism comprised of central -local and intra-city institutional changes. Temporal shifts in spatial expansion have been heavily influenced by the interplay between central transitional development policies and corresponding local planning responses. The choice of specific locations for land sprawl is governed by the interaction of different government levels, each focusing on local development strategies and land institutional arrangements.

Critiques of master planning in Africa label it as a stifling product of colonial legacies, an inappropriate imposition of external ideas, or a device to achieve the goals of global actors, all seen as being at odds with the rapidly changing settlement patterns and needs of many African urban contexts. This paper instead focuses on the role of local planning actors in the demand for and the production of master plans and proposes a different analytical perspective on the role of master planning in African urban contexts. Notably, we point to the weak presence of master planning in colonial contexts, in contrast with the strong activation of master plans to shape the ambitions of newly independent governments. We observe also the nuanced interactions between local actors and transnational circuits and influences in devising and implementing plans. The paper presents three case studies which demonstrate the persistence of master planning practices through the post-independence period and their proliferation in contemporary moments. We document the diverse range of local actors who have chosen to retain or revise colonial planning legacies, initiate new city-wide master planning, or solicit, shape and assume responsibility for master planning promoted by transnational circuits of development and planning. We find that actors embedded in local or national institutions, and a wide variety of transnational actors, are driven by a range of, at times conflicting, interests and ideas about what planning is and is meant to do. Historical surveys and in-depth interviews with current actors, as well as those from the recent past in Accra (Ghana), Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) and Lilongwe (Malawi), help us to identify three aspects of urban master planning which challenge existing interpretations. We observe that master planning has been a persistent presence, although often taking a more ephemeral form in extended ""silent"" periods when outdated but valued plans remained operative. We note that complex political tensions and institutional landscapes shape enthusiasm for, and control over the nature, preparation, adoption and implementation of master plans, including their being side-lined or resisted - localnational dynamics are crucial here. This leads to a pragmatic engagement with transnational actors to bring forward different kinds of plans. The prolific production of master plans supported by multiple transnational actors in poorly resourced contexts constitutes a dynamic, although at times counterproductive, terrain of visioning and practical planning initiatives seeking to grapple with the pace and unpredictability of urbanisation.

Meanwhile, the conflicts and complex interaction characteristics of the EGI and CUI are discussed from both static and dynamic perspectives, and their driving mechanisms are investigated by combining specific indicators. The results demonstrate that over the past 20 years, LULC in Nanjing was dominated by cultivated land, forest land, and artificial surfaces. The encroachment of artificial surfaces on green space was strengthened, resulting in a decrease in the proportion of cultivated land from 70.09% in 2000 to 58.00% in 2020. The CUI increased at a change rate of 0.6%/year, while the EGI showed significant browning (change rate: -0.23%/year), mainly concentrated within the main urban boundaries.

As a result, urban areas are expected to undergo further anthropogenic transformations, which will not only influence spatial development (i.e. sealing urban systems) but also affect local climatic conditions. One likely consequence is the increasing incidence of adverse interactions between two phenomena occurring in city centers, which can have a significant impact on human quality of life: urban heat islands (UHI) and urban pollution islands (UPI). Here, we review scientific research relating to the interaction of UHI and UPI. Two basic databases were used: Web of Science and Scopus. The literature review covers publications appearing between 1968 and 2022 (Web of Science: 1300 related to 'heat island', 18,222 on 'air pollution'; Scopus: 4393 on 'heat island' and 34,498 on 'air pollution'), in fields such as environmental studies and meteorology studies.

However, the ecological barriers and hinterland spaces of the city center provide important ecological functions. In this study, we selected forest birds as indicator species of the urban ecological environment and explored the spatial stratification and heterogeneity effects of environmental substrates and anthropogenic activities on bird diversity (species richness, abundance, Shannon-Wiener index, and Simpson index) in urban-rural interlaced zones using the optimal parameter geographic detector model to characterize the changes in ecological functions in these zones. The results of this study are as follows: (1) The bird diversity index in Minhang District, Shanghai, showed an obvious urban-rural gradient divergence with the transition of urban zone- rural-urban interface - rural zone. An agglomerative spatial differentiation pattern was observed more in the southeast but less in the northwest, with a high degree of spatial distribution concentrations and evident imbalance characteristics. (2) The spatially stratified heterogeneity in bird diversity in urban-rural interlaced zones was because of the combined action of multiple driving factors under the three dimensions of habitat environment, degree of urbanization, and anthropogenic interference. Most of the interactions between any two factors showed non-linear or bifactorial enhancement effects. Furthermore, the one-factor explanatory power of urbanization and anthropogenic interference factors on bird diversity was significantly higher than that of the habitat environment factor.

However, little is known of the impact on communities of interactions between multiple environmental factors, and frequent changes in the flow of mountain rivers are different from those in the flow of plain river networks, which also impact differently the benthic community. Thus, there is a need for research on the response of benthic communities to environmental changes in mountain rivers under flow regulation. In this study, we collected samples from the Jiangshan River in the dry season (November 2021) and the wet season (July 2022) to investigate the aquatic ecology and benthic macroinvertebrate communities in the watershed. Multi-dimension analyses were used to analyze the spatial variation in the community structure and response of benthic macroinvertebrates to multiple environmental factors. In addition, the explanatory power of the interaction between multiple factors on the spatial variation of communities, and the distribution characteristics of benthic community and their causes were investigated. The results showed that herbivores are the most abundant forms in the benthic community of mountain rivers. The structure of benthic community in Jiangshan River was significantly affected by water quality and substrate, whereas the overall community structure was affected by river flow conditions. Furthermore, nitrite nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen were the key environmental factors impacting the spatial heterogeneity of communities during the dry and wet season, respectively. Meanwhile, the interaction between these environmental factors showed a synergistic effect, enhancing the influence of these environmental factors on community structure.

An Empirical Study to Identify Influential Components of Human Territoriality on Social Interaction,SUSTAINABILITY,JUL 2023,1,"Although urbanisation and urban land limitations are prevalent, residential complexes are seldom discussed as a means of compartmentalising social interactions and contributing to residents' social interactions. Due to the spatial orientation of social interactions, semi-public spaces in these buildings are unable to host residents' interactions due to a lack of appropriate arrangements/establishment of tangible and visible objects. The influential components, however, have rarely been identified in residential complexes. To fill this gap, using the theory of human territoriality, the current study explores the influential physical components of human territorialities in semi-public spaces in four residential complexes and investigates whether a significant relationship exists between human territorialities' physical components and social interactions. This study collected data from 264 residents of four residential complexes with different spatial configuration layouts. Pearson correlation and Spearman's rank correlation are used to evaluate linear and monotonic relationships between study variables. The correlation between spatial configurations of physical components and residents' interactions confirms that spatial configurations influence residents' use of semi-public spaces. Social interaction can, therefore, be improved through green space, brightness, accessibility, and furniture in common areas. The findings prove that residential complexes with clustered arrangements have not performed well in creating social interaction due to the lack of defined spaces and territories for people, but multi-core, mixed, and linear complexes that define several open and semi-open spaces have been more successful in the amount of social interaction of residents.

The Whitson River watershed is a mixed land-use Precambrian shield watershed located in Northeastern Ontario, Canada in which groundwater is a source of municipal water supply and in which groundwater and surface waters are at risk of potential impacts from urban runoff, ongoing municipal drainage projects, periodic flooding, and climate change. This study used watershed-scale synoptic surveys of stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta H-2) and geochemistry, and corresponding mixing-model approaches (two-component and three-component) to quantify the seasonal and spatial variation in surface water, ambient, and urban groundwater contributions to streamflow. Multiple mixing models were generated based on isotope and geochemical source water identification, and the performance of these models was compared. Mixing-model analyses showed that groundwater contributes a critical, sustaining source to streamflow (> 50 % or more) during summer baseflow conditions, dropping to similar to 15 % in fall when connection to shield lakes and wetlands dominate. Three-component mixing models showed similar results to the two-component models, refining groundwater contributions into ambient and urban groundwater sources. Estimated urban groundwater contributed 30 % or more to summer baseflow, dropping to similar to 4 % in the fall. Baseflow estimates derived from graphical hydrograph separation were similar to mixing model groundwater estimates in the summer but suggest this approach overestimates groundwater contributions during the fall. These results demonstrate the complexity of source water contributions to streamflow and the challenges in their determination in mixed-land-use Precambrian Shield landscapes where communities are largely located. Assessment of source water contributions to streamflow across the Whitson River sub-watershed has generated a region-specific conceptualization (e.g. urban versus ambient groundwater) of a basin that is experiencing increased urban development, providing information that will be of value for long term management.",Groundwater-surface water interactions,Hydrograph separation,Tracer-based mixing model,Isotope hydrology,Tracer,Chloride,Mixed land-use,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Employing this framework in the Great Bay Area (GBA), by considering the composition of the UFV database, we leveraged Machine Learnings and the Urban Vitality Index for quantifying the UFS and VE, respectively. SHapley Additive exPlanations was employed to quantify the local contributions of various factors to UFV. We found (1) a discernible upward trajectory in UFV across the GBA from 2012 to 2020, coupled with an expansion in spatial scope, indicative of persistent challenges in the future, and (2) the impervious surface percentage emerges as the primary contributor to UFV, exhibiting spatial heterogeneity reflective of regional environments.

Understanding the connection between public attitude and urban mobility during the recovery phase is crucial for the planning of resilience urban environment. This study investigates the changes in urban mobility and public attitudes by analyzing public transportation and social media data. Findings indicate a significant increase in mobility during the recovery compared to the semi-lockdown period, with better resilience to subsequent outbreaks. Commercial areas and major public transit interchanges exhibited stronger recovery in mobility after new (sub)variants waves. Train mobility demonstrated robust recovery. Relaxation in April 2022 played a crucial role in increased mobility and reduced negative feelings. This policy shift contributed to a surge in positive emotions, particularly in locations where individuals could engage in social and recreational activities. Moreover, the increased beyond- neighborhood mobility was related to decreased negative emotions during the easing of restrictions.

Although the cooling effect of urban parks has been widely recognized, the understanding of park cooling intensity (PCI) and its mechanisms remains incomplete. Applicable and accurate quantification could facilitate better design and management of urban parks. We used five methods (equal area method [EAM], equal radius method [ERM], fixed radius method [FRM], turning point method-maximum perspective [TPM-M], and turning point method-accumulation perspective [TPM-A]) to estimate PCI, and established the method selection mechanism, which we evaluated in terms of PCI amplitudes, spatial heterogeneity, and interactions with park landscape features. Using Nanjing as a case study, we employed spatial and statistical analyses to further assess the autocorrelation of PCI and its relationship with park landscape features. The results indicate the following: (1) 62.38 % of Nanjing's urban parks are located above the 90 % confidence level in cold spot areas. (2) Different methods had significant effects on the estimated PCI, were positively correlated, and had similar spatial heterogeneity. (3) All methods revealed that park area (PA), water area proportion (WAP), and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of the vegetated area (NDVIveg) were the three dominant factors that influenced PCI; WAP and NDVIveg that achieved more effective cooling. (4) The quantification of PCI using the ERM and TPM is recommended over other methods.

To bridge this gap, our study leverages land use data and Points of Interest (POIs) to categorize residential land into distinct types, and further explore the influence of mixed-use residential land and housing types on the spatial distribution of burglary rates. Key findings reveal that: 1) Residential land can be segmented into three distinct categories: pure residential, residential-office, and residential-commercial. 2) While a significant relationship is not observed between residential-office land and burglary, both pure residential and residential-commercial land exhibit a notable increase in burglary occurrences, with the latter exerting the most significant impact. 3) Notably, the commercial environment significantly heightens the attractiveness of high-end commercial housing for burglary, whereas for affordable housing, the commercial environment enhances its deterrent effect against burglary. This dichotomy is attributed to the spatial service scope and target clientele of commercial facilities. The findings furnish a scientific rationale for burglary prevention and control strategies across diverse community types, ultimately contributing to a safer urban environment.

Recent advancements in Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection, which involve detecting and localizing the interactions between human and object pairs, have undeniably marked significant progress. However, the realm of human-object-object interaction, an essential aspect of real-world industrial applications, remains largely uncharted. In this paper, we introduce a novel task referred to as Human-Object-Object Interaction (HOOI) detection and present a cutting-edge method named the Human-Object-Object Interaction Network (H2O-Net). The proposed H2O-Net is comprised of two principal modules: sequential motion feature extraction and HOOI modeling. The former module delves into the gradually evolving visual characteristics of entities throughout the HOOI process, harnessing spatial-temporal features across multiple fine-grained partitions. Conversely, the latter module aspires to encapsulate HOOI actions through intricate interactions between entities. It commences by capturing and amalgamating two sub-interaction features to extract comprehensive HOOI features, subsequently refining them using the interaction cues embedded within the long-term global context. Furthermore, we contribute to the research community by constructing a new video dataset, dubbed the HOOI dataset. The actions encompassed within this dataset pertain to pivotal operational behaviors in industrial manufacturing, imbuing it with substantial application potential and serving as a valuable addition to the existing repertoire of interaction action detection datasets. Experimental evaluations conducted on the proposed HOOI and widely-used AVA datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques by margins of 6.16 mAP and 1.9 mAP, respectively, thus substantiating its effectiveness.",Human-Object-Object Interaction,Action Detection,Interaction Model,Temporal Context,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These changes in mobility patterns were not uniform, as numerous factors, including public health measures, socioeconomic status, and urban infrastructure, influenced them. This study examines human mobility changes during COVID-19 in San Diego County and New York City, employing Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) and various network measures to analyze connectivity and socioeconomic status (SES) within these regions. While many COVID-19 and mobility studies have revealed overall reductions in mobility or changes in mobility patterns, they often fail to specify 'where' these changes occur and lack a detailed understanding of the relationship between SES and mobility changes. This creates a significant research gap in understanding the spatial and socioeconomic dimensions of mobility changes during the pandemic. This study aims to address this gap by providing a comprehensive analysis of how mobility patterns varied across different socioeconomic groups during the pandemic. By comparing mobility patterns before and during the pandemic, we aim to shed light on how this unprecedented event impacted different communities. Our research contributes to the literature by employing network science to examine COVID-19's impact on human mobility, integrating SES variables into the analysis of mobility networks. This approach provides a detailed understanding of how social and economic factors influence movement patterns and urban connectivity, highlighting disparities in mobility and access across different socioeconomic groups. The results identify areas functioning as hubs or bridges and illustrate how these roles changed during COVID-19, revealing existing societal inequalities. Specifically, we observed that urban parks and rural areas with national parks became significant mobility hubs during the pandemic, while affluent areas with high educational attainment saw a decline in centrality measures, indicating a shift in urban mobility dynamics and exacerbating pre-existing socioeconomic disparities.",Urban mobility,Urban spatial structure,Networks,COVID-19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To realize the highquality development of the takeaway sector, it is necessary to understand the spatial differentiation characteristics of takeaway consumption in Chinese cities and its influencing factors. To this end, we quantitatively studied the spatial distribution of takeaway consumption in 56 cities. We used the number of takeaway orders (copies/person) and the per capita takeaway consumption amount (RMB/person) in major Chinese cities in 2019 to characterize takeaway consumption in China. We investigated the driving mechanisms and factors affecting takeaway consumption amounts per capita and order per capita in China. The results show that takeaway consumption amounts per capita and order per capita is higher in East China than in North and Central China. The tertiary industry population ratio is crucial to takeaway consumption amounts per capita and order per capita in major Chinese cities. Amounts and orders increase as the tertiary industry population ratio rises. Factors affecting takeaway consumption amounts per capita and order per capita in Chinese cities of different population sizes vary. The working-age population ratio heavily influences the takeaway consumption amounts per capita and orders per capita in megacities. Additionally, internet penetration and average annual temperature play a significant role in takeaway consumption amounts per capita and orders per capita in megalopolis. In big cities I, the road capacity per capita and GDP per capita are the main factors affecting takeaway consumption amounts per capita and orders per capita. The tertiary industry population ratio is the core factor that determines takeaway consumption amounts per capita and orders per capita in big cities II. The interaction between natural and socio-economic factors dramatically increases the impact of takeaway consumption amounts per capita and order per capita in Chinese cities. In conclusion, this study provides a macro-level insight into the spatial characteristics and development factors of takeaway consumption in major Chinese cities.

The systemic complexity of these challenges renders it difficult to find solutions using existing planning processes. Alternatively, transformative planning processes are radical, take place on multiple scales, and are often irreversible; therefore, require the integration of local stakeholders' perspectives, which are often contradictory. We identify perceived levers of urban transformative change using a serious game to facilitate the integration of these perspectives through simulating neighbourhood transformation processes in two European case studies. Building on existing transformation frameworks, we organize, conceptualize, and compare the effectiveness of these levers through demonstrating their interactions with different scales of transformation. Specifically, drawing from close commonalities between large-scale (Three Spheres of Transformation) and place-based (Place-making) transformation frameworks, we show how these interactions can help to develop recommendations to unlock urban transformative change. Results show that access to participation is a key lever enabling urban transformative change. It appears to be mid-level effective to unlock urban transformative change through interactions with the political sphere of transformation and procedural element of Place-making. Ultimately, however, most effective are those levers that interact with all scales of transformation. For example, by engaging a combination of levers including access to participation, public spaces, parking, place-characteristics and place-identity. These findings could be operationalized by self-organized transformation processes focused on repurposing hard infrastructure into public spaces, whilst ensuring continuity of place-based social- and physical features. Local stakeholders could further use such processes to better understand and engage with their individual roles in the transformative process, because interactions with the personal scale, i.e., personal sphere of transformation appear paramount to unlock urban transformative change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, as a significant source of carbon emissions from tourism activities, the total carbon emissions from tourism transport have not decreased proportionally to the reduction in the intensity, despite China's overall improvement in the tourism economic efficiency. This phenomenon is commonly known as the ""rebound effect"", which means that although technological progress can achieve emission reductions by efficiency improvement, but it can also indirectly stimulate socio-economic growth and creates new energy demands, results in expected emission reductions being offset by the additional economic growth effect. Based on the multi-source data structure, this paper takes Yangtze-river delta urban agglomeration as an example, quantitatively evaluated the carbon rebound effect of tourism transport through the rebound effect measurement model; simulated the spatiotemporal dynamics evolution pattern of the carbon rebound effect in tourism transport through the spatial kernel density; extracted and identified the dominant factors of carbon rebound effect in tourism transport by the geographic detector. The conclusions summarized as follow: (1) The overall carbon emissions from tourism transport in the agglomeration primarily exhibit a weak rebound effect. (2) The carbon rebound effect is significantly influenced by spatiotemporal factors, which impact its development trend and interaction relations. (3) The level of tourism consumption exerts the greatest influence on the carbon rebound effect of tourism transport, while environmental regulation intensity is commonly employed as a measure to address the rebound effect.

Collected data on 259 con fl icts show that there are signi fi cant di ff erences between cities and con fl ict types in average estimates of duration, length and intensity of con fl icts. An analysis of the sequences in con fl icts over the development of recreational areas and in fi ll development also indicates signi fi cant diversity in the content of con fl ict episodes, but the common denominator is the active role of citizens and public authorities, with a much smaller share of the actions of developers and the fourth party. Half of the sequences are short (up to 5 - 6 actions), while long episodes with a large number of actions slightly increase the likelihood of a favorable outcome for residents.

This study aims to use multidimensional connectivity network analysis to answer the role of landscape resources as a connecting medium (represented by linear canals) penetrating the urban-rural space in urban-rural integration. First, this study proposes a framework of ""Urban-Canal-Rural"" from a multidimensional perspective. In this research, we re-examined the urban-rural differences within the region by using the canal as the central regional conduit connecting urban and rural areas. Then, an association network based on five dimensions was constructed, and the network's connectivity was detected. In light of this, the integration characteristics and factor flow mechanism of ""Urban-Canal-Rural"" were revealed. Based on the study, we identified the potential interactive advantages of urban-rural integration within the canal basin, which provides the strategy for the development of ""Urban-Canal-Rural"" integration. The study found that within the same region, ""Urban-Canal-Rural"" shows completely different correlation strengths in five dimensions, revealing that the urban-rural differences in the process of urbanization are closely related to the inadequate utilization of resources. It also confirmed the importance of multidimensional network construction in balancing the allocation of resources between urban and rural areas in the process of urban-rural integration. Finally, the relations of factor mobility and resource allocation to sustainable urban and rural development were discussed. The authors argued that core resources between rural and urban areas are the key variable in restructuring rural-urban relations to achieve sustainable development. In general, urban and rural development should maintain the integrity and balance of the regional system. Additionally, this study provides Chinese experience for the worldwide study of urban-rural sustainable development.How to scrutinize the new interaction and balance between urban and rural areas is an unavoidable topic for urban and rural development. Examining the issue of urban-rural differences in the process of urbanization from a dynamic and systematic perspective, we found a close relationship between the balance and utilization of regional resources and regional differences. This paper adopted a network analysis method and proposed a framework of ""Urban-Canal-Rural"" from a multidimensional perspective. It aimed to use multidimensional connectivity network analysis to answer the role of landscape resources as a connecting medium (represented by linear canals) penetrating the urban-rural space in urban-rural integration. Network analysis was used to grasp the whole picture of the urban-rural spatial structure and reveal the overall characteristics of the network structure to determine the optimal network connectivity and resource allocation. This method can be used to facilitate the optimization of interregional connectivity and resource allocation approaches, as well as the formulation and communication of consensus-building processes for planning and sustainable development management.

Denitrification could also be mediated by cyanobacterial aggregates, yet how this process impacts nitrogen (N) availability and the associated autotroph-heterotroph relationships within cyanobacterial aggregates has not been investigated. In this study, incubation experiments with nitrate amendment were con-ducted with Microcystis aggregates (MAs). Measurement of nitrogen contents, 16S rRNA-based microbial com-munity profiling and metatranscriptomic sequencing were used to jointly assess nitrogen turnover dynamics, as well as changes in microbial composition and gene expression. Strong denitrification potential was revealed, and maximal N removal was achieved within two days, after which the communities entered a state of severe N limitation. Changes of active microbial communities were further promoted both with regard to taxonomic composition and transcriptive activities. Expression of transportation-related genes confirmed competition for N sources by Microcystis and phycospheric communities. Strong stress response to reactive oxygen species by Microcystis was revealed. Notably, interspecific relationships among Microcystis and phycospheric communities exhibited a shift toward antagonistic interactions, particularly evidenced by overall increased expression of genes related to cell lysis and utilization of cellular materials. Patterns of fatty acid and starch metabolism also sug-gested changes in carbon metabolism and cross-feeding patterns within MAs. Taken together, this study demonstrated substantial denitrification potential of MAs, which, importantly, further induced changes in both metabolic activities and autotroph-heterotroph interactions.

This study estimated the AH in seven typical Chinese cities based on a remote sensing surface energy balance model (AHseb) and an energy consumption inventory-machine learning model (AHinv). The intensity of the surface UHI was extracted using land surface temperatures, and then the linear mixed -effects model and geographic detectors were used to analyze the driving effect of AH on the UHI. Despite the similar shapes of the spatial profile curves, the AH derived from the two models differed in both temporal and spatial charac-teristics, which was more typical in winter and in urban centers, and AHinv had a more notable central spread feature than AHseb. The AH driving effects on UHI were notably influenced by spatial and temporal heterogeneity, particularly in regions with distinct background climates. However, after controlling for the random effects of the background cli-mate, AH still exhibited a considerable enhancing effect on the UHI. AHseb outperformed AHinv in terms of linear pos-itive correlation and interpretation rate for UHI. Meanwhile, interactions with other potential factors enhanced AH driving effects. Consequently, UHI mitigation must be tailored to the local context by integrating multiple drivers, and for the heating effects of AH, it is necessary to develop specific mitigation measures by limiting the conversion of AHinv to AHseb in addition to reducing the heat production. The findings offer guidance for analyzing and optimizing urban thermal climates with a focus on AH or energy consumption control.",Anthropogenic heat,Urban heat islands,Driving analysis,Spatiotemporal heterogeneity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Mid-Yangtze River urban agglomeration (MYRUA), which is an important region for China, also faces the contradiction of balancing environmental protection and economic production. Currently, there is little discussion on low-carbon pollution research in the MYRUA in China. Therefore, this study takes the MYRUA as the research object, uses a slack-based model (SBM) and exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) to explore the spatiotemporal evolution of the industrial carbon emission efficiency (ICEE) of the MYRUA in China from 2006 to 2019, and empirically analyses the factors influencing the ICEE based on a spatial econometric model. The results show that (1) in the period 2006 - 2019, the ICEE in the MYRUA region generally exhibited a "" jagged "" trend of decreasing, then increasing until finally decreasing again. Spatially, ICEE generally exhibited a dynamic trend of being low throughout, with high -efficiency areas tending to move to the center and low-efficiency areas being scattered. (2) The global Moran ' s I coefficient for ICEE ranged between 0.002 and 0.213, with the highest Moran ' s I value and significant spatial correlation occurring in 2006, after which the value gradually decreased. On the local autocorrelation, the ICEE in 2006 exhibited an agglomeration effect and weakened after 2010. (3) In 2019, the level of industrialization (LI) and the level of external openness (LEO) in the MYRUA changed from nonsignificant to significant positive correlations, and the LEO had the largest impact. The energy consumption structure (ECS) was always significantly negatively correlated. The levels of social development (LSD) and environmental regulation (ER) changed from showing a significant positive correlation to showing a nonsignificant correlation. In conclusion, ICEE is affected by interactions of multiple factors. In the future, the ECS of the MYRUA should be continuously optimized and replaced by clean energy.

We use crowdsourced air temperature measurements in Sydney, Australia, combined with urban landscape data, Local Climate Zones (LCZ), high-resolution satellite imagery, and machine learning to explore the influence of urban form and fabric on the interaction between Ta and LST. Results show that LST and Ta have distinct spatiotemporal characteristics, and their relationship differs by season, ecological infrastructure, and building morphology. We found greater seasonal variability in LST compared to Ta, along with more pronounced intra-urban spatial variability in LST, particularly in warmer seasons. We also observed a greater temperature difference between LST and Ta in the built environment compared to the natural LCZs, especially during warm days. Natural LCZs (areas with mostly dense and scattered trees) showed stronger LST-Ta relationships compared to built areas. In particular, we observe that built areas with higher building density (where the heat vulnerability is likely more pronounced) show insignificant or negative relationships between LST-Ta in summer. Our results also indicate that surface cover, distance from the ocean, and seasonality significantly influence the distribution of hot and cold spots for LST and Ta. The spatial distribution for Ta hot spots does not always overlap with LST.

The findings indicate that regions with high building density, tall structures, and minimal vegetation exhibit greater annual average building energy consumption compared to areas with contrasting features. Temporally, the peak monthly cooling energy consumption (CEC) occurs in July (9.69 TWh), while the highest monthly heating energy consumption (HEC) is in January (17.14 TWh). The daily peak CEC typically arises at 15:00 local solar time (29,169.26 MWh), whereas the daily peak HEC generally happens at 05:00 (33,416.09 MWh). The study also examines the relationship between local climate zones (LCZs) and building energy demand, revealing that as building density or mean height increases, there is a corresponding decrease in annual average cooling and heating energy demand.

Therefore, this research collected 2000-2019 subnational-level data in China to explore the pattern of rural-vs-urban inequality in energy use per person (indicating sufficiency) and energy use intensity (EUI, indicating efficiency). Gini coefficients and disparity ratios, two social inequality measurements, were used to quantify social inequality in energy use. Fixed effect models with interaction terms were adopted to explore the impact of income, energy end-use structure, and floor area on energy use differences between rural and urban households. Gini coefficients of both energy measurements decreased by 43%-47% from 2000 to 2019, suggesting a more equitable distribution of end-use energy sufficiency and efficiency between urban and rural households. Rural-vs-urban disparity ratios showed that rural households in more provinces used more energy per person with higher EUI than urban households in 2019, compared to the pattern observed in 2000. Income in rural households had a statistically significant larger impact on energy use per person and EUI than that in urban households.

However, the inherent heterogeneity of mobility patterns results in complex geographic unit relations, diverse spatial organizational structures, and the long-tailed effect on OD flow distribution. This study proposes a novel OD flow prediction method based on graph-based deep learning (named as HMCG-LGBM). Specifically, 1) a modularity-based graph reconstruction strategy is presented for geographic unit relation augmentation by eliminating weak connections; 2) the heterogeneous spatial organization of OD flows is captured by combining the community detection approach and graph attention mechanism with the introduction of socio-economic and spatial features; and 3) a weighted loss function with distribution smoothing paradigm is developed to enhance the prediction for low-probability mobility events, addressing the challenges posed by long-tailed distributions. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets show that the predictive performance of the proposed method is significantly improved, with the RMSE and MAE reduced from the baselines by 11.1%-33.3% and 14.1%-22.2%, respectively.

Parks, street greening, and community greens play a significant role in regulating the urban microenvironment, enhancing subjective well-being, and increasing regional attractiveness. Additionally, urban greenbelts have the capacity to control urban sprawl, thereby influencing housing prices and population distribution. However, the exisiting urban models have typically addressed greenbelts and other green spaces in isolation, resulting in fragmented planning strategies. This study aims to establish a novel spatial equilibrium model that accurately assesses the socio-economic effects resulting from the combined impact of various urban green spaces. This model encompasses green infrastructure components and carefully balances their appeal against the consequent rise in housing costs. The proposed model can elucidate the latent synergistic interactions among multiple urban green policies, which enables urban policymakers to access the multifaceted impacts of greening policy combinations. and suggests that combining different urban greening policies can mitigate the negative effects of a single policy type, such as population redistribution. A case study based on empirical data from Shanghai, China, has been employed to identify the additional value associated with diverse urban green spaces. The scenario analysis suggests that combining different urban greening policies can alleviate the negative impacts of urban population relocation. These findings furnish urban planners and policymakers with novel insights to develop the distribution strategy of urban green spaces via judicious policy integration.

In this regards, the emergence of accurate data, particularly short-range photogrammetric data with high spatial and spectral resolutions has proven to be essential. Urban impervious surfaces are diverse and comopsed of disperate materials; this introduces challenges in the extraction of these surface from remote sensing images. Despite this diversity, only limited types of impervious surfaces (up to six classes) can be diffierenciated in remote sensing approaches, that is insufficient to meet the requirements of researchers, managers, and urban planners. Therefore, this study proposes a novel classification scheme to extract as much information as possible from UAVs visible and elevation data. The substantial influence of classification scheme on segmentation accuracy was assessed. To achieve this objective, a classification scheme consisting of 17 classes was developed to identify the various types of impervious surfaces present in Ahvaz (with diverse impervious surfaces), Iran. Then, UAV RGB and digital elevation model (DEM) images with 5 and 10 cm spatial resolutions, respectively, were segmented through 45 different parameter combinations in the study area. Then, the optimal parameter for segmention the urban impervious surface classes individually and collectively were selected. Finally the images were classified by two methods, namely simple and stratified, using the SVM algorithm. Results demonstrated that impervious surfaces could be accurately extracted in 16 distinct classes with error less than 20%. Image segmentation and classification based on the stratified method in comparison to simple ones improved the urban impervious surface extraction overall accuracy from 72 to 81%, while also improving the minimum user and producer accuracies from 53 and 14 percent to 55 and 62 percent, respectively.

Models are needed to provide continuous temporal and spatial coverage in ozone concentration data with a fine resolution. However, the simultaneous influence of each determinant of ozone dynamics, their spatial and temporal variations, and their interaction make the resulting dynamics of O3 concentrations difficult to understand. This study aimed to i) identify different classes of temporal dynamics of O3 at daily and 9 km2 resolution over a long-term period of 12 years, ii) identify the potential determinants of these dynamics and, iii) explore the spatial distribution of the potential classes of temporal dynamics on a spatial continuum and over about 1000 km2. Thus, 126 time series of 12-year daily ozone concentrations were classified using dynamic time warping (DTW) and hierarchical clustering (study area centered on Besancon, eastern France). The different temporal dynamics obtained differed on elevation, ozone levels, proportions of urbanized and vegetated surfaces. We identified different daily ozone temporal dynamics, spatially structured, that overlapped areas called urban, suburban and rural. Urbanization, elevation and vegetation acted as determinants simultaneously. Individually, elevation and vegetated surface were positively correlated with O3 concentrations (r = 0.84 and r = 0.41, respectively), while the proportion of urbanized area was negatively correlated with O3 (r = -0.39). An increasing ozone concentration gradient was observed from urban to rural areas and was reinforced by the elevation gradient. Rural areas were both subject to higher ozone levels (p < 0.001), least monitoring and lower predictability. We identified main determinants of the temporal dynamics of ozone concentrations.

This study presents an applied groundwater modelling project that attempts to capture the complexity and quantify the uncertainty of groundwater flow and mass transport in urban environments using recently developed methods. A python scripting approach was used for model development and preparation of a calibration constrained parameter uncertainty analysis using the iterative ensemble smoother method (IES). Water supply and sewer infrastructure locations were explicitly included in the numerical model as boundary conditions with adjustable parameters during the calibration. The model calibration, and predictive uncertainty analysis considered more than 100,000 independent parameters, which were applied at zones, pilot points and directly on the model grid to define model properties, boundary conditions, and initial conditions. Calibration observations included both water level and concentration measurements at 18 boreholes over the 12-year operational life of a remediation system. The IES method was applied to calibrate 120 alternative and equally plausible parameter realizations. Initial parameter values were produced from initial statistical distributions defined by parameter bounds and based on the conceptual hydrogeological model, literature review and spatial correlations of hydraulic properties observed in well tests. The Amazon EC2 cloud computing service was used to provide the parallel computing capacity necessary to complete the project within a reasonable timeframe. Predictions of long-term mass transport towards a creek after the termination of active remediation were made with 47 of the resulting IES calibrated parameter sets. The IES method provided a distribution of potential impacts and allowed decisions about the future of the current remediation system to be made based on a quantitative, statistical, risk-based analysis. The extremely high degree of model parameterization allowed the complexity and uncertainty of an urban groundwater systems to be represented using adjustable model parameters, which reduced the likelihood of structural model error and biased predictions. This study found that fully python scripted model development and calibration setup, combined with IES, successfully allowed for improved representation of urban groundwater systems in numerical models.

However, these measurements are not directly applicable to the mapping of directional urban networks during unexpected events, such as COVID-19. Since nighttime light (NTL) data offer a unique opportunity to track near real-time human activities, the radiation model, traditionally used for routine situations only, was modified to measure directional urban networks using NTL data under three scenarios: the routine scenario (before the Shanghai lockdown), the COVID-19 scenario (during the Shanghai lockdown), and the extreme scenario (without Shanghai's participation).

However, limited research has been conducted to explore practical strategies for enhancing ecosystem services threatened by urban development, particularly in plateau cities with constrained natural resources. Xining, the largest and most densely urbanized city on the Tibetan Plateau in China, faces a significant conflict between urban expansion and ecosystem service conservation that is limited by an uninhabitable climate and mountainous topography. It is the only central city on the Tibetan Plateau, with a population of 2.47 million (2020). From 2000 to 2020, the urban area expanded by 37.42%; thus, reconciling the escalating demand for natural resources driven by urban development and promoting synergistic development between ecosystem services and urbanization remains a challenge. Here, we propose a modeling framework to reconstruct ecosystem service values using improved temporal ( p i ) and spatial ( d i ) difference indices, highlighting the temporal sensibility and spatial aggregation of multiple ecosystem services. The material quantities ( d i ) and monetary values ( p i ) of seven ecosystem services were estimated using experimentally verified local parameters as a case study in Xining from 2000 to 2020. The green infrastructure network and its interactions were identified based on the reconstructed ecosystem service value using the gravity modeling toolbox proposed in our previous study. The results illustrated that the identified green infrastructure network comprised 48 ecological sources and 96 corridors, covering an area of 162318.3 hm 2 ; while this includes approximately onefifth of the total study area, but it contributes to one-third of the overall ecosystem service value. The conservation priority and planning construction areas in the Xining City Master Planning (2021 -2035) outlines were then optimized based on the identified green infrastructure network. Overall, these optimized urban planning scenarios would reserve 59.3 million CNY of the reconstructed ecosystem service value encroached on by urban sprawl. The opportunity cost is transferring 14.7% of the planned construction area overlapping with the green infrastructure network. This study provides a distinctive example for establishing a green infrastructure network based on the spatiotemporal dynamic sensitivity of ecosystem services and provides a strong reference for sustainable development and ecosystem service conservation, particularly in plateau cities.",Ecology landscape network,Gravity model,Temporal and spatial differences of ecosystem services,Urbanization,Urban planning,Urban green space,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This transformation will likely lead to stronger links between both sectors, which may have both desired and undesirable consequences. However, current policies are predominantly sectoral and tend to assume only a positive impact of the transformation of the energy-mobility nexus on urban sustainability. We conducted a systematic literature review, which covered 78 articles, to identify the interactions between the transformations of urban energy and mobility systems, their impacts on various aspects of sustainability and equity, and the relevant policies that target the nexus. The results show that the positive impacts of the transformation of the urban energy-mobility nexus are outnumbered by negative impacts on various aspects of sustainability and equity. A major equity issue concerns a possible reinforcement of socio-spatial inequalities in access to renewable self-production of electricity, electric vehicles, their integration, and the associated benefits. In conclusion, the issue of socio-spatial inequalities should be a priority for further research and policy development, given the currently limited understanding of these equity risks and the growing emphasis on the need for a just transition.",energy,mobility,urban,electric,sustainability,vehicle,renewable,power,impacts,policy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,transformation,nexus,equity,,,

This study introduces a resilience index that magnifies the ""unaveraged clues"" of changes in Origin-Destination (OD) pairs to quantify the spatially unequal response of Seoul public transit use to external shocks from 2020 to 2023. Our findings reveal spatial heterogeneity in the resilience index of OD pairs and the dynamic change of related factors. OD pairs with high resilience during the outbreak were often associated with long-distance and labour-intensive industries, highlighting the need for transit systems to cater to ""captive"" travellers during the outbreaks. Despite overall ridership recovery in Seoul, factors like car ownership and the diversity of spatial functionality continued to influence patterns, which suggests that transit systems should focus on improving attractiveness to regain lost passengers post-pandemic.

CA-DUSRM uses an improved nonlinear reservoir algorithm to simulate the generation of surface runoff outflow at grid cell scale and flow interactions among cells. The CA-DUSRM simulation results (total surface runoff and peak discharge) for an asphalt road sub-catchment during different rainfall events were in good agreement with actual measurements of both surface runoff and rainfall processes. The performance of CA-DUSRM was comprehensively and systematically analyzed under different rainfall-terrain scenarios. The results showed that increasing the temporal grain resulted in uncertain simulation results in relation to the rainfall intensity, slope, and terrain undulation employed; and significant spatial grain effects were mainly caused by large terrain undulation changes. Compared with the storm water management model (SWMM), CA-DUSRM performed better overall and was more sensitive to variation in terrain undulation and fluctuations in rainfall. Based on model structure and simulation mechanism perspectives, CA-DUSRM can present the influence of spatially heterogeneous underlying surface characteristics on the runoff processes and describe the lateral water exchanges, which makes the simulated processes closer to the actual processes when compared with SWMM.

U-S-R transition zones (U-S-RTZ) are also highlighting the function diversity and landscape heterogeneity across territorial spaces. As a super megacity in western China, Chengdu's rapid urbanization has driven the evolution of U-S-R spaces, resulting in a sequential structure. To promote the high-quality spatial development of urban-rural region in a structured and efficient manner, it is essential to conduct a scientific examination of the multidimensional interconnection within the U-S-RTZ framework. By proposing a novel identification method of U-S-RTZ and taking Chengdu, China as a case study, grounded in a blender of natural and humanistic factors, this study quantitatively delineated and explored the spatial evolutions of U-S-RTZ and stated the optimization orientation and sustainable development strategies of the production-living-ecological spaces along the U-S-R gradients. The results show that: 1) it is suitable for the quantitative analysis of U-S-RTZ by established three-dimensional identification system in this study. 2) In 1990-2020, the urban-suburban transition zones (U-STZ) in Chengdu have continuously undergone a substantial increase, and the scale of the suburban-rural transition zones (S-RTZ) has continued to expand slightly, while the space of rural-ecological transition zones (R-ETZ) has noticeably compressed. 3) The landuse dynamics within U-S-RTZ has gradually increased in 1990-2020.

However, the driving mechanism of this unbalance is unclear, and the determination of ecological compensation standard (ECS) is not unified. This study uses the ecological footprint (EF) model and integrated inversion model to complete the intelligent evaluation and prediction of ecological supply-demand performance in the BTHUA. The extended nonlinear STIRPAT model and geographic detector are integrated to identify the driving mechanism of EF and its spatial differentiation. ECS at different spatiotemporal scales are then given with consideration of ecological service value and Monte Carlo simulation. Results reveal that EF of the BTHUA exhibits a downward trend, especially under the sustainable scenario (SSP1), falling by 16.85 %. But all cities would be still in unsafety states by 2035, with an average EF value of 6.210 hm2/cap, which is over 27 times greater than its EC. The spatial distribution of EF differs significantly, and high-value areas gradually migrate to the north. The variation of EF is primarily influenced by industrial structure, with population factors and environmental factors following. Per capita GDP is a key factor causing spatial differentiation of EF. The key driving factors and their explanatory powers on EF vary across cities, and the interaction of multiple factors affects EF more than a single in the BTHUA. Past-to-future ECS of the BTHUA shows a decreasing trend, with high-value areas distributed in the pivotal cities for economic development. A total of 19.13 x 1010 CNY needs to be paid to compensate for ecological damage of the BTHUA. Uncertainty analysis shows that ECS is extremely sensitive to grassland footprint in most cities. Furthermore, environmental footprints as well as system dynamics considering multiple factors are still required for comprehensively evaluating the ecological environment quality and further exploring ecological compensation evaluation framework with incorporating various ecological service functions such as carbon sinks in the BTHUA.

A conceptual framework of air pollutant emission in urban economic growth (APEUEG) was proposed to explore the interaction patterns in China from 2007 to 2017. The empirical analysis revealed that a N-shaped EKC exists between aerosol optical depth (AOD) and gross domestic product (GDP), with inflection points of $5000 and $27,000, respectively. Therefore, we speculated that when GDP per capita of a city exceeded $5000, the AOD gradually decreased. However, when GDP per capita of a city gained over $27,000, the economic growth and the atmospheric environment would be coordinated steadily. The interaction of EG-AE experienced three stages-pollution, improvement, and coordination-in China. Spatially, the interaction patterns of EG-AE presented five clusters, which were associated with the spatial distribution of city levels. China's prefecture-level cities have undergone the cluster of low AOD-low GDP (LL), the cluster of high AOD-high GDP (HH), and the cluster of low AOD-high GDP (LH), as urban level improves.

We evaluated the theory that police violence against minority residents serves as a process of containment and ultimately supports the continued generation of wealth by a specific sector of society through the process of gentrification. The cycle of destruction and renewal in the urban landscape is deeply intertwined with processes of capital accumulation, class differentiation, and racial subordination. Both the West Florida and Southeast Florida areas contained a significantly higher proportion of fatal encounters occurring within tracts that were eligible to gentrify than in tracts that were in the process of gentrifying.

We address this using a hedonic property analysis with data from Baltimore, Maryland. Both Ordinary Least Square and Spatial Lag models were conducted, all including interaction terms between tree canopy cover and various site factors. Our results indicated that, on average, the amount of tree canopy in the 100-400 zone around a single-family property is positively associated with home price. We also find that the marginal impact of canopy on property price increases for properties that are larger in lot size and closer to downtown Baltimore. Model results were mixed in terms of the interactive effects of crime and proximity to major roadway with tree canopy. We suggest that the benefits that tree canopy provides in the form of added privacy, reduced urban heat, noise and pollution may influence these price increases. These findings may signal concerns about the potential for urban greening to contribute to gentrification. In a competitive housing market, those with the capacity to afford to pay more for urban tree canopy and the benefits it provides such as a cooler downtown environment, privacy on larger lots, or reduced noise and pollution from a major roadway may price out those who are unable to pay this urban tree canopy premium.

Understanding and planning for the aftermath of the COVID-19 may not only minimize detrimental effects but also provide insights into the economic recovery policies. This study analyzes the phenomenon of restaurant failures after the pandemic in Shenzhen, China via percolation in multilayer complex networks. We identify the closed restaurants through data mining, and construct the human mobility network through mobile phone location data, aggregating origin and destination points into grids. We then embedded the restaurants' Points of Interest (POIs) into the grids, creating an additional restaurant network layer. By considering spatial interactions between restaurants, we constructed a geographical proximity network for restaurants in each grid. Finally, Using these multilayered nested networks, we analyzed the pandemic's impact and the occurrence of critical phenomena related to restaurant closures under lockdown policies through percolation in multilayer complex networks. As a result, this study found that the severity of the pandemic significantly increased the probability of restaurant failures, with cascade and critical phenomena. However, implementing precise lockdown measures can effectively lower the probability of restaurant closures. These results highlight the effectiveness of accurate lockdown policies in striking a balance between epidemic prevention and economic development, contingent upon the correct identification of high-risk areas.

This is done to understand how they respond to the alteration, preservation, and degradation after getting transported and deposited in sediment. Thirteen surface sediment samples of the Gomati River floodplain were analyzed for palynofacies and grain size to ascertain its fate in this reach, which comprises the big picture for past human settlement. The shifts in the proportions of palynofacies associations, i.e., phytoclasts, palynomorphs, and amorphous organic matter (AOM) along with grain size, are considered to visualize the depositional process. The CONISS cluster analysis revealed four zones reflecting high degradation and alteration of palynofacies in the urban regime compared to the sub -urban reaches where the low interference with natural settings illustrates the low deterioration of palynofacies.

In this study, state-of-the-art data-driven methods for modal analysis of simplified urban flows are used to study the dominant flow processes in these environments. Higher order dynamic mode decomposition (HODMD), a highly-efficient method to analyze turbulent flows, is used together with traditional techniques such as proper-orthogonal decomposition (POD) to analyze high-fidelity simulation data of a simplified urban environment. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal Koopman decomposition (STKD) will be applied to the temporal modes obtained with HODMD to perform spatial analysis. The flow interaction within the canopy influences the flow structures, particularly the arch vortex. The latter is a vortical structure generally found downstream of wall-mounted obstacles, which is generated as a consequence of flow separation. Therefore, the main objective of the present study is to characterize the mechanisms that promote these phenomena in urban areas with different geometries. Remarkably, among all the vortical structures identified by the HODMD algorithm, low-and high-frequency modes are classified according to their relation with the arch vortex. They are referred to as vortex-generator and vortex-breaker modes, respectively. This classification implies that one of the processes driving the formation and destruction of major vortical structures in between the buildings is the interaction between low-and high-frequency structures. The high energy revealed by the POD for the vortex-breaker modes points to this destruction process as the mechanism driving the flow dynamics. Furthermore, the results obtained with the STKD method show how the generating-and breaking-mechanisms originated along with the streamwise and spanwise directions.",CFD,Urban flow,High-fidelity LES,POD,Machine-learning methods,Data-driven methods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nine landscape planning indicators affecting urban area carbon emissions, four indicators affecting green space carbon sinks, and three indicators affecting the urban-green space ecotonal relationship and the carbon budget are derived. We analyze the causes of the differences between the studies and discuss the influences of the indicators on emission reduction, carbon sink increases, and sustainable development.

Moreover, the spatial-temporal distributions of both CUHII and heat waves exhibited heterogeneously. In dense urban areas (e.g., LCZ 1 and 2), the blocking effect of dense high-rise buildings, and poor ventilation with low wind speeds would exacerbate urban excess warming, which exhibited relatively higher occurrence of heat waves and an increase in the CUHII. By contrast, over open areas of the urban periphery (eg., LCZ5), more heat wave events and stronger CUHII were mainly affected by the horizontal advective transport of urban heat at medium wind speeds. Particularly, the sea breezes could weaken the CUHII and decrease the occurrence frequency of heat wave events during daytime over coastal areas. In addition, the shading effects of high-rise buildings and the evaporative cooling effects of water and vegetation would also mitigate urban warming at the local scale, which would reduce the CUHII as well as the frequency of heat waves.",Canopy urban heat island,Heat waves,Local climate zones,Urban ventilation,Sea breezes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Urban development yields intertwining and interdependent functional areas for residence, commerce, and education, which leads to complex but regular population mobility patterns. Population mobility spaces can effectively represent the actual service scopes of urban functions. Therefore, in this study, we propose a function-associated population mobility network (FPMN) to dynamically delineate the service capacities of urban functions, and to quantify the driving effects of urban functions on population mobility under spatial interaction conditions. By integrating the cumulative opportunities of geographic nodes with the potential opportunities reflected by population mobility, k-step function accessibility with population mobility (k-step PFA) is defined in FPMN to characterize the accessibility relationships between geographic nodes and function nodes. Based on k-step PFA, considering the complementarity and intervention opportunities, the function-driven index (FDI) is proposed to quantify the driving effects of urban functions on population mobility. Our experimental results indicated that FPMN could effectively represent the actual service scopes and capabilities of urban functions. Compared with general location-based accessibility indicators, k-step PFA has a higher numerical distribution and less spatial disparity, and it aligns more closely with the actual service scopes of urban functions.

The underlying data consists of field observations, interviews with road users, geolocalized event registrations, video tracking data, and responses to open-ended surveys. The synthesis suggests that 1) dynamic negotiation of space and timing, 2) handling of situational and traffic system ambiguity, and 3) human road user learning, go beyond what should simply be attributed to a transitory immaturity of the technology.

However, landscape patterns and landscape-related variables driving pharmaceutical pollution in peri-urban watersheds with rapid urbanization remain poorly understood. Herein, we investigated the occurrence and spatiotemporal distribution of 28 pharmaceuticals and their potential influencing factors in a peri-urban watershed (Zhangxi River Watershed) in Zhejiang province, Eastern China. Paraxanthine (detection frequency 97 %, mean concentration 223.07 ng/L) and anhydro-erythromycin (95 %, 4.01 ng/L) were the most prevalent compounds. Total pharmaceutical concentrations (sum of all target compounds) were significantly higher in the wet season (summer and autumn) than in the dry season (spring and winter; P < 0.05). Information theoretic-based analysis revealed that landscape pattern and dissolve organic matter were the main drivers of watershed-scale pharmaceutical pollution rather than water quality parameters and topographic characteristics. Correlation analysis showed that total pharmaceutical concentrations were more highly correlated with landscape pattern during the dry season than the wet season. The importance analysis and indicator interaction analysis revealed that interspersion and juxtaposition index (IJI), mean patch size (AREA-MN), patch density (PD), terrestrial humic-like substances C2, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) played a vital role in the occurrence and distribution of pharmaceutical in the watershed.

The park cool island intensity (PCII), the temperature difference between outside and inside a park, is a widely used indicator of a park's cooling ability. Understanding the driving factors of the PCII is crucial for better urban park planning and management. Taking the subtropical city of Changsha, China, as a case study, factors such as the landscape patterns inside and outside a park and the geometric morphology of a park were investigated, based on 153 urban parks. A novel simultaneous equation modeling (SEM) approach was used to account for the mutual interactions between the temperatures of a park and its buffer. The results show that: (1) Park geometric morphology and landscape patterns inside and outside the park all significantly impact the PCII. Specifically, doubling the park size can increase the PCII by 0.8 K. Increasing by ten percent the tree cover and water cover in the park can enhance the PCII by 0.12 K and 0.41 K, respectively. Increasing the mean tree patch size by 1 ha can increase the PCII by 0.43 K. Decreasing by one unit the mean tree patch shape index can increase the PCII by 0.31 K.

To enhance the PCII, we recommend building parks in the hot areas of the city, increasing their size, increasing the percentages of tree cover and water cover in the park, and optimizing the spatial configuration of the tree cover in the park (i.e., aggregating trees in a smaller number of large patches and reducing the irregularity of tree patches).",Urban parks,Cool island intensity,Landscape morphology,Thermal environment,Simultaneous equation modeling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this task remains challenging as accurate forecasting depends on properly representing urban surfacees and their interactions with the planetary boundary layer (PBL). We examined the hindcast of an extreme precipitation event over Beijing on 21-22 July 2012. The primary focus was assessing its sensitivity to two widely used PBL parameterizations (MYJ and YSU), two urban parameterizations (SLUCM and BEP_BEM), and two different land-use and land-cover (LULC) datasets. Sensitivity experiments were initialized at different times to explore the model dependence on initial conditions. The analyses were conducted over three selected regions: the entire model domain covering the Beijing metropolitan area, an upwind region of Beijing, and the entire urban area of Beijing. The results show that the MYJ PBL scheme performs better than the YSU PBL scheme in capturing near-surface air temperature as well as the location and timing of the heaviest precipitation. The variability in simulated precipitation among the chosen PBL schemes is lower compared to that among different time of initializations. The LULC impacted the spatial distribution of precipitation but its effect on the amount of precipitation was minimal. Overall, using a combination of the MYJ PBL scheme, SLUCM urban parameterization, and locally-enhanced Beijing LULC, and initializing the model simulations at 0000 UTC July 20, 2012, demonstrated superior performance in capturing precipitation levels, despite some spatial discrepancies in the precipitation distribution.

This analysis thus well-indicates that merely supplying greater amount of commodities of any kind does not necessarily reflect greater complementarity and vice versa.

The urban agglomeration on the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains (UANSTM) is a typical arid inland emerging urban agglomeration, and the relationship between human activities and the ecological environment here is very sensitive. To reveal the spatiotemporal changes in ecological quality in the UANSTM from 2000 to 2020, this study used Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, calculating remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) based on the MODIS data products, in addition to achieving an ecological space atlas based on the Land-Use and Land-Cover Change (LUCC) data sets. At same time, the geographical detector model (GDM) has been used to exploring the main influencing factor of RSEI. The result shows that 1) The mean value of RESI in the study area continued to rise in the first 15 a and decreased slightly in the last 5 a. 2) In the past 20 a, the area of improvement obvious (IO) has gradually expanded, and the proportion has gradually increased. The sum of the areas of deterioration obvious (DO) and deterioration slight (DS) is far smaller than the sum of the areas of improvement slight (IS) and improvement obvious (IO), which indicates that the ecological quality of UANSTMN is tends to improve. 3) The distribution of ecological space in the study area is ecological used land (EL) > semi-ecological used land (SEL) > weak ecological used land (WEL). The area of EL is gradually decreasing, while the area of SEL and WEL is gradually increasing. 4) In the past 20 a, the main influencing factor of RSEI in the study area is greenness, and the interaction of heat, dryness, and greenness had a more obvious effect on RSEI.

Nest site selection is a pivotal point in the process of habitat selection and breeding for bird species. We measured 10 structural and spatial characteristics at 32 nest presence sites and 64 randomly selected nest absence sites of Laughing Doves (Spilopelia senegalensis) in an urban environment in Karaj, Iran. To model the nest site selection, we performed spline binary logistic regression. Two variables significantly influenced the nest site selection of Laughing Doves: nest height above ground, with an optimal range of similar to 286-347 cm, and nest concealment, favoring invisible places from the front and sides. Distance to opposite building, with an optimal range of similar to 16-34 m, was marginally significant. Additionally, we surveyed the feasibility of occupying artificial nestboxes (n = 17) by Laughing Doves between February and September 2019. The occupancy rate of the artificial nestboxes was similar to 35%. Overall, these results suggest that despite the relatively high structural heterogeneity of our urban environment, Laughing Doves exhibit distinct preferences for certain nest site characteristics, which may reflect a dependence on close proximity to humans for safety and access to food and water.",human-animal interaction,nestbox,nest site preferences,spline,urban bird behavior,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study demonstrates the significance of strategies such as limiting built-up areas, preserving and expanding green and open spaces, and protecting water resources on health and urban carrying capacity in arid and semi-arid regions. This research is founded on the system dynamics model and aims to demonstrate, quantitatively and qualitatively, the interactions that affect urban carrying capacity between 2021 and 2040 in Tehran. The mean absolute percent error (MAPE), the coefficient of determination (R2), and the relative error (RE) all play a role in determining simulation accuracy. RE is less than 15 %, MAPE is less than 5 %, and R2 is more than 0.5, indicating that the system dynamics model adequately describes the actual behaviors. The results of the status quo scenario show that the current management policies will cause substantial damage to the environment, urban carrying capacity, and landscape subsystems and drive the system to an unsustainable level of water resources. In this scenario, between 2021 and 2040, water demand and built-up area increased by 26.26 % and 70.29 %, respectively, and in 2026, the Water Sustainability Index (WSI) will decline below 0.1, indicating that the water reserve cannot support the water demand after 2025. This study demonstrates that cities in arid and semi-arid regions cannot sustain continuous growth and physical development without considering the health of the primary carriers, such as spatial and water resources. In terms of health and urban carrying capacity, implementing a combination of policies aimed at enhancing urban green and open spaces and regulating water demand was the most effective.

Disentanglement of the complex pathways of urban design, environmental exposures, and health, and the magnitude of these associations, remains a challenge. A state-of-the-art account of large-scale urban health studies is required to shape future research priorities and equity- and evidence -informed policies. Objectives: The purpose of this review was to synthesise evidence from large-scale urban studies focused on the interaction between urban form, transport, environmental exposures, and health. This review sought to determine common methodologies applied, limitations, and future opportunities for improved research practice. Methods: Based on a literature search, 2958 articles were reviewed that covered three themes of: urban form; urban environmental health; and urban indicators. Studies were prioritised for inclusion that analysed at least 90 cities to ensure broad geographic representation and generalisability. Of the initially identified studies, following expert consultation and exclusion criteria, 66 were included. Results: The complexity of the urban ecosystem on health was evidenced from the context dependent effects of urban form variables on environmental exposures and health. Compact city designs were generally advantageous for reducing harmful environmental exposure and promoting health, with some exceptions. Methodological heterogeneity was indicative of key urban research challenges; notable limitations included exposure and health data at varied spatial scales and resolutions, limited availability of local -level sociodemographic data, and the lack of consensus on robust methodologies that encompass best research practice. Conclusion: Future urban environmental health research for evidence -informed urban planning and policies requires a multi -faceted approach.

Taking seven WSMCs in Chongqing, China, as the study area, this study aimed to investigate the soundscape and explore the influence of spatial characteristics and visual and smell environments on the soundscape of WSMCs through a sensewalking approach. The results show that the soundscape evaluations of WSMCs are of poor quality, and traffic sounds are dominant (33%). Among spatial characteristics, the position relative to the road (including vertical and horizontal distances) had a greater impact than other spatial indicators on soundscape evaluations. Elevation was positively correlated with the A-weighted equivalent sound level (L-Aeq) and negatively correlated with the soundscape comfort degree (SCD). In terms of visual elements, the proportions of paved ground, pedestrians, and buildings had negative effects on the soundscape, while those of the sky, water, and natural terrain had positive effects. High visual and smell environment quality can enhance soundscape evaluations, although the smell environment had a greater impact on the SCD than the visual environment in WSMCs.

In the present study, we used spatial indices to assess the tree cover of green areas in residential blocks and whether this would be sufficient to influence local thermal comfort. Information on the size of green areas, composition and frequency of species and canopy diameter was obtained to calculate the tree density indices -ADI and shading -ISA.

Interactions among these ecosystems are self-sustainable if these are unaltered. But, due to rapid urban expansion, changes in land use land cover (LULC), and anthropogenic activities, these ecosystem services (ES) are exerted with tremendous pressure. Hence, ecosystem services are unable to maintain the terrestrial equilibrium, causing changes in hydro-meteorological phenomena. Therefore, the aim to manage the ecosystem in a sustainable way, insufficient knowledge construct about the factors influencing ecosystem services at a regional level is a major concern. The researchers use conventional data collection methods to analyze the ecosystem service like surveying and sampling, which directs the researcher to implement a statistical model. These models are efficient in forming the correlation among a few variables but are not considered to be functionally viable. Policy decisions are based on the details that elaborate on the critical aspects of unseen trade-offs and synergies amidst ecosystem services.

Promoting their benign development is the key to realizing global sustainable development of urban and rural areas. Planning control is based on precisely defining the spatial extent of suburban areas, and understanding suburban area differentiation and its driving forces scientifically is a key component in raising the bar for focused planning. However, there are currently few research on fine-scale quantitative identification of suburban regions because of their spatial complexity, ambiguous boundaries, and structural dynamic features. Based on this, this paper develops a multi-dimensional identification index system for suburban areas by using multi-source big data and remote sensing information technology, employs the random forest model and the K-Medoids clustering algorithm, identifies the distribution of suburban areas and their subdivided types, analyzes spatial differentiation characteristics, and conducts empirical research using Chengdu City as an example. The findings demonstrate that: (1) The majority of suburban areas in Chengdu City are concentrated in groups or belts surrounding the urban centers of various districts and counties, and the higher the functional class of a district or county, the denser the distribution of suburban areas. (2)The distribution pattern of suburban areas in Chengdu basically conforms to its planned urban hierarchy system.(3)Urban-oriented, suburban-interacted and rural-oriented suburban areas have their own characteristics in land use level, economic development and regional population characteristics.(4)Regional openness, government behavior, social development and geographical location are the core driving factors of spatial differentiation of suburban areas in Chengdu, and the interaction between urban and rural systems, the flow of social resources and the transformation of development models are the spatial mapping dimensions that affect its differentiation.(5)Chengdu can draw up detailed regulatory planning of suburban units to standardize and guide the overall development of suburban areas.

The second section presents recent policy from the Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD) of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Government or Hong Kong Government). These documents describe an inherently conflictual strategy for Tai O Village: infrastructure investment, research and development funding, and publicly funded tourism publicity to incentivise development growth that colonial legacy policies simultaneously constrain. The third section explores informal settlement land tenure in Hong Kong as a historical phenomenon. We present scholarship on colonial-era policy and censuses that contribute to the present dilemma in which, anticipating precedented clearance actions, stakeholders, and administrators must determine ways forward for informally developed settlements. The fourth section reviews squatter control and regularisation efforts in informal settlement improvement or regularisation projects elsewhere to contextualise these inherent dilemmas and suggest, as this article's thesis, that third sector and design-led efforts are applicable, interstitial methods to respond to such legacy problems.

Consequently, urban forest soils emerge as effective NBS, underscoring their potential to mitigate environmental challenges and foster sustainable urban ecosystems. In these sense, this manuscript aimed at evaluating how soil attributes of the urban forests of S & atilde;o Paulo, Brazil, with different adjacent land uses, influence the capacity to store the excess of C and N from anthropogenic emissions, making this ecosystem an important reservoir of urban anthropogenic emissions. Three hundred urban forest soil samples were collected from the surface to a depth of 50 cm. All samples were analyzed for C and N content (and their stable isotopes). In addition, granulometric tests were also carried out to classify the soils. It was found that the most central forest fragment has the highest C and N contents at all analyzed depths, probably due to the association with physical aspects of soil texture. For all layers, the most central fragment soil sample, the only one with a clay soil, presented approximately twice as many elements when compared to the soil samples of the other sites. In general, C and N stocks (and their stable isotopes, delta C-13 and delta N-15, respectively) varied significantly in forests located in the center-periphery direction (%N - F = 24.58, p < 0.05; %C - F = 22.48, p < 0.05; delta N-15 - F = 4.27, p < 0.05; delta C-13 - F = 19.8, p < 0.05; C/N - F = 14.56, p < 0.05). This more central forest fragment with higher vehicle emissions showed greater potential to store these atmospheric elements and with greater neutralizing efficiency than the other forest fragments. delta C-13 and delta N-15 contents together with the C:N ratio indicated the efficiency of biogeochemical cycling, through decomposition, in different urban forest fragments. More peripheral fragments showed high efficiency in C and N cycling along the analyzed soil profiles, while in the most superficial layer, the most central fragment was highly efficient.

In this study, we attempted to characterize the ESs balance pattern and its spatio-temporal variation from 2000 to 2020 at multiple scales in the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomerations (CCUA), using ESs matrix and hotspot analysis tools. We then introduced the optimal parametric geographic detector to detect the formation mecha-nism of the spatial differentiation pattern of ESs balance. The results show that the overall ESs supply index for CCUA was greater than the demand index. The ESs were in short supply in Chengdu and Chongqing. The pattern of ESs balance had significant scale dependence. The hot spots of the ESs balance index were mainly in the western, southern, and eastern mountainous regions, while the cold spots were concentrated in urban areas of Chengdu and Chongqing, with significant differences in characteristics at different scales. The spatial distribution of the ESs balance was mainly affected by the forest land proportion, slope, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), elevation, cultivated land proportion, and temperature. The interaction of natural, land use, and socio-economic factors significantly enhanced the spatial differentiation of ESs balance. The interaction of different types of factors highlights the importance of topography, NDVI, cultivated land, forest land, and population.

While this can be traced back to market oriented planning agendas, the increasing fragmentation of the public realm in cities can be linked to the recent residential development projects. The rise of these projects in post Soviet neighbourhoods is often criticised due to their typology, as developers create them as gated communities. These patterns' socio and spatial fragmentation is associated with fewer opportunities for social interaction between Soviet neighbourhoods and the more recent exclusive communities. Therefore, this paper investigates the key issues present in the urban patterns of Almaty city that can hinder the creation of a more cohesive society. It presents a case study of other Soviet-developed neighbourhoods with similar development patterns. The study's methodology includes morphological mapping, observation of the use of the public realm and a survey of residents to support the findings. The investigation focuses on one of the typical urban patterns of mixed-use Soviet neighbourhoods and recent urban residential blocks, where an opportunity lies for perspective communities. The research reveals a lack of social cohesion between local communities due to mono functional land use, poor permeability and accessibility that fragmented the city into closed neighbourhoods. The research dives into the core issues of Soviet and post-Soviet urban morphology's outcomes in the public realm and the impact on social life in these neighbourhoods.",Almaty,development projects,public realm,social cohesion,urban pattern,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of this research is to reveal the vulnerability of a human-environment coupled system and its interaction mechanisms amidst a changing environment. This study started with the vulnerability scoping diagram (VSD) conceptual model and built up a research framework of territorial spatial vulnerability according to the three structural elements of ecological protection, agricultural production and urban construction. Following the re-quirements for intelligent computing, we introduced particle swarm optimization and BP neural network learning algorithms to evaluate the vulnerability of Shenzhen's territory. We also introduced flow cytometry to analyze the mechanism of Shenzhen's territorial spatial vulnerability driven by human and natural forces. The results showed that the territorial spatial vulnerability of Shenzhen was low under various functional orienta-tions. Among them, ecological protection-oriented territorial spatial vulnerability was high in the west and low in the east and followed an inverted U-shaped trend in the north-south direction. Agricultural production -oriented territorial spatial vulnerability was high in the east and low in the west, high in the north and low in the south. Urban construction-oriented territorial spatial vulnerability was high in the west and low in the east, high in the north and low in the south. Under the complex orientation of the gigantic human-environment coupled system, the vulnerability of territory was symmetrical and balanced in the north-south direction and fluctuated with an overall declining trend in the east-west direction.

Understanding the driving factors behind these emissions is crucial for effective pollution control and environmental management. Therefore, this study is an attempt to provide insights into the influence of socioeconomic factors and explore spatial dependencies of NOx emissions in China in 2022 employing spatial regression models (SRMs). Among the SRMs considered, the spatial Durbin model (SDM) is identified as the most suitable for analyzing regional NOx emissions. The study highlights the importance of controlling electricity consumption and vehicle emissions for addressing air pollution in Chinese regions. Specifically, a one billion kilowatt-hour increase in electricity consumption leads to approximately 549.6 tons of NOx emissions, and an increase of 1000 vehicles in a region results in an average increase of 7113.4 tons of NOx emissions in the same region. Furthermore, per capita consumption expenditure (PCEXP) and research and development (R&D) expenditure exhibit negative direct and spillover impacts. Contrary to previous studies, this research finds that changes in urban population density do not have a significant direct or indirect effect on NOx emissions within the studied areas. Moreover, we conducted additional investigations to assess the effectiveness of government action plans in reducing NOx emissions. Specifically, we evaluated the impact of Phases 1 and 2 of the Clean Air Action Plan, launched in 2013 and 2018, respectively, on the socioeconomic drivers of NOx emissions. Therefore, the data were modeled for the years 2013 and 2017 and compared to the results obtained for 2022. The findings indicate that over the entire period (2013-2022), the emission controls mandated by the action plan resulted in significant reductions in the impact of many of the studied NOx drivers.

As a characterization of differences in the degree of interaction between residents and UGS, Green exposure equity, has been recognized as an environmental justice issue. In this study, we propose the concept of urban green space' vitalization (UGV) as a primary criterion for assessing whether the UGS' functions or services are realized. Taking Shanghai, China as a case study, we developed an assessment system for UGV, and quantified UGV's availability to examine the impact on green exposure equity. Our research shows that 1000 m is the optimal service radius to determine whether UGS vitality is realized. All UGS in the central regions of Shanghai have realized their vitality, while areas devoid of vitality are mainly located in the non-central. Compared to UGS, the availability of UGV in Shanghai was cumulatively reduced by 321.07 km2, 10,812.61 km2, and 197,496.54 km2 for walking, public transport, and driving modes, respectively. In the non-central regions, the minimum green availability per capita for walking and public transport modes was reduced to 0 ha.

Aerosol optical properties observed at 37 typical AERONET sites are selected as the testbed, including marine, desert dust, clean continent, urban industry, and biomass burning sites. Results show that marine and desert dust aerosols are the most effectively identified types, while urban industry and biomass burning aerosols overlap much in the identification spaces since they contain similar chemical components. Dust and marine aerosol generally have the best agreement among the four identification methods, because desert dust and marine particles have distinctive chemical components from other kinds, thus the category setting from the perspective of emission source, light absorbing ability, or chemical components has less influence on the identification results. Spatial correlation between the four commonly -used aerosol identification methods futher refines the correspondence of aerosol category, light absorption capacity, and chemical components.

This study proposes a Carbon Pressure Index (CPI) to assess the equilibrium between emissions and sequestration, determine the factors influencing varying carbon pressure levels, and formulate region-specific strategies based on these levels. A nested methodological approach, combining spatiotemporal leaps analysis and quantile regression, is employed to appraise county-level carbon pressure dynamics across multiple quantiles in the central-south Liaoning urban agglomeration (CSLUA) from 2002 to 2021. Three principal findings were derived: Firstly, the spatiotemporal distribution of the CPI across CSLUA districts and counties demonstrates regional differentiations conforming to a gradient pattern, with values declining from urban centers toward peripheral areas. Carbon pressure is greater in the west, less in the east, and critically high in the central-western zones. Secondly, the spatial distribution of the CPI indicates clear high-high and low-low agglomeration clusters, suggesting persistent local structures that indicate path dependence and resistance to change in carbon pressure transfer. While the central-western regions exhibit further changes, the eastern areas maintain relative stability. Thirdly, environmental technology factors constrain most districts and counties, while the combined influence of industrial activity and population, along with economic and urbanization pressures, have predominant effects in smaller areas in the central-western region. This highlights the effectiveness of the nested spatiotemporal leaps and quantile regression model in explaining the driving forces underlying the spatiotemporal shifts in CPI. The results suggest that attaining superior regional low-carbon development requires rectifying the asymmetry between carbon sources and sinks, considering the driving forces of diverse transition pathways and their interactions, to finally achieve synergistic optimization that incorporates both shared and unique regional characteristics.",Carbon pressure,Local Indicators of Spatial Association,Spatiotemporal transition,Quantile regression,Urban agglomeration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary objective of this study is to investigate the spatiotemporal variations and underlying mechanisms of the surface urban heat island (SUHI) in Hefei. The study employed the local climate zone (LCZ) method to analyze land surface morphology and spatial structure for 2014 and 2021. Subsequently, calculations were conducted to derive surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), gravity water index (GWI), building surface fraction (BSF), road density (RD), poi density (PD), and population density (PPD). The exploration of the mechanisms by which factors influence SUHI was conducted by utilizing both Pearson correlation analysis and geographic detector models. The results revealed that sparsely built (LCZ 9) and low plants (LCZ D) predominantly characterized built-up and natural coverage areas, respectively. The summer season was distinguished by the most extensive SUHI distribution and the highest SUHII levels. Significantly, SUHII consistently exceeded those of built-up LCZs when contrasted to natural LCZs. Large lowrise (LCZ 8) consistently displayed the highest SUHII levels, whereas water (LCZ G) consistently exhibited the lowest SUHII values. NDBI took precedence and showed a positive correlation with SUHI. Among the socio-economic factors, building height (BH) demonstrated a superior explanatory capability for SUHI compared to other variables. The interaction between NDBI and NDVI maximized the explanation of SUHI under different seasons.

In spatial cognition theory, these differences can be used to support either sequential or continuous theories of spatial knowledge acquisition. To test these hypotheses, we compared spatial learning of participants (N = 67) after navigation in a virtual city with either a forward-up map, a north-up map, or a guiding arrow (i.e., a control) as a navigation aid. Critically, participants were tested on landmark recognition tasks and judgments of relative direction (JRDs) after each of four navigation blocks. We also examined mental workload during map usage using eye tracking in terms of the distributions of fixations on the maps. The results indicated that, regardless of navigation aid, participants improved on both landmark recognition and JRD tasks over blocks of trials. In addition, we found an interaction between block and navigation aid. This interaction suggests that participants in the forward-up map group initially produced more JRD errors than the north-up map group but that the two groups performed similarly in later blocks as they became more familiar with the environment. These findings are consistent with the eye-tracking data, which suggested a decrease in mental workload as evidenced by an increase in fixation distributions over blocks of trials.

Goals: This study aimed to develop an innovative soundscape quality index that concurrently evaluates quietness and naturalness in urban soundscapes. Our objectives included conducting urban soundscape quality mapping, analyzing influential mechanisms, and identifying priority zones for sound environment management. Approaches: We collected sound pressure level (SPL) and raw audio data, from which we computed a normalized difference soundscape index (NDSI). With a dataset comprising 28 explanatory variables encompassing land use, built environment, vegetation characteristics, and temporal factors, we employed the random forest (RF) model to predict 10 indicators, including eight SPL-related indices, NDSI, and the QNS (quietness and naturalness soundscape) index. Crucially, we utilized SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to interpret the RF model. Findings: Spatial variations in quietness and naturalness were evident, closely associated with road networks and vegetation, respectively, with discernible temporal variations. The top three variables influencing QNS were distance to major roads, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and proportion of tree coverage. Moreover, interaction effects highlighted dual negative or synergistic promoting effects on QNS from factors such as road width, human disturbance, vegetation configurations, and land cover. Notably, these mechanisms were successfully applied to six typical tourist attractions in Xiamen city, where five types of management zones were mapped based on priority considerations of population density and soundscape quality.

We found that rural towns with high centrality were mostly located at the convergence of developed megacities. Rural towns with most connections were not necessarily the most central in the inter-town human mobility networks, leading to anomalous values of the centrality. We demonstrated that the anomaly of centrality values emerged due to the community structure of the network. We identified nine communities in the network and found that the geographical borders of communities partly matched the urban administrative borders. However, the results also showed that many rural towns on the fringes of a city were dissolved in their adjacent developed cities, independent of the urban administrative boundary effect.

Here, we employed the percentage of impervious surface area as an indicator of urbanization levels, incorporating the urban heat island (UHI) effect and climates to decipher the multiple effects on the temporal shift in SOS. Our results suggest that urbanization, the UHI effect, and climates jointly drive the phenological timing in cities.

Taking the Jingjinji (JJJ) urban agglomeration from 2011 to 2019 as a research sample, we first evaluated the comprehensive quality of the SERE subsystems at two scale levels using the entropy method. Then, the level of coordinated development among the subsystems was studied by building a coupling coordination degree (CCD)model. Finally, the effect of the four subsystems on the CCD was analyzed by using a panel regression model. The results of the study found that first, the SERE system's comprehensive development quality at the scale of the whole JJJ urban agglomeration showed an upward trend from 2011 to 2019. The resource subsystem always contributed the most, the economic and social subsystem contributed moderately, and the environmental subsystem contributed the least. Secondly, the comprehensive quality of all cities' SERE subsystems showed different degrees of growth, with notable spatial differences. The comprehensive quality levels of social, economic and resource subsystems in Beijing and Tianjin were signifi-cantly higher than those in Hebei. Thirdly, the SERE system's CCD in each city showed various growth ten-dencies. The proportion of severely unbalanced cities decreased from 84.62% to 61.54% during the study period, and regional development became more coordinated. However, there were still obvious spatial differences; Beijing and Tianjin consistently performed better, and the scores of cities in Hebei province were generally low. Fourthly, the degree of coupling coordination among the subsystems was positively correlated with their comprehensive quality. The elasticity of the environmental subsystem was the largest, which was essential to the coordinated development of the SERE system. These findings can offer governments valuable references for adopting appropriate policy measures which promote high-quality, sustainable and coordinated urban development.",Society-Economy-Resource-Environment,system,Coupling coordination degree model,High -quality development,Jingjinji urban agglomeration,Panel regression model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence from Remote Sensing and Land Use Data,SUSTAINABILITY,NOV 2023,6,"Urbanization has led to environmental challenges, with the urban heat island effect being a prominent concern. Understanding the influence of urban environmental characteristics (UECs) on land surface temperature (LST) is essential for addressing this issue and promoting sustainable urban development. The spatiotemporal characteristics and influencing factors of LST have been investigated in past studies, but research that explicitly investigates the key factors and long-term spatial relationships affecting LST in city-scale urban areas is limited. Remote sensing techniques provide valuable insights into LST patterns and the relationship between urban environment and temperature dynamics. We utilized Landsat 8 images to derive the LST and six spectral indices from 2017 to 2022 in Hong Kong, a city characterized by high population density and rapid urban growth. We also acquired land use data to reflect Hong Kong's dynamic urban landscape. The complex interactions between urban environment and LST were analyzed using various analytical techniques, including slope trend analysis, land use change detection, and correlation analysis. Finally, we constructed a random forest model to assess the importance of each environmental characteristic. Our findings provide three key insights for regions experiencing rapid urbanization. First, the LST showed an increasing trend in Hong Kong from 2017 to 2022, with the annual LST rising from 21.13 degrees C to 23.46 degrees C. Second, we identify negative relationships between LST and vegetation (-0.49)/water bodies (-0.49) and a positive correlation between LST and built-up areas (0.56) utilizing Pearson's correlation. Third, the dominant influence of built-up areas was underscored, contributing as much as 53.4% to elevated LST levels, with specific attention to the substantial reclamation activities in Hong Kong. The insights from this study provide valuable guidance for policymakers, urban planners, and environmental researchers to formulate evidence-based strategies to achieve a resilient, livable urban future.",urban climate,urban heat island,land surface temperature,remote sensing index,random forest method,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore asked if insect-feeding bats change in trophic interactions along rural-urban gradients. We predicted that the diet of common noctule bats (Nyctalus noctula) diversifies with increasing levels of urbanisation and that urban bats include more pest and nuisance insect species than rural conspecifics. Using metabarcoding of faecal samples over three years of sampling, we observed a more diverse diet in urban compared with rural noctule bats. Furthermore, urban bats consumed more than twice as many agricultural pests and six times as many nuisance insects as their rural conspecifics. Finally, insect species richness in the diet decreased with increasing levels of sealed surface and vegetation cover at the sampling site. We argue that a highly mobile bat species such as the noctule bat compensate for the lower abundance of insects in urban areas by foraging over relatively large spatial scales, including adjacent rural areas. A high proportion of pest and nuisance insects highlights the importance of urban bats for providing important ecosystem services to humans. Urban planning needs to consider maintaining and establishing dark flight corridors and a diversity of habitats to support urban bat populations.",Metabarcoding,Nyctalus noctula,Ecosystem services,Diet,Urbanisation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have mainly focused on flows pro-duced by speciflc elements in a single urban agglomeration, and they cannot reveal differences in organizational structures affected by multiple elements among different urban agglomerations. Therefore we selected 18 typical urban agglomerations in China and explored their structural characteristics under comprehensive effects of four elements: economy, resources, population and technology, with gravity model and social network analysis. Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Urban Agglomeration had a maximum flow intensity of 5.15, this concentration range was the largest from 0.65 to 3.75, indicating that more elements flowed internally. Shandong Peninsula Urban Agglomeration had the largest network density at 0.412, the lowest efflciency at 0.567, and the lowest hierarchy at 0.000, showing that intercity relationships within SP were the tightest among the18 urban ag-glomerations. Geographical proximity and topological structure of subgroups proved that connections among subgroups were not complex, and cities of different provinces lacked close interactions. Furthermore, most of the key cities with high centrality indexes were municipalities directly under the Central Government or provincial capitals; these cities played important roles in networks and were distributed into ""main spillover"" and ""bidi-rectional spillover"" subgroups. This paper provides a unifled analytical framework aimed at urban agglomera-tions that accounts for flows of multiple types of elements and explores urban organizational structures, and our results could provide scientiflc guidance for promoting the coordinated and sustainable development of urban agglomerations.",Urban agglomeration,Structural characteristics,City flow,Gravity model,Network analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is still room for improvement in identifying spatial scale disparities and coupling linkages in cities, although the standard research paradigm on urban sustainability has produced numerous positive outcomes. To advance urban sustainability research from the perspective of spatial coupling, this study used cluster and cross-tabulation analyses for considering urban sustainable development patterns from the requirements of both development scale and spatial accuracy. Subsequently, the spatial unit coupling relationship between district and street scales was explored. Our findings indicated significant scale dependence in the spatial divergence between the built environment sustainability levels of streets and the economic, social, and environmental sustainability levels of districts. The implication is that significant differences exist in the built environment levels of various sustainable development type districts. The scale effect of the spatial coupling relationship influences urban planning and the transition of sustainable development. Maintaining reasonable population density and maximizing the structure and quality of social public resources supply are priorities for streets with the highest habitat sustainability that are located in low-growth type districts. Priority should be given to population deconcentration for high habitat sustainable streets located in synergistic development type districts to increase the level of public service protection. Supporting facilities should be added to medium sustainable streets in low-growth areas to increase the mix of land use, which should encourage additional production activity concentration, thereby fostering overall economic strength. Further, increasing the accessibility of local public service facilities for low and medium sustainable streets located in ecologically biased areas should be prioritized, but a green and low-carbon orientation should be maintained during building.",sustainable cities,development patterns,spatial coupling,multiscale interaction,spatial structure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of these potential benefits, place attachment, is linked with its own positive outcomes including increased social cohesion, life satisfaction, and environmentally-friendly behaviour. However, it is currently unclear how urban forests relate to place attachment. This case study sought to clarify that relationship. A survey measuring residents' place attachment, satisfaction/dissatisfaction with urban forest services/disservices respectively, perceived urban forest characteristics, and sociodemographic variables was distributed to residents of the Perth Metropolitan Area in Western Australia. The survey measured these variables at three spatial scales: residents' homes, streets, and neighbourhoods. The 638 responses were combined with GIS datasets to calculate objective measures of average canopy cover. SEM was used to test relationships between different groups of variables and understand their relationship with place attachment. We found that place attachment was positively associated with residents' satisfaction with key urban forest services: sense of place, social interactions encouraged by the trees, and fresh air. In turn, place attachment and satisfaction with services were associated with objective canopy cover, both directly and indirectly via perceived characteristics. An analysis of qualitative feedback from residents helped to illustrate nuances around how urban trees relate to sense of place and how the loss of trees can be a source of distress and solastalgia. As such, we recommend that actual and perceived urban forest characteristics, residents' agency, and tree removal be adequately considered in efforts to maximise urban forest benefits.",Perception,Sense of place,Solastalgia,Street trees,Structural equation modelling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, this paper utilized the Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) data from Shanghai, China, to investigate whether there is a spatial trade-off in the health effects of green spaces on people 's inactivity. Our findings confirmed the trade-off effects of green spaces in reducing sedentary time, using interaction terms to highlight how the health impacts of green spaces vary across different population densities and may thus lead to inconsistent relationships between green space and health outcomes. Generally, the ability of green spaces to affect sedentary time decreased as population density increases, particularly regarding park proximity and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Our research also revealed that the trade-off in health benefits from green spaces was influenced by the type of green space. For instance, park proximity, park area, and NDVI showed trade-off effects, with higher population densities enhancing the impact of NDVI on increasing sedentary time ( beta = 133.871), despite NDVI itself decreasing with a rise in population density (r =-0.68). Conversely, the Green Vegetation Index (GVI) did not demonstrate such an effect. The unequal spatial distribution and composition of green space may further exacerbate health inequities. Therefore, this paper recommends that future provisioning of green spaces should take into account the local urban spatial structure.",Health effect,Green space,Trade-off,Sedentariness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With increasing population and urbanization, understanding the drivers influencing soil nematode communities in urban greenspaces is crucial for sustainable urban ecosystem management. We chose the campus of The Ohio State University (OSU) due to its unique urban settings with minimally disturbed both turf and non-turf ecosystems. This study focuses on nematodes, the often-overlooked ecological engineers which play diverse roles in ecosystem functions. Nematodes were collected from 99 sampling locations across three soil depths to represent two ecosystem types (i.e., turf and non-turf) of the OSU campus. Among plant parasitic nematodes (PPN), Helicotylenchus and Pratylenchus populations were above damage threshold limits. No specific pattern of community composition was observed in the spatial variation map. The presence of rare PPN genera in the lower soil layers had a significant impact on beta diversity. Trophic group abundances displayed distinct patterns, with turf ecosystems exhibiting higher PPN as well as total nematode abundance decreasing with soil depths. In the subsurface layer (10-30 cm), both bacterivores and fungivores were higher in the non-turf than turf ecosystem. Fungal-dominated decomposition of organic matter was observed in both ecosystem types. Soil physiochemical properties, specifically, total organic carbon and soil texture, had a significant impact on PPN community composition. However, nematode trophic group composition was more altered by ecosystem type than edaphic factors followed by soil depths. Together these three explanatory variables explained 27.5 % of the total variance in trophic group composition. Overall, this study provides insights into the complex interactions between PPN, trophic groups, soil properties, and urban ecosystem characteristics, contributing valuable knowledge for sustainable urban greenspace management.",Urban ecosystem,Nematodes,PPNs,Community composition,NMDS,Variation partitioning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The urban agglomeration on the Northern Slope of the Tianshan Mountains (UATM) is located in a typical arid region with extremely fragile ecological environment.

This study aimed to explore LUT characteristics of the urban agglomeration on the UATM using a land transfer matrix, information entropy, land utilization intensity, and land utilization dynamic degree. Various ESs indexes were quantitatively measured using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model, and the effect of LUT on ESs was revealed through a geographic detector and spatial auto -correlation analyses. The results of this study led to the following conclusions: First, between 2000 and 2020, the primary land utilization types in UATM were arable land, grassland, and bare land, with significant cross -transformations occurring among these types. Meanwhile, LUT showed marked differences among different regions. LUT changed rapidly and significantly in the central region; in contrast, slower and slight changes were observed in the northern and southern regions. Second, during the research period, habitat maintenance, water yield and carbon sequestration decreased, and the soil retention function increased. The accelerated urban development in the second decade led to more rapid changes in ESs. Finally, both the structure and intensity of land utilization showed the strongest explanatory capability for changes in ESs. Different dimensions of LUT showed significant interactions with ESs. Therefore, it is advisable to guide LUT scientifically, promote vegetation restoration projects, alleviate the impacts of human activities and climate change on ESs, and enhance the ecological safety and environmental sustainability of UATM and even arid regions in Central Asia.",Ecosystem services (ESs),Geographic detector,Land utilization transformation (LUT),InVEST model,Spatial auto -correlation analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So far, settlement patterns have mostly been considered as passive imprints of past human activities and most theories are limited to ecological processes. Locational and spatial interactions have scarcely been included as long-term driving forces of settlement systems but hold promise to explain large-scale patterns. This paper proposes a conceptual model for long-term spatial adaptive settlement systems based on the complex adaptive systems framework and both spatial and cross -scale interactions. The goal of the model is to find new ways of interpreting archaeological location data and understand settlement systems as emerging from microchoices of population units interacting in space. The conceptualisation is carried out on a level that it can be used to bridge hunter -gatherer and urban theories. We first describe settlement patterns based on concepts from archaeological locational studies and socialecological systems. Second, we identify the abstract spatial and aspatial entities of the system and describe the potential relations between them. Using knowledge from previous research, we then map both empirically observable and abstract system entities and predict links between them in order to come up with an overarching conceptual framework. The system is based on residential choice mechanisms and exposes several crossscale feedback loops between the micro -level choices and the settlement system emerging at the meso-level. We finally argue that the proposed adaptive settlement system framework has the potential to bring new insights into long-term processes, especially through dynamic spatial simulation, and at the same time, provides an interpretational framework for archaeological records and empirical spatial analysis.

Results reveal that the high-density built-up area(HDA) exhibits spatial patterns of higher temperatures, poorer ventilation, more arid, and more severe heat stress than near-river and low-density areas. Moreover, HDA tends to convert more radiation energy into ground heat storage(QS) Q S ) and sensible heat flux(QH) Q H ) during daytime, and QS S is subsequently released into QH H at night, thus deteriorating the nighttime thermal environment. Whereas, the river converts more radiation energy into Q S , with a portion transformed into latent heat flux, which benefits summer cooling.

To further improve the characterisation and modelling of UPF, this study advances a citizen science approach that integrates local knowledge with the understanding and interpretation of UPF. The proposed framework provides an avenue to couple quantitative and qualitative community-based observations with traditional sources of hydro-information. This approach allows researchers and practitioners to fill spatial and temporal data gaps in urban catchments and hydrologic/hydrodynamic models, thus yielding a more accurate characterisation of local catchment response and improving rainfall-runoff modelling of UPF. The results of applying this framework indicate how community-based practices provide a bi-directional learning context between experts and residents, which can contribute to resilience building by providing UPF knowledge necessary for risk reduction and response to extreme flooding events.",Urban pluvial flooding,citizen science,flood modelling,participatory mapping,catchment characterisation,Tennessee,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, current research often analyzes each regulating factor as an independent variable when examining its relationship with land surface temperature (LST), with limited studies considering the combined contribution weights of all regulating factors. Based on multi-source remote sensing data and ground observations from the near summers of 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2018 in the built-up area of Xuzhou City, numerical values and spatial distributions of 15 regulating factors, including ISA density (fi), land surface albedo (Albedo), population density (Population), anthropogenic heat flux (AHF), maximum ISA patch index (LPIISA), natural connectivity of ISA patches (COHESIONISA), aggregation index of ISA patches (AIISA), average shape index of ISA patches (SHAPE_MNISA), UGS density (fv), evapotranspiration (ET), UGS shading index (UGSSI), maximum UGS patch index (LPIUGS), natural connectivity of UGS patches (COHESIONUGS), aggregation index of UGS patches (AIUGS), and average shape index of UGS patches (SHAPE_MNUGS), were separately extracted within the study area. Using geographically weighted regression models and bivariate spatial autocorrelation models, we separately obtained the quantitative and spatial correlations between the 15 regulating factors and LST. The results revealed that all selected regulating factors exhibited high goodness-of-fit and significant spatial correlations with LST, which led to their categorization into eight warming factors and seven cooling factors. The factor detection of the Geographic Detector further reveals the combined contribution of all regulating factors to LST. The results indicate that cooling factors collectively have higher explanatory power for LST compared to warming factors, with UGSSI contributing the most to LST, while Population contributed the least. Furthermore, the interaction detection results of the Geographic Detector have highlighted variations in the explanatory power of different factor combinations on LST. Ultimately, it has identified factor combinations that have proven to be most effective in mitigating the urban heat environment across three scenarios: warming factors alone, cooling factors alone, and a combination of both warming and cooling factors. The suggested factor combinations are as follows: fi boolean AND Albedo, fi boolean AND LPIISA, UGSSI boolean AND fv, UGSSI boolean AND LPIUGS, fi boolean AND UGSSI, and Albedo boolean AND UGSSI. Therefore, our findings hold the potential to provide a valuable reference for urban planning and climate governance. Tailoring factor combinations to the local context and selecting the most effective ones can enable cost-effective mitigation of the urban heat environment.",urban thermal environment,impervious surface,green space,landscape pattern,Landsat 8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interestingly, the urban-rural distinction of the impacts received scant attention in the literature. Moreover, the combined effect of these elements are less studied than their standalone effects.Objective: This study explores the combined effectiveness of built environment-based safety measures in urban and rural settings. Data and method: The study uses nine years (2011-2019) of non-motorist (pedestrian and bicyclist) crash data in Florida. It classifies urban and rural areas with the multivariate clustering method and models the crash count with Log-transformed Spatial Error Models.Results: Findings suggest that urban areas, tracts with low median income, a lower percentage of senior citizens, and a higher percentage of black, white, and Hispanic people are significantly associated with a high number of nonmotorist crashes. The percentage of pedestrian and bicyclist commuters is positively associated with pedestrian and bicycle crash count, respectively. Among BE variables, more crashes are observed in tracts with more commercial land use (LU), less recreational LU, higher LU mix, more traffic, signalized intersection, transit stops, and sidewalks. Having more traffic and fewer transit stops pose lesser risk in urban areas than rural areas. The combined effects suggest that increasing commercial LU where LU entropy is high (or vice-versa) will help to reduce nonmotorist crashes. Also, in high entropy areas, increasing rural traffic is riskier whereas increasing urban traffic is safer.Conclusion: This paper documents the need of considering urban-rural differences and interaction effects among BE elements for nonmotorist safety.",Pedestrian crash,Bicycle crash,Built environment,Safety,Spatial error model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the highest form of spatial organization at the mature stage of urbanization, an urban agglomeration (UA) can be a key area for studying this urban-ecology interaction. This study integrated the urbanization evaluation, ecosystem services value (ESV) assessment, and optimized coupling coordination degree (CCD) models to explore the coupling coordination of urbanization and ESV at the UA scale. Analyzing data from the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei UA (BTHUA) from 1985 to 2020 revealed that: (1) urbanization continues to increase and ESV fluctuates; however, both exhibit significant spatial heterogeneity. (2) The CCD is increasing annually but remains relatively low overall; spatially, it is high in the northeast and low in the southwest. (3) The main driving factors of the CCD are urbanization rate and slope, while all five selected factors have a positive effect. (4) Government decision-making can guide the CCD.

Although numerous endeavors have been devoted to this field, the insufficient topological representation for passenger flows in the URT network, the overlooking of intrinsic correlations among multi-source data, and the information loss in deep-learning frameworks are still critical issues that need to be addressed. This study proposes a multi-stage fusion passenger forecasting (MSFPF) model to accomplish short-term multi-step passenger forecasting leveraging multi-source data, and overcome the above-mentioned challenges. Based on the characteristics of passenger flows in the URT network, time-based origin-destination flow data is involved and utilized to enhance the representation of flows and provide spatial-temporal features. Then, the interaction and relationship among multi-source data are estimated to capture their intrinsic correlations. To effectively and comprehensively extract temporal and spatial features, a transformer long short-term memory block and a depth-wise attention block are constructed with attention mechanisms and employed. Furthermore, we construct the multi-stage fusion (MSF) structure to alleviate the information loss during the learning process, which is a significant component in improving the forecasting accuracy. In addition, the model is applied to two large-scale real-world datasets, in which it outperforms nine widely used baselines and four specific variants of itself. The quantitative experiments demonstrate the robustness and superiority of the proposed MSFPF model, and the significant contribution of the MSF structure in the model.",urban rail transit system,deep learning and advanced computing applications,short-term forecasting,spatial-temporal data mining,multi-source data fusion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this aspect remains largely unexplored in current research due to a lack of innovative methodological approaches that effectively capture the complementarities, potentialities, and contestations inherent in the dynamics of peri-urban areas. We contend that peri-urbanisation needs to be reconceptualized as an alternative socio-spatial framework that extends the predominantly Eurocentric discourse on counterurbanisation, making it more inclusive of the emerging urban-rural transformations in the global South.

Investigating the individual contributions and interactions of factors affecting variations in Hg concentrations, particularly under climate change, is crucial for safeguarding watershed ecosystems and human health. We collected 381 water samples from China's Weihe River Basin (WRB) during dry and wet seasons to assess the total Hg (THg) concentration. Results revealed high Hg concentrations in the WRB (0.1-2200.9 ng/L, mean 126.2 +/- 335.5 ng/L), with higher levels during the wet season (wet season: 249.1 +/- 453.5 ng/L, dry season: 12.7 +/- 14.0 ng/L), particularly in the mainstream and southern tributaries of the Weihe River. Industrial pollution (contributing 26.2 %) and precipitation (contributing 33.5 %) drove spatial heterogeneity in THg concentrations during the dry and wet seasons, respectively. Notably, combined explanatory power increased to 47.9 % when interaction was considered, highlighting the amplifying effect of climate change, particularly precipitation, on the impact of industrial pollution. The middle and downstream of the Weihe River, especially the Guanzhong urban agglomeration, were identified as high-risk regions for Hg pollution.

This study conducted research on land use conflict and zoning control with a view to contributing new ideas for the prevention and resolution of land use risks. By analyzing the positioning and drawing upon fundamental theories, a novel research paradigm was proposed. An empirical study was conducted in the Gan River Basin in Jiangxi Province by applying the comprehensive evaluation method and geographical detector, and the basin was divided into six types of zones according to the intensity of land use conflict and the hierarchy of ecosystem service values. The results of the empirical study showed that the areas of intense conflict, low conflict and weak conflict accounted for 1.57%, 29.16% and 69.26% of the basin area, respectively. Of the intense conflict areas, 4.42% of the areas in the lower Gan River Basin were in intense conflict, while only 0.37% of the right bank of the middle reaches was in intense conflict. The driving factor analysis showed that precipitation, the population density and policy planning had a greater influence on land use conflict and that land use conflict was more likely to occur with the interaction of precipitation and the nighttime light index, population density and NDVI. The superimposed image analysis revealed that the land use conflict was intense at the junctions of urban areas and cropland and at the junctions of cropland and forests in the middle and upper reaches of the basin, which were mainly caused by the demand for urban expansion and the spread of agricultural production areas. The results of this empirical study are in agreement with the actual situation in the Gan River Basin, proving that the research paradigm proposed in this study is scientific and applicable. Moreover, we emphasize that this paradigm can be adapted in its application according to different research objects and continuously improved in response to the evolution of the territorial spatial management system.

This research took the diversification process of grid blocks as an angle to understand the transformation process of Beijing's urban morphology. It took 194 grid blocks within the 3rd Ring Road of Beijing as research objects. First, the paper proposed a whole view of Beijing's grid blocks by 1) visualizing their construction process, 2) classifying 5 morphological clusters by 7 indicators (Block size, Block shape regularity, Intensity, Coverage, Network density, Plot shape regularity, Standard deviation of plot size), and 3) investigating their distribution. Second, the diversification process of grid blocks was clarified from two layers: the block-boundary layer and the inner-space layer. Finally, the mechanism of block form diversification was clarified by exploring the connections between elements in each layer, and the influence of urban development on block form transformation. The study re-defined the diversification process in a more quantitative way from both time and spatial dimension. It concluded that the diversification is influenced by changes in urban planning principles and locations, and emerged thorough the long-term transformation and resubdivision. The interaction between the boundary and the inner space stimulates the diversification. And based on these, it concluded with a discussion of limitations and potentials on grid blocks' construction and renovation. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

In this study, cities in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River (URYR) were adopted as the research object, a theoretical analysis framework for the urban land use efficiency (ULUE) and ecological environment quality (EEQ) was established, the ULUE was measured by using the Slacks-Based Measure (SBM) model, the coupling coordination and interactive corresponding response relationship between the ULUE and EEQ were analyzed, and the influencing factors of the coupling coordination between these two systems were explored by using the random forest model. The following conclusions can be obtained: in 2020, compared with those in 2006, both the ULUE and EEQ were improved, and the two systems exhibited interactions and significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity. The coupling coordination degree (CCD) between the ULUE and EEQ could facilitate maintaining the original state, and the transfer of the CCD exhibited a significant spatial correlation with the state of neighbouring cities. The effect of the ULUE on the EEQ indicated nonlinear characteristics, while the effect of the EEQ on the ULUE was manifested as inhibition initially and then promotion.

However, urbanization has significantly affected regional vegetation phenology and can potentially weaken the cooling potential of vegetation. Previous studies have mainly focused on national and regional vegetation phenology, but local-scale vegetation phenology and dynamic variations in built-up areas remain unclear. Therefore, this study characterized the vegetation phenology in the densely built-up area of Beijing, China over the period of 2000-2020 based on high-resolution NDVI data using Savitzky-Golay filtering and explored its spatiotemporal characteristics and drivers. The results indicate that the vegetation phenology exhibits significant spatial heterogeneity and clustering characteristics. Compared with vegetation in peripheral blocks, vegetation in central urban blocks generally has an earlier start in the growing season (SOS), later end in the growing season (EOS), and a longer growing season length (GSL). However, the overall distribution of these parameters has experienced a process of decentralization along with urbanization. In terms of drivers, vegetation phenology indicators are mainly influenced by background climate. Specifically, SOS and GSL are mainly affected by temperature (TEP), whereas EOS is mainly influenced by annual precipitation (PRE). Additionally, local environmental factors, particularly the percentage of water body (WAP), also have an impact. Notably, the local environment and background climate have a synergistic effect on vegetation phenology, which is greater than their individual effects.

Among the pollutants found in groundwater, of special interest are contaminants of emerging concern (CEC), as they pose a high risk to the aquatic environment and human health. The behaviour, spatial distribution and processes that control them in the aquatic environment are still uncertain and most of them are unregulated. In this paper we study the inputs and processes controlling the hydrochemistry of Barcelona urban groundwater with special emphasis on the CEC. We selected 29 CEC that were detected at high concentrations of up to 1 mu g L-1 (e.g. gemfibrozil, benzotriazole, among others). Towards the higher zones we identify groundwater with relative low mineralization more proximate to the natural recharge composition, while towards the urban area the anthropic inputs are evident (e.g. nitrate concentrations range from 50 to 200 mg L-1).

Assessing regional drought resilience and efficiency is beneficial for governments to allocate disaster relief funds effectively and assist regions in enhancing their disaster resilience capabilities. In this study, we construct a ""social-economic-environmental-institutional"" drought resilience assessment framework to reveal the temporal and spatial evolution mechanism and spatial autocorrelation of drought resilience, explore the main factors influencing the evolution of this spatial pattern and the strength and interaction mechanisms among such influencing factors. And build a model from the perspective of input and output, use the SBM-DEA model to evaluate the efficiency of drought resistance, and reveal the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of drought resistance in different regions. The results show that China's drought resilience over the past 10 years has increased by an average index value of 13.14%, showing an overall increasing trend. The drought resilience level of coastal provinces in eastern China is relatively higher, while the resilience level in the inland northwest region is relatively lower. China's drought resilience has significant positive spatial correlation, the development of resilience is in a relatively stable spatial pattern. The H-H aggregation area is distributed in the southeastern coastal area, while the L-L aggregation area is distributed in western China, and the east-west difference is significant. Environmental indicators, such as annual average rainfall and annual average temperature, are the main factors causing spatial differentiation in drought resilience in the China, and the interaction between influencing factors is greater than the impact of a single factor. The drought resilience efficiency of provinces in the inland northwest and southeastern coastal areas is relatively high, while that of provinces in the southwest and northeast is relatively low. China's drought resilience efficiency still needs to be improved.

These anthropogenic impacts on wildlife arise from multiple bottom-up and top-down pathways, including habitat loss, resource provisioning, climate change, pollution, infrastructure development, hunting and our direct presence. Animal behaviour is an important mechanism linking these disturbances to population outcomes, although these behavioural pathways are often complex and can remain obscured when different aspects of behaviour are studied in isolation from one another. The spatial-social interface provides a lens for understanding how an animal's spatial and social environments interact to determine its spatial and social phenotype (i.e. measurable characteristics of an individual), and how these phenotypes interact and feed back to reshape environments. Here, we review studies of animal behaviour at the spatial-social interface to understand and predict how human disturbance affects animal movement, distribution and intraspecific interactions, with consequences for the conservation of populations and ecosystems. By understanding the spatial-social mechanisms linking human disturbance to conservation outcomes, we can better design management interventions to mitigate undesired consequences of disturbance.This article is part of the theme issue 'The spatial-social interface: a theoretical and empirical integration'.",anthropocene,human-wildlife conflict,landscape of fear,movement ecology,spatial-social interface,wildlife management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ritual-hosting spaces encompass a range of environments that must possess specific physical, cultural, social, economic, and managerial attributes. Urban regeneration through ritual functionalities can challenge the conditions of spaces, facilitating the formation of social space, fostering solidarity, enhancing the sense of place, and increasing citizen participation. Zanjan city is renowned for its ritual functions, especially during the religious and national ceremonies in the month of Muharram. Therefore, it is expected that the spaces manifesting these religious ceremonies align with their ritual functions and that the deterioration, decay, and decline of these ritual axes would significantly impact the quantity and quality of solidarity, sense of belonging, identity, and more. Research objective: This study aims to identify the role of ritual-centric axes as drivers of regeneration Research method: The study employs explanatory methods based on novel future study techniques. The factors were evaluated by 30 urban planning experts using environmental scanning and cross-impact/structural analysis. The specialized future studies' software, MICMAC, was used to identify the functionality of the ritual axis as a driver for urban regeneration. Conclusion: The results indicate that the dispersion of the influential variables suggests system instability. Out of 29 factors analyzed, 10 key factors were identified as critical influencers on the ritual-centric axis, consistently appearing in both direct and indirect methods. These key factors-alignment with historical context, sense of place, dynamism and sustainability, physical continuity, mental role creation, environmental signification, organization derived from religion and culture, physical-social continuity, significantly improve the quality of interactions and solidarity among individuals with the environment.",Urban Regeneration,Driver,Ritual-Centric Functionality,Culture-Based,Zanjan City.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pandemic restrictions globally forced social distancing, limited travel, and curtailed visits to UGBS. While some studies have linked public health to UGBS use during COVID-19, few have comprehensively examined the interplay between visiting patterns, demographics, unhealthy habits, mental and physical health, and willingness to pay (WTP). This gap is particularly evident in NW China, where UGBS are scarce but urban areas are densely populated. Therefore, understanding the relationship between UGBS utilization and public health during the pandemic is crucial. This representative study in Lanzhou, the core city of NW China, aimed to elucidate public engagement with UGBS during the pandemic and its effects on health and well-being, providing a comprehensive analysis of these multifaceted interactions. The findings reveal that proximity, transportation modes, and urban infrastructure significantly influence UGBS utilization. Frequent and prolonged engagement with UGBS enhances perceived mental and physical health benefits, driving higher WTP among younger adults, educated individuals, married people, and long-term residents. Conversely, longer travel times decrease WTP, underscoring the need for accessible UGBS. Notably, smokers and drinkers also report greater benefits from UGBS, likely due to their appreciation of restorative effects. To maximize UGBS utilization and support, urban planners should enhance accessibility by strategically locating UGBS within walking distance of residential areas and improving public transportation links. Promoting regular use through community activities and extended operating hours can encourage more frequent and longer visits. Targeted educational campaigns for older and less-educated demographics can raise awareness of UGBS benefits. Incorporating health-promoting features such as walking trails and quiet areas can further enhance the physical and mental health benefits of UGBS. Community involvement in planning and maintenance is crucial to ensure these spaces meet local needs. Implementing supportive policies that maintain accessibility and appeal for all economic segments will make UGBS inclusive and sustainable, fostering healthier, more resilient urban communities. This study empirically demonstrates the crucial role of UGBS for residents during crises, offering insights that can guide urban spatial policies and green space management in other cities.",Urban green-blue space,Human well-being,Public health,Pandemic,NW China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Influenced by the development of social economy and the internet, physical bookstores also have become a combination of cultural space and tourism experience. In this case, it is necessary to explore the spatial characteristics and influencing factors of physical bookstores. This study uses Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), spatial analysis and geographical detectors to calculate the spatial distribution pattern and factors influencing physical bookstores in national central cities/municipality (hereafter using cities) in western China. Based on spatial data, population density, road density and other data, this study constructed a data set of the influencing factors of physical bookstores, consisting of 11 factors along 6 dimensions for 3 national central cities in western China. The results are as follows: first, the spatial distribution pattern of physical bookstores in Xi'an, Chengdu, and Chongqing is unbalanced. The spatial distribution of physical bookstores in Xi'an and Chongqing is from southwest to northeast and are relatively clustered, while those in Chengdu are relatively discrete. Second, the spatial distribution pattern of physical bookstores has been formed under the influence of different factors. The intensity and significance of influencing factors differ in the case cities. However, in general, the social factor, business factor, the density of research facilities, tourism factor and road density are the main driving factors in the three cities. There is a synergistic relationship between public libraries and physical bookstores. Third, the explanatory power becomes stronger after the interaction between various factors. In Xi'an and Chengdu, the density of communities and the density of research facilities have stronger explanatory power for the dependent variable after interacting with other factors.

However, understanding the complex and diverse spatial drivers of SHM and their interactive effects remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis framework that integrates Geodetector, CatBoost, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) techniques to identify and elucidate the interactive effects of spatial drivers in SHM within the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of China. Our investigation incorporated fourteen environmental factors and focused on the pollution levels of three prominent heavy metals: Hg, Cd, and Zn. These findings provide several key insights: (1) The distribution of SHM is influenced by the combined effects of various individual factors and interactions within the source -flow -sink process. (2) Compared with the spatial interpretation of individual factors, the interaction between Hg and Cd exhibited enhanced spatial explanatory power. Similarly, interactions involving Zn mainly demonstrated increased spatial explanatory power, but there was one exception in which a weakening was observed. (3) Spatial heterogeneity plays a crucial role in determining the contributions of environmental factors to soil heavy metal concentrations. Although individual factors generally promote metal accumulation, their effects fluctuate when interactions are considered. (4) The SHAP interpretable method effectively addresses the limitations associated with machine -learning models by providing understandable insights into heavy metal pollution. This enables a comparison of the importance of environmental factors and elucidates their directional impacts, thereby aiding in the understanding of interaction mechanisms.

Number of visitors to green areas, initially declined due to imposed restrictions, was restored after they were lifted as established by several studies across the globe However, little is still known about changes in behavior and preferences of park visitors in the post-COVID time. In this study, we investigated spatial-temporal patterns of recreational activities in the three urban parks in Moscow (Russia) prior, during and after the COVID-19 lockdown (in 2019 and 2020). The selected parks represent two different types: a centrally located park with much infrastructure and open landscapes (Gorky Park) and parks located at the outskirts of the city center with a more forested landscape and little infrastructure (Timiryazevski and Sokolniki parks). Recreational activities were identified based on the analysis of social media photos using machine-learning algorithms. As expected, park closures during lockdown resulted in overall decrease in the number of taken photos. After the parks were re-opened, however, the number of photos did not grow immediately. The number of photos only restored after almost three months, and the visiting peak shifted to autumn. Differences between parks were related to the type of the park and its landscape structure. The lowest decrease in the number of photos was observed for the Timiryazevsky park - a semi-natural green area, while the centrally located Gorky Park was the most affected, likely due to the strictest control measures. In comparison to 2019, photos in 2020 were more evenly distributed across the area in all the three parks. Besides, 'natural' areas became the main attractors for the visitors - photos under 'nature observation' category became the most popular. Spatial distribution of the recreational activities in post-lockdown period was characterized by larger distances between photos, likely corresponding to the social distancing. COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the value of green areas for citizens, but also changed their recreational preferences and overall behavior in parks. The observed shift from high density of visitors around entertainments and attractions in 2019 to a more homogeneous and less dense distribution along the natural zones in 2020 reveals a new pattern in visitors behavior and preference, which shall be considered in spatial planning of the parks.

In this paper, we present a grounded design study aimed at developing a technology prototype for an automated urban heritage risk monitoring tool. Originally conceived as a techno-fix to the inefficiency of administrative practice, the prototype development reveals tensions and stumbling blocks within digitalisation efforts. Using the analytical lens of the Trifecta model of ITbased regulation, the case study examines the interaction between technological and administrative domains in shaping technology design choices. Based on this case study, we critique the notion that IT is perceived as capable of providing ""techno-fix"" solutions to tasks requiring reflective human decision-making, especially when such solutions are expected to be effective without first redesigning the entire organisational system. The paper concludes with a discussion on the limits of automating administrative practices and identifies specific avenues for further research into the digitalisation of urban heritage preservation.",Urban heritage preservation (UHP),Risk monitoring,Digitalisation,Automation,Trifecta model of IT-based regulation,Weakly structured systems (WSS),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As PM2.5 and NO2 are the main air pollutants, it is of great significance to explore the spatial causes of their pollution and their interaction mechanism. This study used machine learning (LightGBM) and hot spot analysis to map the spatial distribution of PM2.5 and NO2 in Southwest Fujian (SWFJ) in 2018 and their key pollution areas. Then, the factors and interactive detection of geographical detectors were used to conduct a detailed analysis of the quantitative impact of potential factors such as human activities, terrain, air pollutants, and meteorology on PM2.5 and NO2 pollution. From this we can learn that 1. LightGBM has good stability for drawing the spatial distribution of PM2.5 and NO2. 2. The spatial mechanism of PM2.5 and NO2 can be effectively interpreted from a massive data and macro perspective. 3. A large amount of evidence shows that potential factors such as human activities, topography, air pollutants and meteorology have direct or indirect effects on PM2.5 and NO2 pollution in the SWFJ area. This includes the direct impact of local road traffic emissions on the distribution of PM2.5 and NO2 pollution, the digestion of both by vegetation, the mutual transformation of atmospheric pollutants themselves, and the impact of meteorological conditions. This study not only confirms the effectiveness of machine learning combined with geographical detectors to promote the study of regional air pollution mechanisms, but also confirms the feasibility of exploring the spatial distribution mechanisms of various air pollutants. Therefore, this study is of great significance for explaining the spatial distribution of PM2.5 and NO2, and can also provide reference for policy formulation to reduce regional PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations.",LightGBM,PM2.5 and NO2 spatial distribution,Hot spotanalysis,Geodeteotor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data-driven models are utilized to forecast waterlogging areas by establishing intricate relationships between explanatory variables and waterlogging states. This approach tackles the constraints of mechanistic models, which are frequently complex and unable to incorporate socio-economic factors. Previous research predominantly employed single-type data-driven models to predict waterlogging locations and evaluation of their effectiveness. There is a scarcity of comprehensive performance comparisons and uncertainty analyses of different types of models, as well as a lack of interpretability analysis. The chosen study area was the central area of Beijing, which is prone to waterlogging. Given the high manpower, time, and economic costs associated with collecting waterlogging information, the waterlogging point distribution map released by the Beijing Water Affairs Bureau was selected as labeled samples. Twelve factors affecting waterlogging susceptibility were chosen as explanatory variables to construct Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function (SVM-RBF), Particle Swarm Optimization-Weakly Labeled Support Vector Machine (PSO-WELLSVM), and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt). The utilization of diverse single evaluation indicators (such as F-score, Kappa, AUC, etc.) to assess the model performance may yield conflicting results. The Distance between Indices of Simulation and Observation (DISO) was chosen as a comprehensive measure to assess the model's performance in predicting waterlogging points. PSO-WELLSVM exhibited the highest performance with a DISOtest value of 0.63, outperforming MaxEnt (0.78), which excelled in identifying areas highly susceptible to waterlogging, including extremely high susceptibility zones. The SVM-RBF and RF models demonstrated suboptimal performance and exhibited overfitting. The examination of waterlogging susceptibility distribution maps predicted by the four models revealed significant spatial differences due to variations in computational principles and input parameter complexities. The integration of four WSAMs based on logistic regression has been shown to significantly decrease the uncertainty of a single data-driven model and identify the most flood-prone areas. To improve the interpretability of the data model, a geographical detector was incorporated to demonstrate the explanatory capacity of 12 variables and the process of waterlogging. Building Density (BD) exhibits the highest explanatory power in relation to explain waterlogging susceptibility (Q value = 0.202), followed by Distance to Road, Frequency of Heavy Rainstorms (FHR), DEM, etc. The interaction between BD and FHR results in a nonlinear increase in the explanatory power of waterlogging susceptibility. The presence of waterlogging susceptibility risk in the research area can be attributed to the interactions of multiple factors.",Urban waterlogging susceptibility,Machine learning,MaxEnt,DISO,Uncertainty analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, current research primarily focuses on quantifying the risk of urban heat based on LST, Ta, etc., overlooking the crucial and intimate influence of continuous intense solar radiation on human thermal comfort and health. Simultaneously, there is a lack of smaller units to support more precise planning. This study utilized the radiant heat stress intensity (RHSI) metric concentrating on the intensity and duration of thermal radiation, to develop a thermal-radiation induced health risk (TIHR) assessment system. Leveraging technologies such as the SOLWEIG model, Python, BERT, and GIS enables precise calculations of 12 spatial indices, including RHSI and Weibo heat. This facilitates a more accurate assessment of health risks at the smallest urban units (blocks) and directly guides planning. The application of this workflow in the case of Suoyuwan, Dalian, China, confirms its value, as it can be used to determine which blocks should be prioritized for specific aspects of risk prevention and control. The results show that some blocks exhibited differences in TIHR even within close proximity, with disaster-causing factors varying according to locations.

However, due to the significant correlation between the influence of pollution sources on cancer and the distance between them, and the influence of pollution sources by weather, emission concentration, and other factors is different, there are still some challenges in spatial ordered-pair pattern mining. In this paper, we design an online system MIPC-SHOPs for mining the influence of industrial pollution on cancer based on spatial high-influence ordered-pair patterns. Unlike previous works, first, a new influence measure based on Gaussian kernel density estimation is proposed in MIPC-SHOPs, which solves the problem that the influence of pollution sources on cancer cases decays with distance. Second, to restore the diffusion influence of pollution sources in the real world as much as possible, the urban wind direction, wind speed, and pollution emission concentration were considered to set a new spatial neighbor relationship measurement criterion. Considering the different carcinogenic levels of the pollution sources, a weighted method is proposed to calculate the influence of pollutant on cancer.

Ganzi Prefecture has a complicated topography and vulnerable ecosystems. Geological disasters have historically been the most serious risks in the region. To fully understand the potential risks and strengthen resilience, the study investigates the resilience level of 18 counties in Ganzi. Firstly, the paper develops a multidimensional index system based on the Baseline Resilience Indicators for Communities (BRIC) framework. And the entropy weighting method is used to calculate Ganzi's disaster resilience level from the aspects of ""society-economy-infrastructure-environment."" Then, the study uses exploratory spatial data (ESDA) to analyze the spatial-temporal evolution of disaster resilience. Finally, Geodetector is used to investigate the main driving factors of disaster resilience and their interactions. The results indicated that Ganzi's disaster resilience had maintained an upward trend from 2011 to 2019, with significant spatial divergence, which shows high resilience in the southeast and low resilience in the northwest. The economic indicator is the driving factor in the spatial difference of disaster resilience, and the interaction factor has a significantly stronger explanatory power for resilience.

Groundwater pathways play an important role in the year-round delivery of Cl to streams, but quantifying this pathway, including spatiotemporal variability and amount of Cl mass stored in the subsurface, is challenging. The objective of this study was to demonstrate, evaluate, and compare the potential applications of the geoelectrical techniques - electromagnetics (EM) and direct current (DC) resistivity - for mapping salt contamination in shallow urban groundwater and characterizing the groundwater pathways delivering Cl to urban streams. EM and DC surveys were conducted (3D mapping and 2D time-lapse) across a 20 m salt-impacted stream section and surrounding riparian zone that is located near an arterial road and parking lot. Groundwater samples and soil cores were also collected to validate the geoelectrical results. Both the EM and DC surveys detected high salt concentrations in the shallow subsurface (up to 3 m depth) near the road, parking lot, and stream; however, DC more accurately represented groundwater Cl concentrations. DC results were used to calculate the total Cl mass in the subsurface, with the spatial mass distribution used to infer the temporal variability in the subsurface salt plume. Finally, time-lapse DC showed that the highest groundwater salt concentrations existed near the stream between June and October - this is expected to contribute to the elevated salt concentrations in the stream during summer months. This study has shown that EM and DC can be useful for identifying groundwater salt concentration, storage, and transport in a non-intrusive and efficient manner, making them valuable field tools for characterizing and quantifying groundwater salt pathways to urban streams.",Direct current resistivity,Electromagnetics,Urban environment,Hydrogeophysics,Groundwater-surface water interactions,Road de-icing salt,Groundwater contaminant plume,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As urbanization and industrialization increase, the two components affect the natural environment of the urban areas. The present study investigated the daytime and nighttime spatiotemporal distribution of air pollutants and examined their relationship with LST for Bengaluru and Hyderabad cities of India. Daytime/nighttime/seasonal/spatial variations of air pollutants and LST, sensitivity of air pollutant in affecting LST, relationship between air pollutants and LST, and hotspots/coldspots analysis for LST and air pollutants was carried out. The study utilized, air pollutants data of 5-years from air quality monitoring stations and LST data of overlapping period from MODIS satellite. PM 2.5 exceeded the national and international air quality standards while all other parameters were within specified limits/guideline values, at both the cities. The study found that LST had maximum sensitivity towards PM 2.5 and NO 2 for both the cities indicating that both these parameters are more effective in causing changes in the LST values. High Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI) values for urban areas demonstrated strong surface urban heat island (SUHI) during nighttime in both the cities. Pearson's correlation analysis showed that LST, at Hyderabad, was positively correlated with PM 2.5 (r = 0.714) during daytime. Relationship of LST with all air pollutants and meteorological parameters was investigated simultaneously and very strong relationship of LST with all other parameters was observed for both daytime and nighttime for both the cities. The R 2 values at Bengaluru were 0.98 and 0.92 for nighttime and daytime, respectively, while the corresponding values were 0.87 and 0.93, respectively for Hyderabad. Hotspot analysis showed that total area of hotspots/coldspots undergoes temporal variations and the corresponding area during daytime was higher/lower compared to nighttime for different parameters. The trend of increase/decrease of daytime area of hotspots/ coldspots, over nighttime area, was also different from different parameters as well as it was observed different for both the cities. Overall, the present study provides holistic insights into the interaction between air pollutants and LST in urban contexts.

Assessing ES bundles (ESBs) is critical to understanding the spatial allocation and interactions between multiple ESs. However, dynamic projections of ESBs under various future scenarios are still lacking, and their underlying driving mechanisms have received insufficient attention. This study examined the Beijing -Tianjin -Hebei urban agglomeration and proposed a framework that integrates patch -generating land use simulation into three shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios and clustering analysis to assess spatiotemporal variations in seven ESs and ESBs from 1990 to 2050. The spatial trajectories of ESBs were analyzed to identify fluctuating regions susceptible to SSP scenarios. The results indicated that (1) different scenarios exhibited different loss rates of regulating and supporting services, where the mitigation of degradation was most significant under SSP126. The comprehensive ES value was highest under SSP245. (2) Bundles 1 and 2 (dominated by regulating and supporting services) had the largest total proportion under SSP126 (51.92 %). The largest total proportion of Bundles 4 and 5 occurred under SSP585 (48.96 %), with the highest provisioning services. The SSP126 scenario was projected to have the least ESB fluctuation at the grid scale, while the most occurred under SSP585. (3) Notably, synergies between regulating/supporting services were weaker under SSP126 than under either SSP245 or SSP585, while trade-offs between water yield and non provisioning services were strongest. (4) Forestland and grassland proportions significantly affected carbon sequestration and habitat quality. Climatic factors (precipitation and temperature) acted as the dominant drivers of provisioning services, particularly water yield.

Currently, there is still a lack of practical and simple assessment approaches for predicting this influence. In this paper, a new analytical method is developed that uses a continuous Euler-Bernoulli beam to simulate shield tunnel behavior due to overlying basement excavation. Firstly, the excavation-induced greenfield displacement at the tunnel axis is obtained with the application of Mindlin's solution. Secondly, the longitudinal response of the tunnel due to the ground movement induced by excavation is computed using a finite difference method. The effectiveness and applica-bility of the proposed method are validated by three high-quality case histories, including field measurement, FEM method, and semi-analytical method. Different from previous studies, the tunnel-soil interaction behavior is studied based on the displacement coupling condition in the proposed method, capable of accurately considering tunnel-soil interaction behavior. Subsequently, with the verified proposed analytical solution, further parametric studies are performed to investigate the spatial factors affecting tunnel behavior including tunnel buried depth, excavation-tunnel relative distance, excavation geometry, skew angle between tunnel axis, short side of the excavation, and excavation depth, yielding abundant artificial data. Then, a semi-empirical formula considering spatial effect is established for directly predicting the maximum vertical displacement of the tunnel with adequate engineering accuracy and applicability.

During the long-term demographic transition, the health of the elderly has become an important consideration in urban planning and management. The health of the elderly is a complex issue. However, previous studies have mainly focused on the health defects related to disease incidence, loss of function, mortality, etc., yet a comprehensive evaluation of health status is lacking. The Cumulative Health Deficit Index (CHDI) is a composite index that combines psychological and physiological indicators. Health deficits can reduce the quality of life of the elderly and increase the burden on families, cities and even society, so it is indispensable to understand the individual factors and regional factors that affect CHDI. The research on the spatial differentiation of CHDI and its driving factors can provide scientific geographic information basis for the construction of age-friendly cities and healthy city planning. It also has great significance in narrowing the differences in the health status among regions and reducing the overall burden of the country.MethodsThis research analyzed a nationwide dataset, the China Longitudinal Aging Social Survey in 2018 conducted by the Renmin University of China, which contained 11,418 elderly aged 60 years and older from 28 provinces/municipalities/autonomous regions that represent 95% of the population in mainland China. The Cumulative Health Deficit Index (CHDI) was the first time constructed using the entropy-TOPSIS method to evaluate the health status of the elderly. Entropy-TOPSIS is to quantify the importance of each indicator by calculating the entropy value to improve the reliability and accuracy of the results and avoid the influence of previous researchers' subjective assignments and model assumptions on the results. The selected variables include physical health 27 indicators (self-rated health, basic mobility assessment, daily activity ability, disease and treatment) and mental health 36 indicators (cognitive ability, depression and loneliness, social adjustment, and filial piety concept). The research used the Geodetector methods (factor detection and interaction detection) that combined individual and regional indicators to analyze the spatial variation characters and reveal the driving factors of CHDI.ResultsThe weight of mental health indicators (75.73) is three times that of physical health indicators (24.27), and its composition formula is: CHDI value = (14.77% disease and treatment + 5.54% daily activity ability + 2.14% health self-assessment + 1.81% basic mobility assessment) + (33.37% depression and loneliness + 25.21% cognitive ability + 12.46% social adjustment + 4.7% filial piety). Individual CHDI was more associated with age and was more evident in females than males. CHDI average values show the distribution trend of Hu Line (HL) in the geographic information graph that the CHDI in West HL regions are lower than in the East HL regions. The highest CHDI cities are in Shanxi, Jiangsu, and Hubei, whereas the lowest CHDI cities are Inner Mongolia, Hunan and Anhui. The geographical distribution maps of the 5-levels of CHDI levels show very different CHDI classification levels among the elderly in the same region.Further, the top three influential factors are personal income, empty nest, aged 80+, and regional factors also obviously affect CHDI values, such as the proportion participating in insurance, population density, and GDP. The two different factors in individual and regional factors all show a two-factor interaction effect, and enhancement or nonlinear enhancement. The top three ranks are personal income & AND; quality of air (0.94), personal income & AND; GDP (0.94), and personal income & AND; urbanization rate (0.87).ConclusionsCHDI is a subjective and objective comprehensive index, and mental indicators are primary factors. Thus attaching importance to the psychological care of the elderly is the key to building a healthy aging society. The large individual heterogeneity and spatial differentiation of CHDI in the elderly were demonstrated by map visualization. The analysis of the influencing factors of CHDI by the Geodetector method proves that spatial differentiation is mainly affected by individual economic and social security factors, but also by the interaction with regional factors such as quality of air, GDP, and urbanization rate. This research fills a gap in the elderly health status in the field of spatial geography. The results can provide empirical evidence for policymakers to take measures according to local conditions to improve the health status of the elderly according to regional differences in physical and mental conditions. It also plays a guiding role for the country in balancing regional economic development, promoting healthy and sustainable urban development, and creating age-friendly cities.",Elderly,Cumulative Health Deficit Index,CHDI,Geodetector,Spatial variation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The analysis covered 87 cities across seven climate zones in China, examining MAUP in 12 spatial scales to discern the scale and zoning effects on LST and its influencing factors. The research findings were as follows: (1) The sensitivity of LST influencing factors to spatial scales exhibited both spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Significant differences in the q-values of LST influencing factors were observed across various climate zones and periods (daytime and nighttime), with human factors, particularly those related to residents' work, buildings, life, and rest, showing higher spatial scale dependency than natural factors. (2) Zoning effects significantly impacted the q-values of LST influencing factors and were closely linked to the discretization methods and quantities used, which could alter the trends of these q-values. (3) Across the 12 spatial scales, more than 67.34 % of LST influencing factor interaction types were classified as bi-variable enhancement types. The q-values for LST influencing factor interactions were higher and more stable than those of single factors.

It is also the second largest contributor to climate change, after carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), Effective mitigation of BC is of much benefits, but it requires detailed knowledge of its spatial distribution, as well as the influence of local meteorology on the spread of the pollutant. Many countries in sub -Sahara Africa including Nigeria, lack data on BC level. There is also limited information on meteorological impact on BC spatial distribution. This study therefore assessed the spatial and temporal distribution of BC across the 36 states of Nigeria and the influence of meteorology on the pollutant spread. Data on BC surface mass (BCMASS) and seven meteorological variables (air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, wind speed, planetary boundary layer height (PBLH), atmospheric pressure and wind direction) were obtained from Modern Era Retrospective analysis for Research (MERRA -2). Spatial distribution of BCSMASS across 36 states of Nigeria, and interaction with meteorology was studied using correlation analyses, Bayesian ridge regression with marginal maximum likelihood estimation, anda Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. There was significant (p < 0.05) variation in BCSMASS across the states. The meteorological variables, except wind direction, significantly influenced BCSMASS and they accounted for 63% of the variation. Five -day backward trajectory modelled for each month of the year revealed that northern Nigeria is majorly under the influence of the dry and dusty tropical continental wind, and this could partially account for the lower BCSMASS concentration in the region, compared to southern Nigeria.

The super-efficiency SBM model, the nuclear density method, and the spatial autocorrelation method were used to discuss the spatial-temporal CEE characteristics of 105 cities in the YREB. On the driving factors of carbon emissions, the geographic detector and the Tobit model were combined to explore the spatial differentiation characteristics of the driving factors from the perspective of heterogeneity, and concurrently analyze the single-factor's effecting intensity and impacting direction, as well as the dual-factors' interaction effects. The findings indicated that the CEE of YREB generally showed a slow upward trend during 2006-2021.

However, it is still not clear how vegetation resilience is evolving in response to climate change in pivotal biographical zones. Here, we examined the resilience changes in terms of leaf area index (LAI, an indicator of canopy structure) and gross primary productivity (GPP, an indicator of carbon uptake) in responding to the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) over China's Loess Plateau and Qinling Mountains. Linking remote sensing variables and tree ring width allows the upscaling of plot-based vegetation growth information. We further explored potential explanatory factors associated with the heterogeneous spatial distributions of resilience changes. Results revealed that the resilience of GPP weakened more than LAI in response to drought, suggesting that compared to LAI, productivity requires more time to recover to the pre-drought levels. Regionally, the change of vegetation resilience on the Loess Plateau and in high-altitude areas was highly susceptible to SPEI and VPD, respectively. The observed spatial heterogeneity in resilience changes was mainly attributed by climate zone, water deficit, and their interactions.

Previous empirical studies have confirmed that landscape patterns inextricably linked with the thermal environment, but static results based on a single temporal cross section of image data provide only a partial understanding. In this paper, we constructed a dynamic framework using Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) for temperature simulation and Geodetector to study the landscape factors and their interactions that influence near-surface temperature (NST) changes in the Guanzhong Plain Urban Agglomeration (GPUA) between 2000 and 2020. Results showed that the GPUA average NST increased by 0.012 degrees C and 0.053 degrees C in January and July from 2000 to 2020, respectively. In terms of the dynamic correlation between landscape patterns and NST, cropland (CPL) was negative, urban land (UBL) was positive, and the remainder of the landscapes differed in winter and summer. Furthermore, results from the Geodetector showed that UBL embodied a stronger influence in summer than during winter months. This finding helps to explain why the average NST increase is higher in summer than during winter. The Dynamic Q values (DQ) of the area-based landscape metrics were generally larger than those of other spatial configuration metrics, and the interaction results showed that the landscape metrics of various land-cover classifications were enhanced, indicating that the superposition effect among landscape metrics needs to be taken into account in landscape planning in addition to area factors. The study of the relationship between landscape patterns and thermal environment considering dynamic perspective using WRF offers an important theoretical reference allied with practical guidance for understanding and adapting to forthcoming change in our climate through which we can help drive sustainable development decisions of the GPUA.",Landscape pattern,Near-surface temperature,Weather Research and Forecasting Model,(WRF),Dynamic analysis,Guanzhong Plain Urban Agglomeration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, there is a dearth of literature regarding the comprehensive policy -market mechanisms on the diffusion of plastic greenhouses. We combine the strength of spatial lag Tobit and BRT models to examine respective roles of policy and market as well as their intrinsic interactions in facilitating PMF growth. Our analysis reveals that both state promotion of food localization policies and spatial proximity to markets increase the intensity of PMF, and market -driven forces are confirmed to be the preponderant determinant. State investments in city -region vegetable production bases exert moderating effect on market-PMF linkages by alleviating market constraints on greenhouses adoption in remote farming regions, while direct policy effects show heterogeneity with different road accessibility, signaling a complex interplay in the interaction mechanism. The counterfactual simulation further emphasize a synergistic effect of policy -market confluence on PMF expansion, suggesting a robust combination of state interventions and market mechanisms.

Dependencies between socioeconomic profile, residential location, preferences and behavior make this kind of analysis difficult. Further, beyond understanding where diverse social interactions take place, it is important to know whether increasing access to those types of spaces via changes to the transportation network can actually increase the level of diversity in social interactions-a more causal question that remains relatively unexplored in the literature. This study presents new perspectives on analyzing social mixing and socioeconomic integration in cities using geolocated cellphone data. Using a call detail record dataset which describes the movements of over one million cell phone users in Stockholm, Sweden, this study quantifies the contribution of access to various types of urban amenities to one's exposure to people with diverse income levels. Our results provide evidence that areas of the city with more libraries, educational institutions, healthcare establishments, parks and restaurants host more exposures between people who are different from one another in terms of income. Further, we leverage random shocks to the transportation network that come from maintenance-based road closures to identify a causal relationship between access to parks, services and healthcare establishments and experienced income diversity.

It is intended that the thermal/aerodynamic effects of UGI be analyzed and the influence of UGI at three spatial scales within urban communities be provided; more specifically: microclimate scale, building scale, and individual scale. The study discusses the findings of 218 papers published since 2010 to elaborate on recent progress in this field. This review delves into three fundamental aspects related to UGI: a) the underlying mechanisms allowing UGI to affect the environment and human health, b) the modeling efforts undertaken to simulate these effects, and c) measurement studies providing empirical data and verifying the models. Additionally, the effects of UGI across the three scales and related aspects are discussed, and the importance of integrative mechanisms and coupled modeling approaches is emphasized. Key methodologies for integrating microclimate and building simulations are summarized, highlighting the data exchange protocols and software tools. In contrast to previous reviews, this study has analyzed major measurement studies, categorizing them into full-scale and sub-scale studies.

High levels of Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) can help mitigate a series of ecological problems faced by cities, which is extremely important for preserving the stability of urban ecosystems and promoting sustainable urban development. However, current research has not fully explored the influencing factors of UGI and the interaction effect between them. Therefore, in order to better explore the results of China's proposed policy to promote GI development, data from 110 cities in China's Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) region during the 12th Five-Year Plan and 13th Five-Year Plan periods were measured separately, and natural and geographic environmental conditions, quality of urban construction, level of economic development, sociocultural development, and eco-environmental quality were selected as the influencing factors. The entropy TOPSIS was used to evaluate the development trend of UGI in the two periods of the region, and the relationship between influencing factors and UGI development was investigated through the use of fs/QCA, and the high-level development path of each city to achieve GI was explained. The results show that (1) Cities with high UGI development are mostly concentrated in economically developed areas, while cities in the YREB's central and western regions have relatively low levels of UGI development. (2) According to the spatial and temporal differences, the factors driving the high level and non-high level of UGI development in prefecture-level cities in the YREB showed several different configurations, confirming that the development level of UGI was affected by a variety of conditions.

This study aimed to systematically evaluate the ESs of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River Urban Agglomeration (MRYRUA) across multiple spatial and temporal scales, thereby enhancing ecosystem management and informed scientific decision-making. Specifically, this study employed the InVEST model, hot spot analysis, a geographically weighted regression model, and self-organizing feature mapping combined with K-means clustering to systematically quantify the spatiotemporal characteristics, trade-offs, synergies, and ecosystem service clusters of habitat quality (HQ), water yield (WY), carbon storage (CS), soil conservation (SC), and landscape aesthetics (LA) at grid and county scales from 2000 to 2020. The results revealed the following: (1) There was significant spatial heterogeneity among various ESs, with an overall spatial pattern exhibiting layered and interwoven variations. (2) Trade-offs predominantly characterized the relationships among ESs in the MRYRUA, with the absolute values of correlation coefficients mostly reaching their nadir in 2010.

We aim to assess mismanaged solid waste interactions with WASH that affect urban households and whether integrated waste-WASH indicators can be constructed to monitor these interactions. Via literature review, we identify three trade-offs and seven synergies between WASH and waste management for urban households. Trade-offs arise from consumption of water packaged in bottles or bags and disposable diapers (DDs), whilst synergies include opportunities for households with water services to wash separated waste or cloth diapers. One trade-off (packaged water consumption) has grown rapidly in southeast Asia and West Africa. Household surveys for Ghana and Kenya demonstrate that the urban population lacking waste collection services overlaps strongly with those lacking WASH services. In Kenya, 3.3 million people simultaneously lacked waste collection, hygiene, and basic sanitation services. Finally, we construct indicators from household survey micro-data to measure DD and packaged water consumption in households lacking waste services. Case studies show that from 2012-13 to 2016-17, packaged water consumption grew among Ghanaian households burning or dumping waste, whilst most urban Nigerian households consuming DD lack waste collection services. We conclude that household survey micro-data can be used to construct tradeoff measures to inform policy and target services towards populations simultaneously exposed to uncollected waste and lacking WASH services. However, such analyses require an institutional mechanism to coordinate cross-goal monitoring and greater survey data harmonisation. In countries where large populations lack both waste collection and WASH services or with growing DD or packaged water consumption, balanced evidence is needed on DD and packaged water's impacts from both WASH and solid waste management perspectives.",Low and middle-income countries,Solid waste,Sustainable development goals,Water,Sanitation and hygiene,Urban planning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Much of the research that does address social processes focuses primarily on their effects on biotic community composition, with less attention paid to how social processes affect species interactions. Linking social processes to ecological outcomes is complicated by high spatial heterogeneity in cities and the potential for scale mismatch between social and ecological processes, and the indicators used to assess those processes. Here, we assessed how social and ecological processes jointly influence the frequency and outcomes of species interactions among the native perennial vine Gelsemium sempervirens and its insect pollinators, nectar robbers, and florivores across 28 residential subdivisions in the Research Triangle region, NC, USA. We integrated data on socioeconomic attributes (mean property value, mean property size, subdivision age), vegetation attributes (forest cover and richness and density of managed and unmanaged floral resources), species interactions (conspecific and heterospecific pollen deposition, nectar robbing, florivory), and Gelsemium reproduction (fruit set, seeds per fruit) using structural equation modeling to understand the causal links between socioeconomic attributes, vegetation attributes, and interaction frequency and outcome. Among socioeconomic attributes, property value was the strongest predictor of interaction frequency, having both direct and vegetation-mediated indirect effects on pollination and florivory. However, the effect of socioeconomic attributes on plant reproduction was small. Overall, we were able to explain only a small amount of the variation in any species interaction or reproduction measure. This may be due to the functional similarity of subdivisions, despite large variation in both socioeconomic and vegetation attributes, or may reflect scale mismatch between the ecological and socioeconomic variables.

Through a survey of 1096 individuals in Tehran, Iran, this research examines the impact of individual characteristics, the living environment, and transport and mobility options on residents' capabilities using the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique. Therefore, the study evaluates one model for the entire population and two sub-groups defined by high and low capability levels. The findings indicate that individual characteristics significantly predict the level of capabilities, with a stronger effect observed in the low-capability group. Also, individual characteristics positively affect the environmental constructs, with a stronger effect observed among the low-capability group. Importantly, the low-capability group experiences a mismatch between their level of education, job status, and income level. Regarding environmental factors, the road network, public transport performance, land usetransport system integration, land use diversity, and land use spatial distribution exhibit a considerable relationship with residents' capabilities.

But the possibilities of modern software that allows detecting intraagglomeration spatial reserves - spatial potentials - on cartographic models are not taken into account. The work uses spatial -functional and synergetic (agglomeration) approaches, as well as potential method, statistical method and cartographic modeling. We reveal the theoretical basis for the formation of spatial potentials in the intra-agglomeration environment and propose a methodological approach to their determination based on agglomeration effects of demographic, settlement and economic structures of the Saint Petersburg agglomeration. According to the calculations obtained, we design cartographic models that correspond to the structures under consideration and reflect spatial potentials of agglomeration effects, which are represented by groups of five clusters. The levels of clusters of spatial potentials and their configurations are obtained with the help of the neural network software ""Surfer Golden Software"". We find that groups of clusters within the demographic and settlement potentials structure - gravitational, high -potential, medium -potential and low -potential - have smaller territorial impact areas in contrast to similar groups of clusters of economic structure.

Using MODIS LST data and the Geodetector model, we compared the spatiotemporal variations of LST and their drivers in super megacities (Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Shenzhen), a megacity (Xi'an), large cities (Urumqi and Harbin), and a small and medium-sized city (Lhasa). The LST of super megacities is primarily influenced by socioeconomic factors (11 %- 61 %), whereas natural factors significantly impact the LST of large cities and small to mediumsized cities (15 %-58 %). Socioeconomic factors contributed more significantly to daytime LST in Xi'an (68 %). Elevation is a crucial factor influencing the spatial heterogeneity of LST, and the enhanced vegetation index predominantly dictates the spatial variation of LST through its interactions with other factors. The interaction between various factors significantly enhances their contributions to LST. According to the urban heat island ratio index, Lhasa exhibited the highest urban heat stress risk (>0.83) during both day and night, whereas Harbin displayed the lowest (<0.34). Beijing possessed the highest urban heat risk rating among the super megacities. Xi'an's risk level decreased significantly at night.

It also marked the beginning of a half-century trend of profit-oriented private gardens. The development process from rural outskirts to bustling commercial areas is exemplified by the area of Bubbling Well Road, making it significant for the study of urban transformation in early modern times in Shanghai. In this work, private gardens in the vicinity of Bubbling Well Road are examined as hierarchical elements of urban subdivision using the layering approach of the Historic Urban Landscape. Based on summarizing the trajectory of different types of private gardens under urbanization, typical time nodes were extracted and then horizontally correlated with the process of urbanization to elucidate the hierarchical logic underlying the symbiotic interaction between private gardens and cities. The results show that private gardens have created new hot spots and gathered a lot of popularity for the Jing'an Temple area, prompting this area to gradually evolve from a traditional town to a ""backyard garden"" of Concession dominated by the entertainment industry. Through the rapid development of the modern entertainment, commerce, and real estate industries, the Jing'an Temple area successfully embraced the trend of developing Concession to the West while achieving transformations in business models and urban style. Finally, with the assistance of the transitional entertainment space, such as profit-oriented gardens, the Jing'an Temple area has successfully undergone a transformation into a modern entertainment industry hub and solidified its commercial status as the ""consumption circle"" of Shanghai. We systematically investigated the significance of the urban subdivision layer in relation to the temporal changes in the urban environmental structure and the evolution of spatial organization patterns at the macro level; this helps deepen the historical urban landscape approach from an ideological framework level to the practical level.",historic urban landscape,layering,early modern times shanghai,bubbling well road,private gardens,subdivision layer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the increasing interactions between power distribution networks and natural gas networks bring new challenges to the fast recovery of energy systems. Mobile emergency resources, such as repair crews (RCs), play an essential role in the restoration. However, power distribution networks and gas networks have geographical correlations with transportation systems in urban areas, therefore, there exists spatial interdependency between infrastructural systems. This property results in the dependency between RCs' routings and road states in transportation systems. To this end, this paper proposes a sequential restoration model for power-gas-transportation distribution networks. The post-disaster restoration model contains the dispatch of both RCs and fixed resources. The spatial interdependency is modeled by modified Boolean logic equations to obtain feasible recovery schedules in practice. Convex relaxations and linearization methodologies are utilized to transform the proposed model into a mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) model. Simulations are carried out on 33-14-20 and 136-20-39 bus coupled systems. Numerical results indicate that the proposed restoration strategy could increase the post-disaster resilience index by 19.5 % in 33-bus power system, 8.7 % in 136-bus power system, 25.6 % in 14-node gas system, and 27.2 % in 20-node gas system, respectively.",Post-disaster restoration,Power-gas distribution network,Traffic network,Spatial interdependency,Energy hub,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While constructing ecological networks is a productive strategy for achieving a balance between ecological protection and urbanization, the limited research conducted on the impacts of LUCC on the spatial patterns of ecological networks during urbanization poses a hindrance to the scientific construction of ecological networks. Therefore, this study focuses on Jinan City, an important city situated in the downstream region of the Yellow River Basin, China. The study utilized simulation approaches, including MSPA, MCR, InVEST model and gravity model, to investigate and analyze the ecological networks of Jinan City from 2000 to 2020. A set of patterns capturing the changes in ecological network elements was proposed to explore the evolutionary characteristics of the spatial pattern of ecological networks. Finally, Geodetector was utilized to investigate the impact mechanism of LUCC on the spatial pattern of ecological networks. The study findings indicate that: (1) During the last two decades, the urban development in Jinan City has witnessed an expansion of approximately 588.83 km2, and the proportion of ecological land has also increased, but the overall structure and spatial distribution of construction and ecological land are not balanced. (2) Despite the expansion of ecological areas, the escalation of ecological resistance has resulted in significant degradation of the functional capacity of ecological corridors, with a decrease of 8.37 % in the number of pri-mary corridors. The reduced spatial connectivity of the ecological networks has impeded the efficient cycling of ecological processes between ecosystems. (3) The complex interactions and cumulative effects of LUCC during urbanization led to the evolution of the spatial pattern of ecological networks. The transformation of cropland and construction into ecological land has improved the composition elements of the ecological network, while the encroachment on ecological land and disorderly changes in internal types are the principal factors causing the degradation of ecological network composition elements. (4) The spatial pattern of ecological networks in Jinan City is influenced by the coupling of urban expansion and ecological protection policies. However, there is a need for the government to strengthen policy coordination and optimize spatial layout to better manage and conserve ecological networks.

Methods We quantified WUI growth and characterised large (>200 ha) wildfire regimes inside and outside the WUI at multiple spatial scales across the eastern US between 1986 and 2021. Key results WUI wildfires in the eastern US comprised 45% of all large wildfires and 55% of the area burned, were on average 46% larger than non-WUI wildfires, and are becoming more frequent in spring. Most increases in wildfire number and area burned occurred outside of the WUI. Conclusion The WUI plays an important role in large wildfire dynamics in the eastern US; however, increases in the number of large wildfires have occurred primarily outside the WUI.

Nevertheless, the impact of pure sea breeze (PSB), characterized by a prevailing wind direction perpendicular to the coastline, on UHI remains rarely unexplored. In this study, the PSB events from 2015 to 2022 in Tianjin are identified using 10-m wind observations, and their occurrence frequency is found to show significant seasonality with least frequency in autumn. Besides, we identify the event of all sea breeze (ASB), as well as the days with non-sea breeze (NSB), and the PSB events are found to only account for about one tenth of ASB events. To analyze the potential impact of PSB on UHI, we propose a term of urban-rural temperature difference (URTD) to represent UHI. This is implemented by calculating the difference of 2-m air temperature (T2m) at the city center station of Tianjin minus T2m at other meteorological stations along both directions: the PSB prevailing direction (PSB_H), and the direction perpendicular to PSB_H (PSB_V). Results show that the URTD in the presence of PSB tends to decline gradually from the coastline to the city center along the PSB_H. In contrast, the URTD doesn't change much along the direction of PSB_V. Shifting focus to the direction of PSB_H, the most pronounced alterations in URTD (upstream minus downstream) are found in the presence of PSB (2.14 degrees C), compared with ASB (0.85 degrees C) and NSB (0.57 degrees C). This indicates that the most substantial variation in URTD from coastline to city center occurs under the influence of PSB compared to others. Finally, a case study by comparing PSB against NSB is conducted, which confirms the above-mentioned phenomena.

Identifying and understanding their potential sources and underlying interactions in urban soils are critical for informed management and risk assessment. This study investigated the potential sources and the spatially varying relationships between 9 PTEs and PAHs in the topsoil of Dublin by combining positive matrix factorisation (PMF) and geographically weighted regression (GWR). The PMF model allocated four possible sources based on species concentrations and uncertainties. The factor profiles indicated the associations with high-temperature combustion (PAHs), natural lithologic factors (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Ni), mineralisation and mining (Zn), as well as anthropogenic inputs (Cu, Hg, Pb), respectively. In addition, selected representative elements Cr, Zn, and Pb showed distinct spatial interactions with PAHs in the GWR model. Negative relationships between PAHs and Cr were observed in all samples, suggesting the control of Cr concentrations by natural factors. Negative relationships between PAHs and Zn in the eastern and north-eastern regions were related to mineralisation and anthropogenic Zn-Pb mining. In contrast, the surrounding regions exhibited a natural relationship between these two variables with positive coefficients. Increasing positive coefficients from west to east were observed between PAHs and Pb in the study area. This special pattern was consistent with prevailing south-westerly wind direction in Dublin, highlighting the predominant influences on PAHs and Pb concentrations from vehicle and coal combustion through atmospheric deposition.

But this view was established by considering the spatial organization of urban infrastructure and social networks-the urban ""arteries"" effects- but neglecting the functional organization of urban production and consumption entities-the urban ""organs"" effects. Here, adopting a metabolic view and using water consumption as a proxy for metabolism, we empirically quantify the scaling of entity number, size, and metabolic rate for the functionally specific urban residential, commercial, public or institutional, and industrial sectors. Sectoral urban metabolic scaling is highlighted by a disproportionate coordination between residential and enterprise metabolic rates, attributable to the functional mechanisms of mutualism, specialization, and entity size effect. The resultant whole-city metabolic scaling exhibits a constant superlinear exponent for water-abundant regions in numerical agreement with superlinear urban productivity, with varying exponent deviations for water-deficient regions explainable as adaptations to climate-driven resource constraints. These results present a functional organizational, non-social-network explanation of superlinear urban scaling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As framings of conservation evolve to consider the interdependence between species and human needs, there is a growing recognition of the importance of NCP and biodiversity in conservation actions. However, knowledge on the interactions and spatial repartition of NCP and biodiversity remains limited. Here we show a comprehensive spatial assessment for 15 NCP and one biodiversity - distribution of threatened species - indicators in Switzerland. Indicators values were computed using a panel of mapping and modelling methods extracted from the literature, or specifically developed for this study. Through the analysis of their relationships, we reveal significant trade-offs and synergies in the spatial repartition of these indicators. Results from a spatial bundle analysis performed on the 16 indicators revealed the existence of four bundles showing a heterogeneous repartition over the Swiss landscape. Furthermore, we identified that topography (slope), climate (temperature and precipitations), and habitat (forest and meadows) were among the most influential factors to explain the spatial distribution of the four bundles. We conclude that various significant relationships exist between NCP and biodiversity indicators in Switzerland, emphasizing the importance of informed conservation approaches considering both NCP and biodiversity supply.

In this manuscript, we present the observations of the atmospheric boundary layer in the Houston, Texas, area during the Coastal Urban Boundary Layer Experiment (CUBE) from June through September 2022. In order to understand the unique characteristics of the coastal urban boundary layer, we collected mean and turbulence data from micrometeorological towers and ground-based remote sensing instruments installed in the urban, coastal, bay, and rural sections within the greater Houston region. Furthermore, an urbanized weather research and forecast (WRF) model incorporating the Building Effect Parameterization and Building Energy Model (BEP-BEM) scheme is used to recognize the spatial variability of the meteorological conditions in the Houston Metro area. Compared to non-urban sites, the urban site exhibits a higher near-surface temperature throughout the day, with the highest temperature difference occurring at night due to the redistribution of the stored heat as sensible heat. During the dry period in June, we observed comparatively higher sensible heat flux in the urban site, demonstrating the heat island effect and lower latent heat flux due to lack of vegetation. The urban site had higher TKE values throughout the day than other sites because of the uneven roughness of the landscape. One of the unique findings of this study is the shift in spectral characteristics along the coastal-rural-urban transect. The power and co-spectra of zonal and vertical velocities and the vertical heat flux during the convective periods varied significantly across all the sites. The coastal site was influenced mainly by the local bay breeze shifting the peak to higher frequencies. The boundary layer height in the urban site was generally greater than in bay and rural sites due to increased convection in urban areas resulting from anthropogenic modification of land cover and waste heat from air conditioning use.

The results indicated that the TLRUA experienced accelerated urbanization between 2000 and 2018, with LUT and ESs exhibiting distinct characteristics in urban, suburban, and rural areas in different regions. The impact of LUT on ESs, as we analyzed them from different dimensions, embraced interactive effects and significant spatial spillover effects.

But why choose green innovation as the driver for urban eco-efficiency? How did it do? Based on ecological civilization demonstration zone in China (Yangtze River Economic Belt) city data from 2006 to 2019. This research developed comprehensive evaluation systems to measure both urban green innovation and ecoefficiency, making use of the SBM model with undesired output to gauge ecological efficiency of urban areas. On this basis, we extended analysis by applying a baseline regression model and a Spatial Durbin model to delve into the mechanisms of green innovation affects eco-efficiency. The results are as follows. (1) green innovation and urban eco-efficiency showed fluctuating upward trends but that regional heterogeneity existed among the three regions. Specifically, the lower reaches outperform in green innovation, closely followed by the middle and upper reaches. Concurrently, the eco-efficiency levels of the middle reaches surpass those of the lower and upper reaches. (2) Our findings confirmed that green innovation promotes eco-efficiency by pursuing economic growth while reducing externalities. Furthermore, green innovation and eco-efficiency exhibit a positive spatial correlation and benefits neighboring city's' eco-efficiency, revealing spatial spillover effect. (3) Technological progress and industrial restructuring, driven by green innovation practices, emerge as pivotal drivers for the improvement in eco-efficiency.

Social interactions are intuitively heterogeneous and dynamic over time and circumstances, making them hard to explain. In this paper, we creatively investigate modeling interpretable social interactions for pedestrian trajectory, which is not considered by the existing trajectory prediction research. Moreover, we propose a two-stage methodology for interaction modeling- ""mode extraction""and ""mode aggregation"", and develop a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based model for long-term trajectory prediction, which naturally takes into account multi-types of social interactions. Different from previous models that do not explain how pedestrians interact socially, we extract latent modes that represent social interaction types which scales to an arbitrary number of neighbors. Extensive experiments over two public datasets have been conducted. The quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our method is able to capture the multi-modality of human motion and achieve better performance under specific conditions. Its performance is also verified by the interpretation of predicted modes, of which the results are in accordance with common sense. Besides, we have performed sensitivity analysis on the crucial hyperparameters in our model.

It assists self-driving vehicles to efficiently and safely complete a series of driving decisions and route planning by virtue of having most of the accurate and reliable prior information in the road environment. With the continuous change of technology, there are higher requirements for the accuracy, richness and freshness of the information stored in the HD map, so as to assist the practical application of automatic driving technology. However, current research related to HD maps mainly focuses on static information in the road environment. Since there is a large amount of complex, variable and uncertain dynamic information in the road environment, it can be used as prior knowledge for self-driving to make better decisions. Therefore, the research focus of this paper is on the dynamic information. We propose to use HD map as an information system - high definition map information system (HDMIS) - to assist autonomous driving vehicles. We design the specific content of dynamic information in the HDMIS, and develop an information interaction approach based on the vehicle end of the self-driving car and the HDMIS cloud as the interactive subject of dynamic information. In the experiment, we design and build three types of specific traffic scenarios on the simulation platform, and verify the effectiveness of the interaction approach by using the database to perform information interaction between different ports. The results show that our interaction approach can meet the storage and release of dynamic information by HDMIS to a certain extent, and can provide a large amount of dynamic information for autonomous vehicles to help them complete subsequent driving decisions and planning.",High Definition Map,Dynamic Information,Information Interaction,Simulation Scenario,Database Technology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Women and their new positions at home and in society have been influential factors in house structure changes in the last few centuries. As a place that plays a crucial role in identifying and reproducing social values, the house has always changed to express and harmonize with the residents' beliefs. Since today the trend of changes in women's roles and social identity is changing rapidly, examining the developments in the past few centuries, identifying the influential factors, strategies applied, and the results of these changes can be an excellent way to predict and present patterns suitable for the house in the future.Research objective: The purpose of this article is to compare the spatial structure between the houses of the 17th to 21st century in Europe with the houses of Iran from the Qajar period until now by focusing on the social status of women. For this purpose, the evolution of spatial organization in Iran and Europe was examined separately then the differences and similarities between them in the same period were scrutinized.Research method: This study employed the interpretive-historical method, logical reasoning, and comparative analogy to investigate the relationship and the two-way effects of the spatial structure of the house and the social position of women by using the longitudinal and transverse analogy.Conclusion: The results show that there is a direct relationship between women's social status improvement and the composition of the gender domains of the home. With the improvement of this position, the spatial quality of feminine territories has increased, and many gender valuations of spaces and functions have been eliminated, which has finally led to the balancing of gender roles in the home.",House spatial organization,Women,Gender domain,Women's social status,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While there is a relatively good empirical and theoretical understanding of city size distributions, insights about their spatial organization remain on a conceptual level. Here, we analyze empirically the correlations between the sizes of cities (in terms of area) across long distances. Therefore, we (i) define city clusters, (ii) obtain the neighborhood network from Voronoi cells, and (iii) apply a fluctuation analysis along all shortest paths. We find that most European countries exhibit long-range correlations but in several cases these are anti-correlations. In an analogous way, we study a model inspired by Central Places Theory and find that it leads to positive long-range correlations, unless there is strong additional spatial disorder-contrary to intuition. We conclude that the interactions between cities extend over large distances reaching the country scale.

Shaped by urbanization policies, this locale has encountered a gamut of issues, including an imbalance in human-environment dynamics and the degradation of ecological integrity. Consequently, the comprehension of how urban expansion impacts the optimization of regional landscape configurations, the alignment of human-environment interactions in the Loess Plateau's hilly and gully domains, and the mitigation of urban ecological challenges assumes paramount importance. Leveraging data from land use remote sensing monitoring, alongside inputs from natural geography and socio-economic spheres, and employing methodologies such as landscape pattern indices, we conduct an exhaustive analysis of Zichang City's urban fabric from 1980 to 2020. Furthermore, employing the CLUE-S model, we undertake multifaceted scenario simulations to forecast urban expansion in Zichang City through to 2035. Our findings delineate two distinct phases in Zichang City's urban expansion trajectory over the past four decades. From 1980 to 2000, urban construction land in Zichang City experienced a phase of methodical and steady growth, augmenting by 64.98 hectares, alongside a marginal decrease in the landscape shape index (LSI) by 0.02 and a commensurate increase in the aggregation index (AI) by 1.17. Conversely, from 2000 to 2020, urban construction land in Zichang City witnessed an epoch of rapid and haphazard expansion, doubling in expanse, marked by a notable escalation in LSI (2.45) and a corresponding descent in the AI (2.85). The precision of CLUE-S model simulations for Zichang City's land use alterations registers at 0.88, fulfilling the exigent demand for further urban expansion and land use change prognostication. Under the aegis of the natural development scenario, the augmentation of urban construction land in Zichang City primarily encroaches upon grassland, farmland, and woodland, effectuating an increase of 159.81 hectares. Conversely, under the ambit of urbanization development, urban construction land contends predominantly with farmland, grassland, and woodland, heralding an augmentation of 520.42 hectares. Lastly, under the mantle of ecological protection, urban construction land expansion predominantly encroaches upon grassland, farmland, and woodland, resulting in an augmentation of 4.27 hectares. Through a nuanced analysis of the spatiotemporal evolution of urban expansion and scenario-based simulations, this study endeavors to furnish multi-faceted, scenario-driven, and policy-centric insights for regional planning, urban spatial delineation, and regional ecological safeguarding.",urban expansion,multi-scenario simulation,CLUE-S model,hilly and gully region of Loess Plateau,Zichang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A vital challenge to the effectiveness of TOD is the spatial discordance between urban transit and land development. Despite a recent surge of interest in the relationship of rail transit and land use, the conclusions are predominantly confined to the metro station area. The key land-use characteristics pivotal to gaging the sustainability of TOD, such as the proportion of commercial land and the ratio of green spaces, remain insufficiently scrutinized. Therefore, this study evaluates if and how rail transit development has integrated land use citywide, with a particular focus on green spaces, commercial value, land-use diversity, and job-housing spaces. We developed a citywide grid-scale index of rail transit accessibility (CRTA) and constructed coordination models based on multidimensional spatial data and bivariate spatial autocorrelation analysis. The results imply the following: 1) Residence, employment, and the diversity of functional facilities, influenced by market and individual preference exhibit a robust spatial coordination with CRTA. But government-led planned commercial land demonstrates a poor coordination with CRTA, and there is a pronounced incoordination between planned green spaces and CRTA. 2) There are significant disparities in the interactive relationships between CRTA and various land-use characteristics across urban and suburban settings. In urban areas, there is a high level of coordinated development between rail transit networks and land use, although this is influenced by physical segmentation and planning policies. In suburban areas, rail transit plays a guiding role in land development, but the development of rail transit fails to keep up with that of land use. Finally, the study provides recommendations for coordinating rail transit with land-use characteristics in both urban and suburban areas, and identifies key areas where improvements in rail transit accessibility are most urgently required.",Transit oriented development,TOD assessment,Rail transit and land use,Coordination,Interaction type,Shenzhen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Typically, human suffering and financial loss in a disaster are unevenly distributed among different communities due to their social vulnerability levels, which weaken the capacity to respond to and recover from disasters. Therefore, understanding social vulnerability distribution is crucial to explain how communities experience the same hazard event differently and support community resilience management. However, current assessment methods (e.g., CDC/ATSDR SVI) often regard social vulnerability as a static concept and assume that residents do all activities within their home community, which is in contract with the fact that there are inter-communities interaction due to human mobility. To solve this problem, this paper proposed a framework integrating human vulnerability and mobility trajectories to create a spatial-temporal community social vulnerability assessment. Through the process, we will first use Markov Chain to simulate activity schedules of different vulnerability groups defined by the CDC. Then, we will track the location-based mobility of people with positioning data collected from mobile devices. After that, a connection between vulnerability-based activity schedules and location-based mobility trajectories will be established to integrate humans, activity, and location together for generating vulnerable people distribution. Finally, we will evaluate the community vulnerability level with the new vulnerable people distribution among different communities to get the spatial-temporal vulnerability assessment result. This can help improve the community's resilience against hazardous events by making in-time response strategies for different vulnerable people. Besides that, this can also benefit daily energy planning with minimum economic and safety risks to improve the community's resilience.",human mobility,trajectory simulation,community vulnerability,spatial temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These services are difficult to assess because they are non-material, vary spatially and have strong perceptual characteristics. Data obtained from social media can provide spatially-explicit information regarding some in-situ cultural ecosystem services by serving as a proxy for visitation. These data can identify environmental characteristics (natural, human and built capital) correlated with visitation and, therefore, the types of places used for in-situ environmental interactions. A range of spatial models can be applied in this way that vary in complexity and can provide information for ecosystem service assessments. We deployed four models (global regression, local regression, maximum entropy and the InVEST recreation model) to the same case-study area, County Galway, Ireland, to compare spatial models. A total of 6,752 photo-user-days (PUD) (a visitation metric) were obtained from Flickr. Data describing natural, human and built capital were collected from national databases. Results showed a blend of capital types correlated with PUD suggesting that local context, including biophysical traits and accessibility, are relevant for in-situ cultural ecosystem service flows. Average trends included distance to the coast and elevation as negatively correlated with PUD, while the presence of major roads and recreational sites, population density and habitat diversity were positively correlated.

While conventional transportation studies focus on utilitarian decision-making, this research investigates the complex interplay between human-environment interactions and emotional attachments to places, which influence transportation choices. Specifically, we examine the impact of sense of place in pedestrian route choice within a densely populated urban university community. Unlike typical urban settings characterized by clear roads and landmarks, university environments often feature intricate layouts with diffuse pathways, shared spaces, and a lack of clear spatial hierarchies. This complexity challenges conventional spatial knowledge acquisition methods. Individuals navigating such environments tend to rely on socio-sensory wayfinding strategies, developing emotional connections to specific places and routes over time. Consequently, route choices in these contexts may not always be deliberate but rather subconscious and nuanced. Our study focuses on elucidating the impact of the sense of place-a composite of conscious and subconscious perceptions, emotions, and attachments to a location-on daily route decisions. Through structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis, we demonstrate that the sense of place significantly influences route choices within community building complexes, surpassing utilitarian considerations as a primary explanatory factor.

These dynamics are affected by a variety of variables, spanning economic, structural, political and environmental. With respect to this latter aspect, much research has explored the relationship between the development of urban green areas, the increase of price and the formation of gentrification. Within this context, the present work explores housing mobility and gentrification dynamics proposing a mixed-method approach that combines a spatially explicit agent-based model (ABM), a Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and a Hedonic Price (HP). The case study of the transformation project of Victoria Park in Brisbane (Australia) is used to verify the applicability of this integrated approach. In the methodological framework proposed, the ABM simulates the housing mobility of the residents through an individual decision-making process, where the likelihood of mobility is based on various empirical endogenous factors (i.e., household socio-economic characteristics) and exogenous ones (i.e., market variation). The MCDA supports the identification of the relative importance of these factors using a panel of local experts and stakeholders. The Spatial HP explores the impact of urban parks on real estate prices. The current study found the abilities of MCDA and HP to reduce the assumptions of ABM by generating quali-quantitative information of citizens' behaviors and estimating price increase. Moreover, the model highlights the importance of considering both supply and demand sides when analyzing gentrification.
