With this objective, we estimate scope elasticities, which is the relationship between the productivity of the parent firm and the probability of operating abroad in different markets through subsidiaries with the same main activity. Elasticities are estimated for a baseline cross-section of 35 home countries that represent more than 70% of total outward FDI investment at the world level. At the aggregate level, the results indicate quite consistently, through various estimation methods, that a 10% increase in the productivity of the parent firm increases the probability in a range between 0.8-1.0%. Elasticities for manufacturing more than double the elasticities for the service sector. The paper also explores the heterogeneity of scope elasticities across home countries and sectors. This heterogeneity is related to differences across bilateral home-host country characteristics such as the size of the potential host market, bilateral distance and other factors such as institutional quality of host countries and cultural closeness. The signs attached to some of these factors are in general consistent with the predictions of models of firm heterogeneity and FDI activity.",Geographical multinational activity,Scope elasticity,Firm heterogeneity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Respective totals of 124, 206, and 176 households were recruited and their household contacts were followed. Serum samples were collected pre-vaccination, one-month post-vaccination and post-season from children and household contacts for hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. A multivariate logistic model implemented with generalized estimation equations (GEE) was fitted with morbidity or a four-fold increase in HI titer of the household contacts for two consecutive sera as the dependent variable; with geographical location, vaccination status of each household and previous vaccination history as predictor variables.Results: Although our results show no significant reduction in the proportion of infection or clinical morbidity among household contacts, a higher risk of infection, indicated by odds ratio > 1, was consistently observed among household children contacts from the un-vaccinated households after adjusting for confounding variables. Interestingly, a statistically significant lower risk of infection was observed among household adult contacts from rural area when compared to those from urban area (OR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.82-0.97 for Year 2 and OR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.75-0.96 for Year 3).Conclusions: A significant difference in the risk of influenza infection among household adults due to geographical heterogeneity, independent of schoolchildren vaccination status, was revealed in this study.

Row_4,"Leufkens, Daniel",,,The problem of heterogeneity between protected geographical indications: a meta-analysis,BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,2018,26,"Purpose For a long time the European geographical indication (GI) regulation has been of great interest to economists and policymakers. To justify exclusive European regulation it is necessary to prove the positive value of a GI quality signal (i.e. label), which is often achieved by quantifying its monetary value for the consumers. But even though a large number of literary contributions already deal with this question, they lack the evaluation of overall effect sizes for the GI label. The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to quantify and evaluate the overall marginal consumer willingness to pay for the European GI label.Design/methodology/approach To reach this aim, a meta-analysis is used for which a literature survey had been carried out in order to determine the GI label effects (LEs). In addition to previous works, this paper not only includes a meta-analysis, but also implements a heterogeneity analysis to distinguish between the LEs of individual GI standards. To eliminate study- and product-specific determinants of heterogeneity, moderator variables are used.Findings The empirical results indicate that consumers have a highly significant and positive marginal willingness to pay for GIs. However, the marginal willingness to pay differs significantly between the individual GI standards and indicates great heterogeneity between the protected products.Originality/value As an extension to previous studies and meta-analysis; this paper includes the most extensive GIs meta-data set so far, and conducts for the first time an independent heterogeneity analysis to distinguish between the LEs of individual GI standards and implements a moderator analysis to eliminate study- and product-specific determinants of heterogeneity from the GI effects.",Meta-analysis,Heterogeneity,Food label,,,,Geographical indications (GI),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the existing research, heterogeneity and continuity have predominantly been discussed in relation to an analysis of scalar spatial information, i.e. information linked to a single place or a single region.

The first objective is to define functional regions in Slovakia based on daily travel-to-work flows (i.e. ""crisp"" expressions of heterogeneity of space sensu fuzzy set theory). Added value rests in the analyses and cartographic expressions of relative self-containments for resulting functional regions and an orientation of interregional commuting flows.

Geographical detection methods are used for the analysis of traffic accidents in Shenzhen. Results show that spatial stratification heterogeneity does exist, and the influencing factors of fatalities and injuries are different. The traffic accident causes and types of primary responsible party have a strong impact on fatalities and injuries, followed by zones and time interval. However, road factors, lighting, topography, etc., only have a certain impact on fatalities. Drunk driving, speeding over 50%, and overloading are more likely to cause more casualties than other illegal behaviors. Speeding over 50% and speeding below 50% have significant different influences on fatalities, while the influences on injuries are not obvious, and so do drunk driving (Blood Alcohol Concentration >= 0.08) and driving under the influence of alcohol (0.08 > Blood Alcohol Concentration >= 0.02). Both pedestrians and cyclists violating the traffic law are vulnerable to fatality. Heavy truck overloading is more likely to cause major traffic accidents than minibuses. More importantly, there are nonlinear enhanced interactions between the influencing factors, the combination of previous non-significant factors and other factors can have a significant impact on the traffic accident casualties.

The material consists of 1766 unrelated males of Norwegian origin. The geographical distribution of the population sample reflects fairly well the population distribution around the year 1942, which is the median birth year of the index persons. Seven hundred and twenty-one different Y-STR haplotypes but 726 different lineages (Y-STRs plus biallelic markers) were encountered. We observed six known (P*(xRla), BR(xDE, J, N3, P), Rla, N3, DE,J), and one previously undescribed haplogroup (probably a subgroup within haplogroup P*(xRla)). Four of the haplogroups (P*(xRla), BR(xDE, J, N3, P), Rla and N3) represented about 98% of the population sample. The analysis of population pairwise differences indicates that the Norwegian Y-chromosome distribution most closely resembles those observed in Iceland, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark. Within Norway, geographical substructuring was observed between regions and counties. The substructuring reflects to some extent the European Y-chromosome gradients, with higher frequency of P*(xRla) in the south-west and of Rla in the east. Heterogeneity in major founder groups, geographical isolation, severe epidemics, historical trading links and population movements may have led to population stratification and have most probably contributed to the observed regional differences in distribution of haplotypes within two of the major haplogroups.

It has not been investigated, however, if or how the degree distributions vary among types of mutualisms or communities, or between plants and animals in the same network. Here, we evaluate the degree distributions of pollination and seed-dispersal networks, which are two major types of mutualistic networks that have often been discussed in parallel, using an index based on Pielou's evenness. Among 56 pollination networks we found strong negative correlation of the heterogeneity between plants and animals, and geographical shifts of network hubs from plants in temperate regions to animals in the tropics. For 28 seed-dispersal networks, by contrast, the correlation was positive, and there is no comparable geographical pattern. These results may be explained by evolution towards specialization in the presence of context-dependent costs that occur if plants share the animal species as interaction partner.

Nonetheless, little is known about effects of these geographical mosaics on the evolution of genes encoding traits associated with species interactions. Predatory marine snails of the family Conidae use venom, a cocktail of conotoxins, to capture prey. We characterized patterns of geographical variation at five conotoxin genes of a vermivorous species, Conus ebraeus, at Hawaii, Guam and American Samoa, and evaluated how these patterns of variation are associated with geographical heterogeneity in prey utilization. All populations show distinct patterns of prey utilization. Three 'highly polymorphic' conotoxin genes showed significant geographical differences in allelic frequency, and appear to be affected by different modes of selection among populations. Two genes exhibited low levels of diversity and a general lack of differentiation among populations. Levels of diversity of 'highly polymorphic' genes exhibit a positive relationship with dietary breadth. The different patterns of evolution exhibited by conotoxin genes suggest that these genes play different roles in prey capture, and that some genes are more greatly affected by differences in predator-prey interactions than others. Moreover, differences in dietary breadth appear to have a greater influence on the differentiation of venoms than differences in the species of prey.",conotoxin,Conus,predator-prey interactions,,,,selection,geographical variation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The previous studies mainly focused on the effects of different land use patterns and vegetation types on soil hydrological changes worldwide. However, the spatial heterogeneity and driving factors of soil gravimetric water content in alpine regions are seldom studied. On the basis of soil sample collection, combined with geostatistical analysis and the geographical detector method, this study examines the spatial heterogeneity and driving factors of soil gravimetric water content in the typical alpine valley desert of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Results show that the average value of soil gravimetric water content at different depths ranges from 3.68% to 7.84%. The optimal theoretical models of soil gravimetric water content in 0-50 cm layers of the dune are different. The nugget coefficient shows that the soil gravimetric water content in the dune has a strong spatial correlation at different depths, and the range of the optimal theoretical model of semi-variance function is 31.23-63.38 m, which is much larger than the 15 m spacing used for sampling. The ranking of the influence of each evaluation factor on the alpine dune is elevation > slope > location > vegetation > aspect. The interaction detection of factors indicates that an interaction exists among evaluation factors, and no factors are independent of one another. In each soil layer of 0-50 cm, the interaction among evaluation factors has a two-factor enhancement and a nonlinear enhancement effect on soil gravimetric water content. This study contributes to the understanding of spatial heterogeneity and driving factors of soil moisture in alpine deserts, and guidance of artificial vegetation restoration and soil structure analysis of different desert types in alpine cold desert regions.",geographical detector,alpine dunes,spatial heterogeneity,"Wang, Shaoping","Han, Jiahua","Yu, Bo",soil moisture,Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,"Xue, Jie",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The spatial stratified heterogeneity analysis investigates the heterogeneity among various strata of explanatory variables by comparing the spatial variance within strata and that between strata. The geographical detector model is a widely used technique for spatial stratified heterogeneity analysis. In the model, the spatial data discretization and spatial scale effects are fundamental issues, but they are generally determined by experience and lack accurate quantitative assessment in previous studies. To address this issue, an optimal parameters-based geographical detector (OPGD) model is developed for more accurate spatial analysis. The optimal parameters are explored as the best combination of spatial data discretization method, break number of spatial strata, and spatial scale parameter. In the study, the OPGD model is applied in three example cases with different types of spatial data, including spatial raster data, spatial point or areal statistical data, and spatial line segment data, and an R ""GD"" package is developed for computation. Results show that the parameter optimization process can further extract geographical characteristics and information contained in spatial explanatory variables in the geographical detector model. The improved model can be flexibly applied in both global and regional spatial analysis for various types of spatial data. Thus, the OPGD model can improve the overall capacity of spatial stratified heterogeneity analysis.

Policy evaluation, in order to provide reliable results on which to take important legislative decisions, should rely on robust methodological tools. A recent strand of literature casts some doubts about the reliability of the two-way fixed effect estimator when the effect of a treatment is heterogeneous across groups of units or over time. This estimator is widely used in agricultural economics to estimate the effect of policies where effect heterogeneity may be at stake. Using the European geographical indication (GI) policy, we compared the two-way fixed effects estimator with a novel non-parametric estimator that accounts for the issues created by effect heterogeneity. The results show that the two estimators, consistently with the concerns expressed by the technical literature, may lead to different estimates of the policy effect. This suggests that treatment effect heterogeneity is likely a concern when assessing the impact of GI-type policies.

In Greece, the overall relationships between fertility and numerous determinants that influence it have been explored at national level. However, the possible spatial heterogeneity in these relationships has not been investigated at any spatial level. The main objective of this study was to explore the spatial stratified heterogeneity in the relationships between fertility and seven socio-economic determinants at the municipality level of Crete Island, Greece. By using demographic data from two censuses in 2001 and 2011, the fertility was measured as crude birth rate (CBR) and the determinants were created as attributes of urbanization, population density, immigration, marriage, female educational level, female unemployment and male employment. The spatial distributions of fertility and determinants for each year as well as their temporal changes were firstly identified. The majority of municipalities of Crete presented high fertility levels in 2001. Between 2001 and 2011, they showed a decline trend, with some exceptions from municipalities located in the north and south of its four prefectures. Furthermore, the Geographical Detector (GeoDetector) technique was applied to reveal the impact of each determinant and their interactions on fertility. The output results revealed that there was obvious spatial stratified heterogeneity of fertility in the island, which could mostly be explained by the immigration in 2001, and the urbanization and population density in 2011. The impact of marriage and female educational level was lower in both years and different (either positive or negative) among the years.

Despite the effectiveness of directly observed therapy, short course programs in reducing transmission and progression of TB, poverty reduction and socioeconomic development remain crucial factors in decreasing TB incidence. However, the geographical pathway on the planet is not yet clear.ObjectivesThis study was to reconstruct the geographical evolutionary process of TB in 173 countries and territories from 2010 to 2019 to analyze the socioeconomic determinants that impact the global TB epidemic. In addition, the TB incidence in 2030 was predicted.MethodsThis study analyses TB incidence data from 173 countries and territories between 2010 and 2019. The Geotree model would be used to reconstruct the geographical evolutionary process of TB, which provides a simplified schema for geo-visualizing the trajectories of TB incidence and their socioeconomic drivers. Additionally, to estimate the future TB incidence in 2030, a multilevel model was utilized in conjunction with the hierarchical nature of the Geotree based on a stratified heterogeneity analysis.ResultsGlobal TB incidence was found to be associated with the country type and development stages. Between 2010 and 2019, the average TB incidence rate in 173 countries and territories was -27.48%, with marked spatially stratified heterogeneity by country type and development stage. Low-income and lower-middle-income countries were most vulnerable to TB. Upper-middle-income countries experienced a faster decline in TB incidence than high-income countries, and TB incidence generally decreased as the development stage increased, except for the lower-middle development stage in 2019.The highest average rate of decline in TB incidence was observed in the upper-middle development stage of high-income countries, with a reduction of 45.24%. Meanwhile, 37 high-income countries in the high development stage demonstrated an average rate of change of -13.93%. Socioeconomic determinants, including gross domestic product per capita, urbanization rate, and sociodemographic index, were found to inhibit TB incidence. Based on current trends, the predicted average global TB incidence in 2030 is 91.581 per 100,000 population.ConclusionsThe trajectories of the global TB incidence have been reconstructed to formulate targeted public health responses. To eliminate TB, countries at similar development stage can draw on the experiences of countries at higher development stages that are tailored to their unique characteristics.

For these goals to be accomplished, it is important to understand the country's geographical heterogeneity and inequality of access to its drinking-water supply and sanitation (WSS) so that resource allocation and disease control can be optimized. We aimed 1) to estimate spatial heterogeneity of access to improved WSS among the overall Nepalese population at a high resolution; 2) to explore inequality within and between relevant Nepalese administrative levels; and 3) to identify the specific administrative areas in greatest need of policy attention.Methods: We extracted cluster-sample data on the use of the water supply and sanitation that included 10,826 surveyed households from the 2011 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey, then used a Gaussian kernel density estimation with adaptive bandwidths to estimate the distribution of access to improved WSS conditions over a grid at 1 x 1 km. The Gini coefficient was calculated for the measurement of inequality in the distribution of improved WSS; the Theil L measure and Theil T index were applied to account for the decomposition of inequality.Results: 57% of Nepalese had access to improved sanitation (range: 18.1% in Mahottari to 100% in Kathmandu) and 92% to drinking-water (range: 41.7% in Doti to 100% in Bara). The most unequal districts in Gini coefficient among improved sanitation were Saptari, Sindhuli, Banke, Bajura and Achham (range: 0.276 to 0.316); and Sankhuwasabha, Arghakhanchi, Gulmi, Bhojpur, Kathmandu (range: 0.110 to 0.137) among improved drinking-water. Both the Theil L and Theil T showed that within-province inequality was substantially greater than between-province inequality; while within-district inequality was less than between-district inequality.

It emerges that the geographical agglomeration of network firms is significantly related to a lower value of the entropy index, though in this case the network tends to be composed by a small number of firms. In other words, firms can enjoy the positive externalities arising from cooperation when they are located near each other and carry out similar activities; at the same time, the drawbacks of competition are reduced by limiting the number of partners with whom they share their efforts.

Selecting reasonable stratification methods for spatial analysis in specific domains without prior knowledge is challenging because no method is optimal in a general sense. However, a systematic review of a large number of stratification methods is still lacking. In this article, we review the methods for stratification, categorize the existing typical stratification methods into four classes - univariate stratification, cluster-based stratification, multicriteria stratification, and supervised stratification - and construct their taxonomy. Finally, we present a summary of the software and tools used to compare and perform stratification methods.

This paper explained the necessity of validation in the demarcation of eco-geographical regions, which is difficult and may be achieved with some assumptions and presumptions because of the existence of transition zones. Also in this paper, we explored the use of geostatistics in validating regions and boundaries using a case study in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau on the basis of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. The results show that: (1) eco-geographical regions have different spatial complexity and spatial heterogeneity [i.e. different characteristic values (nugget/sill, fractal) of NDVI], and regions with similar patterns of temperature and moisture have similar mean NDVI values and spatial characteristics [i.e. similar spatial characteristic values (nugget/sill, fractal) of NDVI]. Thus, based on the similarity of spatial heterogeneity or spatial patterns of distribution, demarcations of eco-geographical regions with similar conditions of temperature and moisture, such as IID1 (Ngari montane desert-steppe and desert zone), IID2 (Qaidam montane desert zone), and IID3 (Northern slopes of Kunlun montane desert zone), meet the regional validation requirement. (2) Based on the comparison of spatial heterogeneity or spatial patterns of distribution, the boundary between IIA/B1 (Western Sichuan-eastern Xizang montane coniferous forest zone) and IB1 (GologNagqu high-cold shrub-meadow zone) meets the boundary validation requirement. This boundary guarantees high similarities in an intra-region and high differences in inter-regions, because the value of fractal dimension is the minimum in buffer 1. Furthermore, this paper discussed the application of geostatistics in the choice of index system for boundaries of eco-geographical regions and the determination of region size. The results indicate that the application of geostatistics in eco-geographical regional system is broad, and such researches can serve for obtaining more reasonable and applicable eco-geographical regionalization schemes.",Eco-geographical regions,Regional validation,Boundary validation,,,,Geostatistics,Spatial heterogeneity,,,,Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,,,,,,,,,,

An ad hoc index has been built to measure the relevance of geographical labelling as compared to other attributes of a product. Several chosen control factors allowed to explain differences in the relevance of geographical label across studies in terms of characteristics of studies (structural heterogeneity), methodological issues (methodological heterogeneity), and publication processes.Results show that the relevance of geographical label, although not biased by publication selection, is influenced by the structural characteristics of studies and, to a lower extent, by issues related to the publication process.

Stratified ordinary kriging (SOK), which considers the sharp spatial variability of SOC due to natural factors and human activities, is a feasible way to map SOC with high spatial heterogeneity. However, conventional stratified methods are arbitrary and may therefore result in unnecessary and ineffective stratification. In addition, SOK performs poorly when soil properties of some strata present a local trend. In this study, we propose a geographical detector-based stratified regression kriging (GD-SRK) strategy, which aims to guide the stratification, gain strata-dependent knowledges, and improve the performance of stratified kriging. The study area locates in Jianghan Plain, China. The soil and land use types are used as categorical variables, while land use percentages are used as continuous variables. Ordinary kriging (OK), regression kriging (RK), and geographical detector-based stratified ordinary kriging are used as references of GD-SRK. Results indicated that the spatial heterogeneity of SOC was attributed to the differences in soil types and land use types and suggested that the study area should be stratified into four. The spillover effect of land use on the SOC content depended on the strata. Specifically, the SOC in strata II (paddy fields n Fluvisols) and IV (irrigated lands n Fluvisols) was unaffected by land use percentages and was estimated via OK. The SOC in strata I (paddy fields n Anthrosols and Luvisols) and III (irrigated lands n Anthrosols and Luvisols) was negatively correlated with the percentage of irrigated lands. Thus, their estimation of SOC via RK was possible. Using these knowledges, the GD-SRK outperformed the other methods by obtaining highest prediction accuracy and R-2.

We sampled 120 streams across eight regions (stream catchments), spanning a north-south gradient of 12 of latitude, and calculated beta diversity (with both species richness and abundance data) for each region. We explored through a null model if beta diversity deviates from the expectation of stochastic assembly processes and whether the magnitude of the deviation varies geographically. We then performed multimodel inference analysis on the key environmental drivers of beta diversity, using Akaike's information criterion and model and predictor weights to select the best model(s) explaining beta diversity. Beta diversity was, unexpectedly, highest in the South Island. The null model analysis revealed that beta diversity was greater than expected by chance in all eight regions, but the magnitude of beta deviation was higher in the South Island, suggesting differences in environmental filtering and/or dispersal limitation between North and South Island. Habitat heterogeneity was the predominant driver of beta diversity of stream macroinvertebrates, with productivity having a secondary, and negative, contribution. This is one of the first studies accounting for stochastic effects while examining the ecological drivers of beta diversity.

Despite this, it is still gigantic and differs remarkably across districts, while the demographic and socio-economic groups are most affected by it. This paper aimed to decrypt the place-specific spatial dependence and heterogeneity in associations between district-level nutritional status (stunting, wasting and underweight) and its considered correlates using a geocoded database for all 640 Indian districts from the latest fourth wave of the National Family Health Survey, 2015-16. Univariate Moran's I and LISA statistics were used to confirm the spatial clustering and dependence in under-five nutritional status. The Ordinary Least Square (OLS), Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), Spatial (lag/error) models were employed to examine the effects of correlates on the district-level nutritional status. The mean (Moran's I) district-level stunting, wasting and underweight were 38% (0.634), 21% (0.488) and 36% (0.721), respectively. The GWR results disclosed that the spatial heterogeneity in relationships between district-level nutritional status and its driving forces were strongly location-based, altering their direction, magnitude and strength across districts. Overall, the localized model performed better, and best fit the data than the OLS and spatial (lag/error) models. This nationwide study confirmed that the spatial dependencies and heterogeneities in the district-level nutritional status indicators were strongly explained by a multitude of factors and thus can help policymakers in formulating effective nutrition-specific programmatic interventions to speed up the coverage of under-five malnutrition status in most priority districts and geographical hot spots across India.",Under-five,Nutritional status,Spatial heterogeneity,,,,Geographically weighted regression,Indian districts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They might be modified by different cultural backgrounds. This study's aim was to analyse the geographical heterogeneity of doping-related knowledge, beliefs and attitude among adolescent elite athletes. Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: A questionnaire was distributed to athletes participating in the Winter Youth Olympic Games 2020 in Switzerland. Main outcomes ('subjective and actual knowledge', 'beliefs' and 'attitude') were stratified for athletes' region of origin. Geographical heterogeneity was tested with a two-way analysis of variance, and two multiple regression analyses were conducted to assess independent associations of knowledge, age and athletes' geographical region with doping-related beliefs and attitude. Results: 533 athletes (54% females, mean age: 16.0 +/- 1.0 years), completed the questionnaire (response rate: 33%). Actual knowledge was moderate-to-good (9.2 +/- 2.9 correct answers out of 13), and scores of attitude and beliefs showed favourable patterns. Considerable geographical heterogeneity was found for knowledge (p < 0.001), beliefs (p = 0.004) and attitude (p < 0.001). Higher subjective knowledge and actual knowledge were favourably associated with attitude (3 = -0.096, p = 0.049; 3 = -0.316, p < 0.001) and beliefs (3 = 0.120, p = 0.016; 3 = 0.212, p < 0.001), independent of age and geographical region. Conclusions: This study demonstrates considerable geographical heterogeneity of doping-related knowledge, beliefs and attitude, which are three essential target factors of doping prevention in adolescent elite athletes.

Results indicate that patterns of variation for this trait depend on host fruit plantation where lines were collected. In fact, only lines derived from grape' showed phenotypic plasticity for larval olfaction, whereas a genotype*environment interaction was detected solely in lines derived from peach'.

One common approach to analyzing SH involves comparing variances between and within strata to assess the impact of independent variables on the dependent variable. This method, known as spatial stratified heterogeneity (SSH) analysis, is often performed using the geographical detector model. Over time, several optimized versions of geographical detectors have emerged, focusing on discretizing single or dual variables. However, methods for discretizing three or more variables are still limited to the interaction detector, with research on spatial scale effects mainly focused on single factors. To overcome these limitations, an optimal multivariate-stratification geographical detector (OMGD) model has been developed. This model includes two additional modules: factor discretization optimization and scale detector. Fine-tuning factor discretization involves using five univariate and five cluster-based stratification methods to automatically explore the optimal discretization scheme for single factors or multi-factor combinations based on the Geodetector $q$q statistics. The scale detector can then iterate through various spatial scales to identify the optimal spatial scale for SSH analysis. Furthermore, the developed OMGD model has been tested with multiple case datasets to validate its applicability and robustness. The findings demonstrate that the OMGD model can effectively extract the main attributes of single factors and multi-factor combinations, providing a better explanation for geographical phenomena.

Industrialization of natural resources, such as kelp in the marine shallow sublittoral zone through cultivation and wild-harvesting, may lead to extensive translocation and local population decimation. Without adequate resilience in the form of genetic diversity within and across populations and given the potential introduction of deleterious alleles from translocations, such anthropogenically pressured populations may not be able to sufficiently respond to future climate and other stressors. Here we provide an assessment of the genetic heterogeneity of two bioeconomically important kelp species, Laminaria hyperborea and Saccharina latissima, across the Norwegian coastal region from South (57 degrees N) to North (78 degrees N), by applying microsatellite genotyping. Isolation by distance was found for both kelp species when comparing genetic distance to geographic distance. L. hyperborea clustered into four distinct genetic groups corresponding to distinct geographical ecoregions, whereas S. latissima did not show equally strong geographical structuring but separated into three geographical clusters along the Norwegian coast. No genetic differentiation was found within the Norwegian Skagerrak region, corroborating previous findings. The identified genetic clustering of both kelp species supports the retention of established management regions along the Norwegian coast and argues for the continuation of a regional focused management plan for kelp resources.

We show that neglecting the existence of cross-regional effects may lead to misleading conclusions about the long run outcome not only in single regions but also in the entire economy, suggesting that single regions need to coordinate their efforts to achieve disease eradication. We analyze such a coordination by focusing on a control problem in which the social planner determines globally the level of intervention showing that to achieve eradication it is essential to accompany traditional disease control policies (i.e., prevention and treatment) with regulations limiting people's movements. Focusing on COVID-19 we present a calibration based on Italian data showing that, because of the infections generated by cross-regional commuting, even vaccination may not be enough to achieve disease eradication, and limitations on people's movements need to accompany vaccination to preclude COVID-19 from reaching an endemic state.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Row_42,"Zhang, Zehua","Song, Yongze","Wu, Peng",Robust geographical detector,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION,MAY 2022,39,"Geographical detector (GD) is a method to measure spatial associations using a power of determinant (PD) value that compares the variance of data within spatial zones and in the whole study area. Recent studies have implemented GD in diverse fields, such as environmental and socio-economic issues. Spatial data discretization is an essential stage for determining zones using explanatory variables. However, the spatial data discretization process has been sensitive to the GD results. To address this issue, this article proposes a Robust Geographical Detector (RGD) to overcome the limitations of the sensitivity in spatial data discretization and estimate robust PD values of explanatory variables using a B-value. The RGD determines spatial zones with numerical interval breaks using an optimization algorithm of variance-based change point detection. In this study, RGD is implemented in a nationwide case study exploring potential factors of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) density in industrial regions across Australia, where data on both NO2 and potential factors are sourced from satellite images and remote sensing products using Google Earth Engine. Results show that RGD can effectively explore the maximum PD values of spatial associations between response and explanatory variables due to the optimization algorithm-based spatial zones. In addition, RGD-based PD values are generally higher, more robust, and more stable than GD-based PD values since RGD can guarantee the increment of PD values with the increase of interval numbers, which is a challenge in previous GD models. Finally, RGD could provide a more reliable interpretation of PD as RGD finds optimal intervals-based spatial zones determined by potential factors. This study demonstrates that the developed RGD model can provide robust and reliable solutions to explore spatial associations and identify geographical factors.",Robust geographical detector,Optimization of spatial zones,Change point detection,,,,Spatial data discretization,Google Earth Engine,,,,Spatial heterogeneity,,,,,,,,,,

Using the 2012 European Social Survey, the study applies social capital indicators to distinguish between-context and between-individual heterogeneity in three multilevel models of happiness and life satisfaction. Five indicators of social capital at individual and regional level are used to measure the trust, networks and norms dimensions of social capital. Random intercept and random slope hierarchical models are used to control for unexplained regional variability. The possibility of aggregated subjective perceptions conditioning, or interacting with, the effects of individual perceptions is also examined. The results show that the regional means of the social capital indicators are useful in explaining not only average levels of SWB (between-context heterogeneity) but also differences in the importance individuals attribute to their social capital (between-individual heterogeneity). The paper also proposes a research agenda to expand the frontier on contextual effects in the new science of well-being.",Happiness,Life satisfaction,Multilevel models,"Garcia-Aracil, Adela",,,Between-context,Between individual,,,,European regions,,,,,,,,,,

The factors that influence PM2.5 in different regions exhibit significant spatial heterogeneity. Current research has quantified the spatial heterogeneity of single factors but fails to discuss the interactions between factors. In this study, we first divided the study area into subregions based on the spatial heterogeneity of factors in a multi-scale geographically weighted regression model. We then investigated the interactions between different factors in the subregions using the geographical detector model. The results indicate that there was significant spatial heterogeneity in the interactions between the driving factors of PM2.5. The interactions between natural factors have significant uncertainty, as do those between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and socioeconomic factors. The interactions between socioeconomic factors in the subregions were consistent with those in the whole region. Our findings are expected to deepen the understanding of the mechanisms at play among the aforementioned drivers and aid policymakers in adopting unique governance strategies across different regions.",PM2,5 concentrations,spatial heterogeneity,"Wang, Huilin","Wei, Zhenfeng","Han, Yuxing",multi-scale geographically weighted regression,geographical detector model,"Cong, Peitong",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure to environmental carcinogens is unlikely to be evenly distributed geographically, which may give rise to variations in disease occurrence that is detectable in a spatial analysis. The aim of our study was to examine the spatial variation of prostate cancer in Great Britain at ages 45-64 years. Spatial variation was examined across electoral wards from 1975-1991. Poisson regression was used to examine regional, urbanisation and socioeconomic effects, while Bayesian mapping techniques were used to assess spatial variability. There was an indication of geographical differences in prostate cancer risk at a regional level, ranging from 0.83 (95% CI: 0.78-0.87) to 1.2 (95% CI: 1.1-1.3) across regions. There was significant heterogeneity in the risk across wards, although the range of relative risks was narrow. More detailed spatial analyses within 4 regions did not indicate any clear evidence of localised geographical clustering for prostate cancer. The absence of any marked geographical variability at a small-area scale argues against a geographically varying environmental factor operating strongly in the aetiology of prostate cancer.

Some conclusions were drawn. Regional carbon emissions showed significant global and local spatial autocorrelation. The carbon emissions were greater in eastern and northern regions than in western and southern regions. Fixed assets investment and economic output had been the main contributing factors over the study period, and economic output had been decreasing its influence. Industrial structure's influence showed a decrease trend and became smaller in 2015. The results of the interaction detections in 2015 can be divided into two types: enhance and nonlinear, and enhance and bivariate. The interactive influences between technological level and fixed assets investment, economic output and technological level, population size and technological level, and economic output and economic development were greater than others.

To this end, we adopted unique data for PPEM, which was measured based on environmental complaints logged by the telephone hotline set up by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment of China. We observed that PPEM greatly varied from one city to another, indicating significant spatial heterogeneity. In addition, complaints were mainly concentrated in four large regions, namely, the North China Plain, the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, and the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration. Next, a newly developed spatial heterogeneity analysis method, namely, geographical detector, was applied to investigate the driving factors of PPEM. From the factor detector analysis results, we confirmed that the economic level, energy consumption, urban population, college-educated population, wastewater, environmental risk, SO2 emissions, and PM2.5 concentrations were the dominant factors that caused citizens to voice environmental complaints. In addition, we noticed that moderately developed cities were the leading risk areas, which indicated that these cities had serious environmental pollution problems and their citizens actively voiced complaints. As economies continue to grow, the populations in these cities are projected to become more aware of environmental quality and will implement stricter regulations to protect the environment and lower complaints. Moreover, the interaction detector analysis results revealed that the interaction of urban and college-educated populations with other factors played more important roles in affecting PPEM.",Public participation,Environmental management,Environmental protection,"He, Biao",,,Spatial heterogeneity,Geographical detector,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the literature acknowledges this, the geographical patterns in unmet need have not been adequately documented. Spatial analysis of unmet need can reveal differences in usage and provision of contraceptive commodities, thereby pointing to geographical areas where contraceptive programmes should be strengthened. This study examines the geographical variation of the risk of mistimed and unwanted pregnancies between rural communities and also between urban communities of the three ecological zones of Ghana. The study also investigates if geographical differences in the risks of mistimed and unwanted pregnancies changed during the period when unmet need stalled at the national level. A multilevel regression model was applied to pooled data from the 1998 and 2003 Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys to examine the determinants of the risk of unintended pregnancies, while controlling for clustering of outcomes within communities. The results show that between the two surveys, there was no significant change in the levels of risk of mistimed and unwanted pregnancy. However, geographical heterogeneity in the risk of mistimed and unwanted pregnancy was observed, after controlling for relevant predictors. This showed concentration of mistimed pregnancies in some rural communities relative to others, and variation in the risk of unwanted pregnancies between urban communities. The results give a clear indication that bridging the inequality gap in contraceptive use requires programmes that are area-specific.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, fish habitat restoration projects based on geographical morphology have not yet been reported in the Yangtze River. To explore engineering measures used to restore fish habitat structure and function, a mesoscale fish habitat restoration project was designed and constructed, which included restructuring of habitat topography in the fluctuating area. Three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models were used to simulate and predict the project's effect on the hydromorphology prior to construction, and an Acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) was deployed to test and verify actual flow field improvement. Short-term effects on fish species sorting and their main ecological traits were examined. The results showed that vorticity and flow heterogeneity in the river reach increased, suggesting that the restoration projects created flow conditions favourable to indigenous fishes. Thus, pre-optimization using computer simulation is an essential and scientific procedure that could be used to increase the probability of river restoration success. The promotion of habitat diversity had strong effects on fish aggregation, especially for the rare and endemic fish species targeted. Fish abundance, catch biomass and species richness increased by 98.1%, 62.7% and 22.5%, respectively. There were significant differences (p < 0.05) in species number and catch abundance before and after the project. The number of rare and endemic fish species increased from four to nine species. Overall, this research provides evidence that the promotion of habitat hydraulic morphology heterogeneity accelerates the recovery of fish diversity and biomass.",restoration engineering,fish habitat,geographical morphology,"He, Bin","Tian, Changfeng","Zhou, Yin",flow conditions,biodiversity conservation,"Chen, Xiaolong","Zhu, Lin",,Yangtze River ecosystem,,,,,,,,,,
