However, as the user scale continues to expand, the current civil aviation flight scheduling and control methods are becoming inadequate to meet the high-volume flight guarantee demands of future urban air transportation. In order to effectively handle and resolve potential issues in this field in the future, this paper proposes a method for planning urban air mobility route networks. The planning process is divided into two stages: construction and optimization. Methods for constructing urban air mobility route networks based on flight routes and global optimization methods based on node movement are proposed in each stage. In the construction stage, a complete construction process is designed to generate routes based on existing flight routes, in line with the trend of urban air transportation development. In the optimization stage, inspired by the ant colony algorithm, node transfer rules and information transfer rules are incorporated to design a global optimization process and algorithm for route networks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and advancement of the proposed planning method.",urban air mobility,air route network,ant colony algorithm,global optimization algorithm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The traditional truck-based delivery model, characterized by high energy consumption and limited delivery efficiency, is increasingly inadequate for urban express delivery requirements. This study proposes a collaborative delivery route planning model that integrates autonomous vehicles with passenger-freight combined buses to optimize urban express delivery routes, enhance delivery efficiency, and reduce logistics costs. Additionally, a single-parent genetic algorithm was developed for path optimization within this model. This algorithm evaluates delivery route quality by comprehensively considering factors such as delivery time, operational costs, and energy consumption. Finally, a case study conducted in Hanzhong City demonstrates that the collaborative delivery model, compared to the traditional truck-based delivery model, reduces operational costs for courier companies by. 624.75, decreases travel distance by 13.48 kilometers, and increases daily net revenue for bus companies by. 347.2.

However, planning their routes remains a complex task for urban planners. While most studies emphasize either maximizing the number of residents served or enhancing the environmental benefits along these greenways, the role of urban greenways in linking existing facilities like tourist attractions, urban parks, public transport stations, and other greenways has received less attention. This paper introduces an innovative spatial optimization model for the planning of connective urban greenway routes. The model aims to link these facilities while also maximizing the population's access to the greenway. We developed a set of models applicable to different objectives of connecting existing facilities, such as maximizing the number of facilities to be covered, covering all facilities, and minimizing the distance between facilities and planned greenways. Bi-objective scenarios, including weighted and lexicographical models, are also presented. We delineated the MILP formulation of the proposed models.

This study explores the optimization of dynamic vehicle scheduling and real -time route planning in urban public transportation systems, with a focus on bus services. It addresses the limitations of current shared mobility routing algorithms, which are primarily designed for simpler, single origin/destination scenarios, and do not meet the complex demands of bus transit systems.

Air route networks, as a mainstream design scheme for air traffic, are able to provide prerequisites for eVTOL and other green aircraft to enter urban airspace for safe operation, among which air route planning is a fundamental component of air route network design. Currently, most of the research on aircraft path planning is performed in free airspace, lacking the analysis and processing for the complex operation environment, which has led to the high risk and large operation cost of path planning results, failing to meet the demand for safe and efficient development in the future. Aiming at the above problems, eVTOL-oriented air route planning research was carried out. Firstly, the urban low-altitude airspace structure was planned, and the operational levels of eVTOL were clarified; this was followed by introducing the urban dynamic air-ground risk factors and constructing a dynamic risk assessment model containing risk level information; finally, the improved A* algorithm based on the risk cost was employed to plan the eVTOL air route network, which finally realized the purpose of short path length and low total risk. The simulation results showed that the route generated by the improved A* algorithm could reduce the risk cost by at least 30% with a relatively small path cost, which ensured the operation efficiency and safety of eVTOLs and laid the foundation for the further sustainable and green development of urban airspace in the future.",eVTOL,urban air traffic,airspace structure,risk assessment,,path planning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deep reinforcement learning is considered the most effective method for solving urban route planning problems involving large-scale customers and real-time traffic conditions.

To tackle these problems, this study introduces a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning method utilizing an improved transformer model (HDRLITF) based on the divide-and-conquer concept. Graph attention networks and gate mechanisms are integrated into the transformer model to capture dynamic features and improve the model's performance. A two-stage training method, based on the actor-critic algorithm, is proposed to determine the optimal policy function. To evaluate the HDRLITF method, experiments were conducted using datasets from the cities of Shenzhen and Chengdu in China.

The significant burgeoning of ridesharing services in spatial crowdsourcing has transformed urban mobility. However, due to the imbalance between supply and demand, some requests may be rejected or workers may keep idle for a long time. Fortunately, sharing tasks and workers across multiple platforms in a collaborative manner can diminish the negative effects of non-uniform distribution.

This study fills this gap by quantifying the consequences of sprawl on transportation efficiency, proposing an interdisciplinary methodology that integrates knowledge from operations research. Specifically, adopting a broad European perspective, we investigate how urban sprawl correlates with travel distances and optimal routes in 156 spatially heterogeneous cities across 28 European countries. We discover a significant correlation between five sprawl indicators (Land usage, Gini coefficient, Shannon entropy, Moran I index, and Bribiesca index) and both travel distances and routes by car and bicycle: transportation is inherently less efficient in cities with higher levels of sprawl. Among the considered indicators, Shannon entropy emerges as the best predictor of route efficiency. We offer insights into the geography of sprawl in Europe, finding that many Spanish cities stand out for their compactness and route efficiency, while hotspots of sprawl are present in many Western and Central European countries. Our results underline the underestimated importance of addressing urban sprawl to reduce transportation's economic, social, and environmental costs and encourage policymakers and urban planners to prioritize compact city development to foster sustainable urban growth.",Urban sprawl,Routing,Impacts of urban sprawl,Geography of urban sprawl,,City logistics,Traveling salesman problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Coastal areas such as Quarteira and Vilamoura in the Loul & eacute; municipality are especially vulnerable due to their dense population of permanent residents and seasonal tourists, compounded by the long distances required to reach safety zones. Despite the known seismic and tsunami hazards, there have been limited studies that develop tailored mitigation strategies specific to tsunami evacuation. This study contributes to the tsunami science by evaluating potential building damages due to shaking and tsunami impact and providing decision support for evacuation strategies. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), tsunami scenarios are modeled based on historical seismic events, such as the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, to identify high-risk coastal zones and optimize evacuation routes, considering local topography and population density.

However, existing studies primarily focus on route planning for individual tourists, leaving a notable gap in addressing multiple tourists planning scenarios. Traditional methods for multiple tourists planning, derived from single tourist frameworks, often prioritize the interests and benefits of tourists. This has led to problems like popularity-biased route planning, which exacerbates overtourism in favored destinations and under-tourism in lesser-known spots, thereby undermining sustainable tourism. To address these challenges, we introduce a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework specifically designed for multiple tourists route planning, incorporating consideration of tourists' distribution. Our approach consists of two key components: firstly, a novel tourism RL environment that enables interaction with multiple tourists; secondly, a dual-congestion model that considers both local congestion at tourist spots and overall city-wide tourist' distribution. This dual-congestion mechanism formulates the reward system in our multi-agent RL framework. We validate our framework with comprehensive experiments using real-world human mobility data from Kyoto, a globally renowned tourist city. The results show our model's superiority over existing methods in optimizing route rewards and managing tourists' distribution. Additionally, we conducted a user study to examine the effect of our method on tourists' experience, serving as a reference for our future implementation. The findings indicate that our dual-congestion model slightly affects tourists who prefer popular spots. Our discussion highlights the typically non-cooperative relationship between tourism sustainability and tourist self-interest, underscoring the necessity for a trade-off between them in practical applications.

Challenges for urban drivers include finding available parking spaces. Searching for a parking spot can be a frustrating experience, often time consuming and costly. Also, the increasing number of vehicles on the roads leads to an additional strain on traffic flow, while the search for parking spaces lowers the level of service. In inner cities, vehicles circulate in search of an available parking space, leading to an increase in travel time, fuel consumption, pollutant emissions, and a decrease in traffic safety. The search for a free parking space generates a significant increase in traffic in urban areas. To solve the parking search problem, it is necessary to develop certain strategies and measures that minimize circling in search of a parking space. The implementation of intelligent transportation systems stands out. By applying intelligent transport systems, drivers are provided with information about free parking spaces, which reduces the circulation of vehicles in search of free parking. Although initially ITS systems mainly provided services for closed parking lots and garages, with the further development of the system, the service was extended to street parking lots or open-type parking lots. These measures not only solve traffic challenges but also promote sustainability in urban areas. This article analyzes the effect of a cooperative approach of guiding vehicles to available parking spaces compared to a standard model of searching for an available parking space. Within the framework of the advanced model for searching for available space, four parking demand scenarios were defined and simulated. Based on the created traffic simulation, a comparative analysis was made between the classic and cooperative approach, while the primary differences are manifested in the load of the traffic flow A simulation model was developed using the road network from the urban center of Zagreb.",urban sustainability,search for parking,dynamic routing,cooperative approach,,traffic simulations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite their significance, the route selection for these urban greenways often hinges on suitability analysis, which can be influenced by a planner's subjective judgment, thus potentially introducing bias. Spatial optimization is a potential solution for determining optimal urban greenway routes. However, urban greenway route planning poses a distinct spatial optimization challenge that is not addressed by existing models. While urban greenways are inherently linear features, there are generally no specific start or end points dictated in their planning, which contrasts with many existing line-based spatial optimization models. Moreover, the way that coverage for urban greenways is measured-by taking into account the area encompassed within a particular distance from the entire urban greenway-deviates from the method used in conventional coverage optimization models, which works through discrete point-based evaluations. To address these gaps, our study introduces the maximal covering location problem for lines (MCLP-Line) model, which is designed to determine the optimal single-line-shaped urban greenway route with maximum coverage of nearby residents. In this paper, we utilize a line graph data structure to transform the candidate road network into a graph where road segments become nodes and junctions are treated as edges.

Structured routebased UAV operations have been implemented for traffic management of UAVs in support of commercial delivery services in cities. Yet, its essence, multi-path planning with constraints is not well solved in the existing literature. Centralized planning might result in inefficiencies and unfairness in the allocation of precious urban airspace to individual routes. This paper describes a novel distributed route planning method to support UAV operations in a high-density urban environment. The method allows each origin-destination (OD) pair to compete against other OD pairs for an optimized route (e.g. shortest distance), coordinated by a system-level evaluation, leading to a network design that maximizes the performance of not only the individual routes but also the entire system. The core concept is the introduction of congestion pricing, a soft constraint to coordinate the allocation of airspace. The method is tested in standard 2D scenarios and compared with other state-of-the-art methods. The results show that (1) the method is able to generate routes with short individual distances as well as occupying the least airspace by the route network; (2) in some complex scenarios, the method is able to find a solution in a short period of time while other state-of-the-art method fails.

While conventional transportation studies focus on utilitarian decision-making, this research investigates the complex interplay between human-environment interactions and emotional attachments to places, which influence transportation choices. Specifically, we examine the impact of sense of place in pedestrian route choice within a densely populated urban university community. Unlike typical urban settings characterized by clear roads and landmarks, university environments often feature intricate layouts with diffuse pathways, shared spaces, and a lack of clear spatial hierarchies. This complexity challenges conventional spatial knowledge acquisition methods. Individuals navigating such environments tend to rely on socio-sensory wayfinding strategies, developing emotional connections to specific places and routes over time. Consequently, route choices in these contexts may not always be deliberate but rather subconscious and nuanced. Our study focuses on elucidating the impact of the sense of place-a composite of conscious and subconscious perceptions, emotions, and attachments to a location-on daily route decisions. Through structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis, we demonstrate that the sense of place significantly influences route choices within community building complexes, surpassing utilitarian considerations as a primary explanatory factor. These findings underscore the importance of emotional and psychological factors in shaping urban route decisions, offering valuable insights for urban planning and management strategies.",Pedestrian route choice,Sense of place,Place identity,Place attachment,,University community,Mobility practices,,Structural equation modeling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper presents the development methodology of an evolutionary-based optimization framework designed to tackle a specific formulation of a Drone Delivery Problem (DDP) with charging hubs. The proposed evolutionary-based optimization framework is based on a double-chromosome task encoding logic. The goal of the algorithm is to find optimal (and feasible) UAV task assignments such that (i) the tasks' due dates are met, (ii) an energy consumption model is minimized, (iii) re-charge tasks are allocated to ensure service persistency, (iv) risk-aware flyable paths are included in the paradigm. Hard and soft constraints are defined such that the optimizer can also tackle very demanding instances of the DDP, such as tens of package delivery tasks with random temporal deadlines.Simulation results show how the algorithm's development methodology influences the capability of the UAVs to be assigned to different tasks with different temporal constraints.

The booming tourism industry during the past decades has triggered significant expansion in its urban land area, resulting in a large number of newly-built residential communities appearing on unplanned land. In this study, we used multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR)-based hedonic price analysis to investigate 4624 housing transactions from 524 residential communities in Chiang Mai. This showed that the recent land-use planning in Chiang Mai has had unusual effects on housing prices; specifically, the effects of accessibility to hospitals, primary and secondary schools, green parks, and shopping malls could be ignored, demonstrating that local residents were well satisfied with land-use planning for high-quality medical and education sources and good living environments throughout the whole of Chiang Mai, and that no more land-use planning and investment on these facilities was needed. However, limited bus routes were only used for tourism and could not provide convenient routes for local residents, leading to their negative effects on housing prices in downtown areas, so the local government should lower the bus stop density in downtown areas and strengthen the transportation links between downtown areas and suburbs.

A slack arrival strategy, which relaxes the schedule constraints of a checkpoint but does not affect the bus operating cycle, is proposed to deal with the real-time demand insertion (RDI) problem in FRFT. A dynamic optimization model that is based on slack arrival strategy, which considers penalty time costs, is established to solve rejection decisions and route modification problems in RDI. Then, a method for a multimodal feeder plan is proposed, where FRFT is set for the growing number of commuters and factories, and fixed-route transit is set for mature communities with large passenger demand. A bilevel programming model is built, in which the upper-level multimodal feeder plan model is constructed by comprehensively considering the total travel cost of passengers and the bus profit (ticket income minus operational cost). The lower level is a multimode traffic assignment model. A genetic algorithm (GA) is adopted in the concrete optimization solution. The proposed method is validated through a sample application to Tianjin City, China. Compared with the method without public transit (PT) routes, the method with fixed routes, and the method with conventional flex-route transit in growing communities and factories, the total travel cost is reduced by 9.14%, 5.65%, and 3.86%, respectively. The bus profit increased by 34.67%, 56.89%, and 38.68%, respectively. In addition, the effectiveness of policies for FRFT is verified by evaluating the performance of a multimodal feeder plan under various advanced reservation rates.

In this paper, an improved bureau of public roads-Q learning (IBPR-QL) control model considering real-time road traffic information is proposed for route planning of connected vehicles in cooperative vehicle-road scenarios. Firstly, the improved bureau of public roads (IBPR) function is enhanced through the utilization of speed state staging methodology, enabling adaptive adjustment of road priorities across different speed scenarios. Secondly, the IBPR function is incorporated into the Q-learning (QL) action value evaluation process to enhance model learning efficiency. Thirdly, predictive travel coefficient is proposed to mitigate congestion drift-induced oscillation phenomenon in road networks and enhance overall travel efficiency. Finally, road network datasets from four economically developed cities in China are utilized to construct a simulated road scene. The simulation results indicate that, compared to the classical QL method, IBPR-QL has a wider range of applicability across scenarios, effectively reducing travel time by 7.96%.

People, when walking in particular, are at risk of experiencing heat stress as they navigate urban environments. This study proposes a novel heat risk assessment framework combining pedestrian mobility modeling with urban microclimate modeling. Using this framework, we assessed pedestrian heat-related exposure and risk in urban areas by integrating the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) as the hazard and pedestrian trips to critical destinations as exposure. We considered temporal variation, in both hazard and exposure, by examining different time periods during the day-morning peak, midday, and evening peak. In addition to hazard and exposure, we also considered vulnerability by focusing on young children and older adults. We contribute to improving the spatial resolution of heat risk assessment by analyzing the hazard for pedestrian trips between home locations and five critical destinations-bus stops, rail stations, parks, schools, and commercial amenities-at the address-point level and using a pedestrian network comprising sidewalks and crosswalks. Our framework helps identify sidewalks with high heat exposure levels as well as home locations with high cumulative heat risk, accounting for walking trips to critical destinations along feasible routes. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this framework by applying it to a 36-square-kilometer area of central Los Angeles, CA. Our findings offer valuable information to urban planners and policy-makers, supporting evidence-based prioritization of intervention sites, climate adaptation strategies, and policy decisions essential for climate-proof planning. By implementing targeted interventions in areas where heat hazard is expected to affect the most vulnerable pedestrians, planners can create heat-resilient, pedestrian-friendly environments while prioritizing the health and well-being of vulnerable groups.

Unlike in a free-flow road network, the consideration set for route choice decisions in a URT network does not depend purely on the physical connectivity of the network and decision makers'characteristics. Instead, it is also contingent on the train schedules. This paper delves into the evolution of research on route choices in URT networks, encompassing both probabilistic route choice modelling derived from utility maximisation theory and logit curve with physical connectivity, and retrospective route choice modelling based on travel time chaining along with comprehensive transport data.

The latter incorporates dynamic temporal information to understand activities of passengers in URT networks. Enhancements of each genres are also examined.

This study utilizes an initial dataset to conduct an analysis and introduces an improved Generalized Random Regret Minimization model (GRRM) aimed at understanding passengers' route choice adjustments in response to COVID-19 guidance information. This improved GRRM accounts for two decision-making criteria, namely, maximum utility and minimum regret, and considers passenger heterogeneity. This marks the first instance of capturing the heterogeneity shift effect in route choice perception during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The application of our approach to urban street networks, Barabasi-Albert scale-free network and Erdos-Renyi random network demonstrates that if all travelers choose optimal paths constraint with time from the start, network throughput is insensitive to the continuous optimization behavior but depends on the relationship between time and distance in the routing algorithm. Besides, network throughput is sensitive to the hybrid optimization behavior that the more travelers choose time-dependent optimal paths, the higher the throughput. The results indicate that the choice of initial paths and the time dependence of routing algorithms can directly affect the network's actual throughput which is enhanced >50 % when the time dependence parameter is >0.2 or the proportion of time-dependent shortest paths in initial paths is >0.2. Our findings provide supports for exploring efficient routing algorithms to enhance the throughput of urban street networks and other kinds of networks.",Route planning,Congestion,Traffic flow,Network throughput,,,,"Fan, Qinjin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on our experience developing and deploying the Cycle Route Uptake and Scenario Estimation (CRUSE) Tool for Ireland, we outline the underlying methods, including disaggregation of origin-destination data with the open source 'odjitter' software, incorporation of additional trip purposes, routing, scenario generation, and development of an intuitive user interface that is tested and used by practitioners. Commissioned by the national infrastructure agency Transport Infrastructure Ireland, CRUSE provides estimates of current and potential future cycling levels under 'snapshot' scenarios to inform investment decisions. The publicly available results at https://cruse.bike/ enable planners, engineers, and other stakeholders to make more evidence-based decisions. CRUSE goes beyond previous work by: modeling networks at high spatial resolution; simulating multiple trip purposes (social, shopping, personal utility, recreational, and cycle touring), supplementing official origin-destination datasets on travel for work and education; and providing estimates of 'quietness' (a proxy for cyclist comfort and route preference) at the route segment level. Three network types-'Fastest', 'Balanced', and 'Quietest'-help plan both arterial and residential cycle networks. Workshops with stakeholders were used to inform the development of the tool. Feedback shows that the tool has a wide range of uses and is already being used in practice to inform urban, inter-urban, and rural cycle network designs.

In this approach, the entire trip is associated with a complex network or graph, where the nodes and edges correspond to potential trajectory segments. Utilizing the information collected from a bike-sharing system, the cost attributed to each segment is determined using the multinomial logistic regression (MLR) technique by analyzing its usage frequency and other user preferences. Consequently, segments with high usage and strong preferences entail lower costs, whereas those with limited use and weaker predilection assume higher costs. After assigning costs to all segments within the network, the subsequent step involves generating the trajectory with the lowest accumulated cost. Unlike other approaches, our method considers realistic conditions and user preferences without inconsistencies imposed by the techniques based on surveys. To validate the performance of the proposed method, a set of extensive experiments and case studies were conducted considering the urban model from downtown Guadalajara, Mexico. As a result, this approach improves the efficiency of the bike trajectory planning system by providing shorter and safer routes for both cyclists and motor vehicle drivers.The proposed bicycle trajectory planning methodology, grounded in multinomial logistic regression, unfolds various practical applications. Beyond conventional distance-centric models, our approach, driven by user-generated data from bike-sharing systems, crafts tailored routes prioritizing safety and convenience. This breakthrough optimizes trajectories and strategically targets new cyclist adoption, fostering sustainable biking cultures. Successfully validated in the urban model of Guadalajara, Mexico, our methodology equips urban planners and policymakers with a powerful tool for designing trajectories that are not only shorter but also safer.

After a series of experiments, it was found that the software presents several inconsistencies with logistical and operational management concepts, such as the unnecessary realization of U-turns in a dead end and unnecessary access to areas with difficult access to a single customer. These are issues that a collection route planner must consider to make a good decision that considers the cost of visiting areas with difficult access and the benefits of reaching that area. In this sense, our heuristic procedure considers a set of best practices in operational and logistical strategies that could be programmed within the Network Analyst. As it is well known in the science of vehicle routing, U-turns and sub-tours in the routes travelled by vehicles increase distances and operating costs, so in our work, we propose a systematic heuristic procedure to reduce the number of U-turns performed by a municipal waste collection truck, while using the ArcGIS-Network Analyst add-on to reduce the number of sub-tours in the route under the Directed-Capacitated Arc Routing Problem approach. It is then shown how the routes improved using our conceptual heuristic procedure, which provides better quality than the original routes obtained with ArcGIS and Network Analyst.

However, achieving effective strike performance in complex urban environments remains challenging, particularly when considering three-dimensional obstacles and threat zones simultaneously, which can significantly degrade strike effectiveness. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a target strike strategy using the Electric Eel Foraging Optimization (EEFO) algorithm, a heuristic optimization method designed to ensure precise strikes in complex environments. The problem is formulated with specific constraints, modeling each UAV as an electric eel with random initial positions and velocities. This algorithm simulates the interaction, resting, hunting, and migrating behaviors of electric eels during their foraging process. During the interaction phase, UAVs engage in global exploration through communication and environmental sensing. The resting phase allows UAVs to temporarily hold their positions, preventing premature convergence to local optima. In the hunting phase, the swarm identifies and pursues optimal paths, while in the migration phase the UAVs transition to target areas, avoiding threats and obstacles while seeking safer routes. The algorithm enhances overall optimization capabilities by sharing information among surrounding individuals and promoting group cooperation, effectively planning flight paths and avoiding obstacles for precise strikes. The MATLAB(R2024b) simulation platform is used to compare the performance of five optimization algorithms-SO, SCA, WOA, MFO, and HHO-against the proposed Electric Eel Foraging Optimization (EEFO) algorithm for UAV swarm target strike missions. The experimental results demonstrate that in a sparse undefended environment, EEFO outperforms the other algorithms in terms of trajectory planning efficiency, stability, and minimal trajectory costs while also exhibiting faster convergence rates. In densely defended environments, EEFO not only achieves the optimal target strike trajectory but also shows superior performance in terms of convergence trends and trajectory cost reduction, along with the highest mission completion rate. These results highlight the effectiveness of EEFO in both sparse and complex defended scenarios, making it a promising approach for UAV swarm operations in dynamic urban environments.",urban environment,UAV swarms,target strike,trajectory planning,,electric eel foraging optimization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In view of this, we formulated a heat stress-avoidant routing approach in Heidelberg, Germany, to ensure mobility and support day-to-day activities in urban areas during heat events. Although the primary focus is on pedestrians, it is also applicable to cyclists. To obtain a nuanced understanding of the needs and demands of the wider population, especially vulnerable groups, and to address the challenge of reducing urban heat stress, we used an inter- and transdisciplinary approach. The needs of vulnerable groups, the public, and the city administration were identified through participatory methods and various tools, including interactive city walks. Solution approaches and adaptation measures to prevent heat stress were evaluated and integrated into the development of a heat-avoiding route service through a co-design process. The findings comprise the identification of perceived hotspots for heat (such as large public spaces in the city centre with low shading levels), the determination of commonly reported symptoms resulting from severe heat (e.g., fatigue or lack of concentration), and the assessment of heat adaptation measures that were rated positively, including remaining in the shade and delaying errands. Additionally, we analysed and distinguished between individual and community adaptation strategies. Overall, many respondents did not accurately perceive the risk of heat stress in hot weather, despite severe limitations. As a result, the heat-sensitive routing service (available in prototype form during publication) that has been created serves as a readily available and accessible source of assistance to combat the effects of heat stress in individuals' daily lives during periods of intense heat. The findings served as input for the calibration of heat stress-avoidant routing and supported the development of local heat protection plans without investing in large-scale adaptation of the built environment.

One of the fundamental challenges in URT demand management is the dynamic interaction between train frequencies and passenger routing behaviors, which becomes even more complicated in oversaturated scenarios. Introducing the behavior-adaptive sync-flow (BASF) framework, this study holistically addresses the tactical frequency settings (train flows) for URT networks and the responsive route choice behaviors of passengers (passenger flows). The proposed integrated model incorporates a schedule-based passenger assignment within space - time networks to model passengers ' routing behaviors based on time-dependent route travel costs. In addition to travel time, the often-overlooked factors such as in-train congestion, number of passengers being left behind, and number of transfers are considered as components influencing travel costs and, consequently, routing behaviors at an individual level. A gradient descent-based heuristic iterative solution approach is developed to address the integrated model by dividing it into three subproblems. In this iterative process, passengers respond according to a logit-based route choice model based on time-dependent route travel costs, while frequencies are updated using a gradient descent-based strategy. Central to the proposed BASF framework are the mutual adaptations between URT line frequencies and passenger route choices.

Under the perspective of transit-oriented development, the planning area of integrated transport hub faces the problem of high-intensity construction. In response to these issues, current research lacks sufficient exploration of station area development, and there is a lack of integration between bus routing and multi-objective coordination. In order to control the construction intensity of the integrated transport hub, the study constructs a system dynamics model to analyze the relationship between the planning of the integrated transport hub and the urban land use as well as the interaction of the interests of multiple subjects. Based on the relationship analysis, the study constructs a single-objective and multi-objective optimization model oriented to the regulation of development intensity, and used the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution to solve the model. The results indicated that the attractiveness of the site area of the integrated transport hub, the passenger flow and the land financial income would enhance the development intensity of the land. The conflicting interests between different subjects were focused on economy and environment. After multi-objective optimization, the corresponding values of economic benefit, residential environment, mixed land use, and traffic flow service were 3 billion yuan+, 6.51, 41867.44m2, and 346291.24, respectively.

With historical GPS data as inputs, bunching occurrences are identified using the spatiotemporal-density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (ST-DBSCAN) algorithm. To determine the impact of bunching on various bus stops, k-means++ clustering was used on top of ST-DBSCAN, and subsequently, spatiotemporal bunching patterns were investigated. Some bus stops are consecutively impacted by bunching; however, others are impacted in an isolated manner. To capture the spatiotemporal propagation of bunching, a new indicator termed the propagation ratio is proposed, which could classify the bunching as propagating or isolated. Bunching occurrences are propagating for some bus routes and isolated for others, which justifies the need to prioritize routes displaying propagating nature. Of interest, bunching is identified on high and low-frequency bus routes, which indicates the need to relook at the operational planning of all the bus routes regardless of their frequency. At times, excessive bunching is detected during lean periods of the day, which suggests the necessity of modifying the dispatching headways that are based on passenger demand during these lean periods. The outcomes from this work further indicate that all the bus stops along a bus route are not equally impacted by bunching. The spatiotemporal cluster plots could successfully capture the initial bunching occurrence points and their variation with time, which could provide an opportunity for the operators to apply time-varying remedial measures. The insights developed from this work could be used advantageously by operators and policymakers for mitigating bus bunching and improving the urban bus service.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, this study seeks through the science tree metaphor and PRISMA methodology, to find studies focused on the vehicle routing problem in waste collection operations, considering aspects such as Modeling approaches and solution techniques, applied Vehicle Routing Problems variants, objective functions, decision variables and constraints, applications in real environments, applied algorithms, and studies considering uncertainty and real conditions. A methodological outline of Vehicle Routing Problems in waste collection operations is presented, where central research topics are identified such as processes developed with Geographic Information System and their integration with exact methods, time windows, multi-objective capacitated vehicle routing problems, the application of stochastic models consider the uncertainty in waste collection, which has allowed including future prediction and optimization as prediction models, based on neural networks, to foresee uncertain conditions of the operations. This article analyzes the evolution in the optimization of municipal solid waste collection routes since 1964, highlighting the transition from iterative models to advanced technologies and multi-objective approaches. The importance of tools such as 3D Geographic Information System and heuristic/metaheuristic algorithms in improving planning and efficiency, despite limitations in the face of uncertainty, is emphasized. The systematic review shows a trend towards sustainable and efficient solutions, indicating future directions for research in urban waste management.",Waste collection routing,problem,Vehicle routing problem,Solid waste,,Residential waste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pedestrians are exposed to high levels of heat stress on hot days, which may reduce their willingness to walk. It is thus important to understand how heat affects pedestrian behavior and accessibility, so that climate mitigation strategies can be better targeted to support walking as a mode of transport but also as a first-/last-mile connection to public transit. In this study, we used a dataset of pedestrian trips undertaken during the summer of 2014 in Boston, MA. Along with several route attributes (such as length, turns, sidewalk width, amenities, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and Sky View Factor), we also included a measure of heat stress (Universal Thermal Climate Index - UTCI) to explain pedestrian route choice behavior. Using path-size logistic regression models, we found evidence to suggest that heat stress has a considerable and statistically significant effect on the perceived walking distance. We also found that the effect was non-uniform and possibly exponential. Additionally, we illustrated the extent to which heat stress can reduce pedestrian accessibility to important destinations (such as public transit). This reduction was significant on a typical summer day, with an even sharper reduction on the hottest summer day. Non-White residents were observed to have lower accessibility levels compared to all pedestrians, likely because of disparities in urban heat exposure. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating heat exposure into transportation planning and urban design frameworks, especially with an equity lens to address unequal consequences.",Heat stress,Thermal comfort,Willingness to walk,Pedestrian route choice,,Accessibility,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike past statedominated urban redevelopment, current market-oriented redevelopment activities are becoming more active, while the government continues to play an important role through various forms of intervention. To optimise the development of urban space, a comprehensive understanding of the effect of government interventions on the spatial variations of market-oriented redevelopment activities is required. Against the background of Shenzhen's market-oriented urban village redevelopment, this study formulated a theoretical framework to identify the core government interventions in terms of urban planning, development intensity control, and decentralisation, and then analysed how they affect the market-oriented redevelopment activities from a spatial perspective. Ordinary least squares regression and geographically weighted regression models were employed to conduct an empirical analysis to measure the specific impact of diverse government interventions. The results show that the planned transport routes, public facilities, and density zones can effectively guide the urban village redevelopment projects towards the future core development areas of a city. The introduction and implementation of Shenzhen's decentralisation of urban redevelopment have promoted urban village redevelopment and have resulted in significant differences in redevelopment activities dominated by market forces across administrative districts.

Unlike motorized transportation, primarily influenced by the built environment of the origin and destination, pedestrian route choices are also shaped by individual characteristics. Traditional route choice models often employ multi-segment training based on these characteristics, limiting their ability to capture heterogeneity among pedestrians within a unified framework. Additionally, these models frequently rely on oversimplified utility assumptions and neglect the implications of Markov decision sequences, potentially resulting in a misinterpretation of genuine route choice preferences. Addressing these, we introduce the Maximum-Entropy Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Individual Covariates (MEDIRL-IC) framework, which accounts for the stochastic nature of state transitions in Markov decision process. Building on MaxEnt-IRL, MEDIRL-IC uses deep neural networks to separately fit constant individual features and dynamic built environment features before integration, effectively capturing the non-linear reward function in pedestrian scenarios. We further enrich model interpretability using a graph-based causal discovery algorithm, offering insights into complex feature interactions. Validations on a pedestrian mobile signaling dataset affirm MEDIRL-IC's superior balance between model fit and interpretability.

Emergency medical services (EMS) routing and direct transport of acute stroke patients to stroke centers improves timely access to care. This study aimed to describe EMS stroke routing and transports by rurality in North Carolina (NC).MethodsWe conducted a retrospective study using existing data on EMS transports of suspected stroke patients in NC in 2019. The primary study outcome was EMS bypass of the nearest hospital for transport to a nonnearest hospital, determined by geographic information systems (GIS) analysis. Incident addresses were geocoded to census tracts and classified as urban, suburban, or rural by Rural-Urban Commuting Area codes. We compared the frequency of bypass and estimated additional transport times by urban, suburban, and rural incident locations.FindingsOf 3666 patients, 1884 (51%) EMS transports bypassed the nearest hospital. Bypass occurred less often for rural EMS incidents (39%) compared to those in urban (57%) and suburban (63%) tracts. The estimated additional transport time for rural bypasses of nonendovascular-capable stroke centers for endovascular-capable stroke centers was a median of 25 min (interquartile range 13-33).ConclusionsUsing GIS analysis, we found nearly half of EMS transports of suspected stroke patients in NC bypassed the nearest hospital, including noncertified hospitals and stroke centers. Bypasses occurred less often in rural areas, though incurred significantly longer transport times, compared to urban areas.

In this study, we address the problem of jointly scheduling and routing SAVs across an urban network with the possibility of platooning the vehicles at intersections to reduce their travel time. We argue that this is especially useful in large urban areas. We introduce a novel vehicle scheduling and routing method that allows a specific number of SAVs to converge at the intersections of urban corridors within designated time intervals, facilitating the formation of SAV platoons. Dedicated lanes and signal priority control are activated to ensure that these platoons go through the corridors efficiently. Based on the above concept, we propose a linear integer programming model to minimize the total travel time of SAVs and the delays experienced by the conventional vehicles due to SAV priority, thereby optimizing the overall performance of the road network. For large instances, we develop a two-stage heuristic algorithm to solve it faster. In the first stage, leveraging an evaluation index that manifests the compatibility of each vehicle-torequest combination, we allocate passenger requests to a fleet of SAVs. In the second stage, a customized genetic algorithm is designed to coordinate the paths of various SAVs, thus achieving the desired vehicle platooning effect. The optimization method is tested on a real-world road network in Shanghai, China. The results display a remarkable reduction of 15.76 % in the total travel time of the SAVs that formed platoons. The overall performance of the road network could be improved with the total travel time increase of conventional vehicles significantly smaller than the reduction observed in SAVs' total travel time.",Shared autonomous vehicles,Vehicle platooning,Traffic priority,Vehicle scheduling and routing,,Two-stage algorithm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on an analytic model of the vehicle energy consumption and a given road graph, a special A*-search algorithm is proposed to find the route that minimizes a weighted time-energy cost. For each road section, the proposed approach finds the solution to an optimal control problem constrained by traffic rules, road curvature and physical limits of the vehicle. This allows the method to be used with basic, widely available knowledge of the road network (road layout, infrastructure and speed limits). No learned or statistic traffic-related data like average speed or vehicle density is needed. Special attention is given to the effects of acceleration/braking profiles along the trajectory and to the energy-regenerating capacities of the electric vehicle, as we show they are major sources of energy consumption. Results show that our approach saves on average 53.3% on energy consumption compared to the fastest (safe and legal) driving, with only 6.8% longer travel time. It is also able to find routes that are on average 2.1% better than the shortest route when both routes are driven with optimal eco-driving. Our approach considers more energy-saving driving compared to other state-of-the-art techniques, mainly by featuring coasting. Thanks to a simple reformulation of the eco-routing cost, we propose the first informed graph search method for the eco-routing of vehicles with regenerative capabilities. We show on a practical example that this informed graph search saves can divide by 5 how much of the graph needs to be explored.",,,,,,,,"Khenfri, Fouad",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In response, we introduce the DELTA dataset, designed to improve the analysis and mapping of pedestrian zones, thereby filling the critical need for sidewalk-centric multimodal datasets. The DELTA dataset was collected in a single urban setting using a custom-designed modular multi-sensing e-scooter platform encompassing high-resolution and synchronized audio, visual, LiDAR, and GNSS/IMU data.

The selection of high-potential trees to capture air pollutants provides an attractive route for the mitigation of urban smog. The current study explored the air purification potential of the four most abundant trees, i.e., white mulberry (Morus alba L.), plane tree (Platanus orientalis L.), European ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.), and Tehran pine (Pinus eldarica Ten.)], as phytoremediators grown in three parks located in regions with low, moderate, and high levels of air pollution in Tehran on the mitigation of four urban hazardous gases (O3, NO2, CO, and SO2) and in altering the content of respiratory gases (CO2 and O2). The measurement of gas levels was carried out in September-October, from 1.30 to 1.50 m above the ground. The concentration of gases was measured by an ambient gas assessment device (Aeroqual). Broad-leaf deciduous species had a greater ability to mitigate O3, NO2, CO, CO2, and SO2 concentrations than needle-leaf evergreen species.

In many Chinese cities, the planning of rail transit routes and stations is focused on facilitating new developments rather than revitalizing existing built-up areas. This approach reflects the local governments' expectations of substantial growth to reshape the urban structure. However, existing research on transit-oriented development (TOD) rarely explores the spatial interactions between individual transit stations and investigates how they can be integrated to achieve synergistic effects and balanced development. This study proposes that rail transit systems impact urban structure through two ""forces"": the provision of additional and reliable carrying capacity and the reduction of travel time between locations. Metro passenger flow is used as a proxy for these forces, and community detection techniques are employed to identify the actual and optimal spatial clusters in Wuhan, China. The results reveal that the planned sub-centers align reasonably well with the optimal spatial clusters in terms of spatial configuration. However, the actual spatial clusters tend to have longer internal travel times compared to the optimal clusters. Further exploration suggests the need for equalizing land use density within planned spatial clusters served by the metro system.

These networks are deeply intertwined with urban traffic systems, where variations in transit speeds can significantly increase the energy consumption and carbon emissions of delivery vehicles, compromising the environmental sustainability of urban deliveries. To address this, we propose a multidepot time-dependent vehicle routing problem with time windows, enhancing route planning flexibility and resource configuration. Our approach begins with a route spatiotemporal decomposition method to estimate vehicle travel times and emissions based on varying vehicle speeds. We then develop a multiobjective mixed integer linear programming model that aims to minimize total operating costs, the number of vehicles, and carbon dioxide emissions. A hybrid heuristic algorithm combining spectral clustering, multiobjective ant colony optimization, and variable neighborhood search is proposed to solve the model. This algorithm incorporates collaboration and resource sharing strategies, a pheromone initialization mechanism, a novel heuristic operator that accounts for time dependency, and a self-adaptive update mechanism, enhancing both solution quality and algorithm convergence. We compare the performance of our algorithm with that of the CPLEX solver, multiobjective ant colony optimization, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III, and multiobjective particle swarm optimization. The results demonstrate the superior convergence, uniformity, and spread of our proposed algorithm. Furthermore, we apply our model and algorithm to a real-world case in Chongqing, China, analyzing optimized results for different time intervals and vehicle speeds.

This involved a comprehensive assessment that encompassed the judicious selection of sites for both stations and blood centers, coupled with the meticulous planning of delivery routes for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that orchestrate the transportation of blood. First, a model was formulated to minimize the overall cost, including transportation expenses, costs associated with the site, and other relevant costs related to blood transportation vehicles coordinated by UAVs. Subsequently, a two-stage hybrid heuristic algorithm was designed based on the distinctive characteristics of the problem at hand. Moreover, an enhanced k-means algorithm was employed to generate clustering schemes, utilizing the centroid method to address the challenge of location selection for delivery sites effectively. A genetic algorithm enhanced with adaptive operators was employed to address the challenging large-scale NP-hard problem associated with route planning in intricate urban road networks. The results indicated that, compared to the traditional blood delivery model using vehicles, the total blood transportation cost decreased by 12.65% and the overall delivery time was reduced by 37.5% with the adoption of drone-assisted delivery; ultimately, case and sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate the impact of variables including the number of blood transportation vehicles, UAVs, driver wages, and unit costs of blood transportation vehicles on the location-routing problem.",Intricate networks,Two-stage hybrid heuristic algorithm,Location of distribution site,Vehicle-UAV routing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ensuring that urban and suburban neighborhoods remain liveable and comfortable to reside in is a challenge amidst growing urbanization. Neighborhood quality has been associated with socio-demographic, dwelling-related, and subjective and objective neighborhood factors. However, only a few studies have additionally included participation in neighborhood decision-making and examined whether these associations are stronger among residents who are more settled in the neighborhood. We examined whether subjectively and objectively measured environmental factors and participation are associated with perception of neighborhood liveability and possible effect moderators. We analyzed survey data collected in 2021 among adults (aged 18-97) living in suburbs and urban centers in five Finnish cities (n = 2057; response rate 34%) with logistic regression models. Almost 80% of the respondents perceived their neighborhood as liveable or very liveable.

Only a few interactions between indicators of being more settled in the neighborhood (e.g., age group and dwelling ownership) modified these associations.

The food delivery riders, as a rapidly expanding outdoor working occupation, face more serious threats from the exposure of urban heat extremes due to the nature of work, particularly during peak ordering hours in midday. Nevertheless, research specifically targeting the heat exposure risks of the food delivery occupation remains scant. Taking a bustling commercial area in Nanjing (China) as an example, this study aims to systematically evaluate the spatial and temporal distribution of heat exposure in urban streets to quantify the heat exposure risk for delivery riders. The SOLWEIG (Solar and Longwave Environmental Irradiance Geometry) model was used to simulate the Mean Radiant Temperature (Tmrt), and GPS data to assess the transient and cumulative heat stress experienced by individual delivery riders. Results show that factors like shading, street type, and orientation significantly impact the thermal environment of urban streets. Heat mitigation strategies include enhancing shading with building and tree covers (resulting in an average reduction of 10.6 to 21.1 degrees C in Tmrt), increasing the proportion of north-south routes (in the northern hemisphere), and integrating alternative delivery routes. These measures can improve transient heat stress by 15.5% and cumulative heat stress by 13.2% for food delivery riders. Moreover, comprehensive coping strategies are proposed from multiple perspectives (i.e., urban planning, platform management, and individuals) to minimize the individual heat exposure and corresponding traffic accidents for the food delivery occupation, which further promotes the sustainable development of the urban environment, transportation and delivery industry.",Heat exposure,Food delivery riders,Urban streets,Urban environment,,,,"Cao, Shi-jie",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To calculate the least-cost paths and safer, more efficient routes, it is necessary to understand the geometry of streets and their various elements accurately. In this study, we propose a semi-automatic methodology to assess the capacity of urban spaces to enable adequate pedestrian mobility. We employ various data sources, but primarily point clouds obtained through a mobile laser scanner (MLS), which provide a wealth of highly detailed information about the geometry of street elements. Our method allows us to characterize preferred pedestrian-traffic zones by segmenting crosswalks, delineating sidewalks, and identifying obstacles and impediments to walking in urban routes. Subsequently, we generate different displacement cost surfaces and identify the least-cost origin-destination paths. All these factors enable a detailed pedestrian mobility analysis, yielding results on a raster with a ground sampling distance (GSD) of 10 cm/pix. The method is validated through its application in a case study analyzing pedestrian mobility around an educational center in a purely urban area of A Coru & ntilde;a (Galicia, Spain). The segmentation model successfully identified all pedestrian crossings in the study area without false positives. Additionally, obstacle segmentation effectively identified urban elements and parked vehicles, providing crucial information to generate precise friction surfaces reflecting real environmental conditions. Furthermore, the generation of cumulative displacement cost surfaces allowed for identifying optimal routes for pedestrian movement, considering the presence of obstacles and the availability of traversable spaces. These surfaces provided a detailed representation of pedestrian mobility, highlighting significant variations in travel times, especially in areas with high obstacle density, where differences of up to 15% were observed. These results underscore the importance of considering obstacles' existence and location when planning pedestrian routes, which can significantly influence travel times and route selection. We consider the capability to generate accurate cumulative cost surfaces to be a significant advantage, as it enables urban planners and local authorities to make informed decisions regarding the improvement of pedestrian infrastructure.",pedestrian,pedestrian mobility,school mobility,school route,,urban mobility,walkability,,pedestrian path,,least-cost path,cumulative cost,,,,,,,,,,,,

A crucial strategy to address this challenge is through risk assessment and mitigation of flight routes that consider the stochastic nature of urban populations. Traditional strategies treat drone flight route approval and execution independently, which fall short in such a dynamic risk environment where plans deemed safe at the strategic approval stage may later prove hazardous, and vice versa. To address these intricacies, this paper introduces a novel two-stage stochastic optimization model that integrates strategic route feasibility assessment with tactical route selection and timing adjustments. A unique aspect of our model is the implementation of a risk penalty that effectively bridges decisions between the two stages, thereby reducing the likelihood of decision errors caused by stochastic variations. Through extensive simulations within Singapore's urban context, our model demonstrates a risk reduction by an average of 36.13%, which significantly outperforms traditional methods. This performance consistency across 100 simulated urban scenarios proved the robustness and broad applicability of our model. Furthermore, our model shows an 18% improvement in resolving potential decision errors, with the stochastic solution further affirming a notable risk decrease of 27.18%.

I tested the effectiveness of market response by temporarily subsidizing operations in an unserved location and found that even a limited expansion of routing found passenger demand, showing a countercurrent of travel against the existing pattern of radial, central business district-to-suburb travel. Female street vendors were a particularly important previously unserved group of passengers. For operators, the study revealed that establishing new services can be difficult, requiring organizational capacity and substantial investment and risk in terms of time and money.

Due to the limitations in available real -world data and technological limitations, there have been limited investigations regarding the prediction of traffic states in road networks under adaptive signal timing. The purpose of this study is to provide a prediction method for variable -length traffic states and discuss the practical application of predictions within intelligent transportation systems. This study proposes an indicator called Phase flow Rate (PR) that integrates traffic states with signal timing information. We further introduce warping algorithm align the variable -length PR into shapes that can be accepted by the model. Finally, we propose an embedded attention spatio-temporal graph convolutional neural network (EASTGCN) for predicting PR in urban traffic systems. Base on two months of data from an urban network with an adaptive signal timing plan, experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively addresses the challenge of variable -length data due to irregular sampling. Moreover, EASTGCN outperforms state-of-the-art models, showing an improvement in prediction performance ranging from 10.6% to 21.2%.

The campus heat solution framework consists of preparation, mitigation and adaptation, thermal environment and comfort assessment, information -sharing platform, heat action plan, and post -assessment. An empirical study in Chongqing University, China based on field experiments, numerical simulations, and post -processing of outdoor thermal environments and comfort was conducted, to demonstrate the applicability of the framework in actual educational precincts. The results indicated the spatiotemporal variability of surface temperature and outdoor thermal comfort, exhibited the right time and proper cooling infrastructure selection, and identified the adaptive walkable paths. For instance, the universal thermal climate index (UTCI) with sun exposure had a mean value of 46.8 C and a maximum value of 51.4 C at 14:00, while the mean UTCI of the tree, sunshade and pavilion were 8.1 C, 9.3 C and 10.6 C lower than that of the full exposure means, respectively. Therefore, before 10:00 or after 18:00, choosing locations under trees, sunshades, or pavilions can ensure better thermal comfort at high temperatures. In comparison, from 10:00 to 13:00, it is essential to choose sunshades or pavilions, and from 13:00 to 18:00, it is preferable to choose only pavilions. Moreover, a suitable walkable path was determined based on cumulative heat stress.

On the urban design scale, it's important to consider short paths compatible with pedestrian behaviors, especially in public spaces, in terms of designing healthier and more accessible urban areas. But conventional design processes, which are mostly based on the designer's observations or intuitions, fail to satisfy user behaviors in usage. Studies reveal that P. polycephalum slime molds have the potential to guide good urban planning. However, it is noteworthy that there are not enough studies yet in the disciplines of architecture and urban design on the design of pedestrian ways in small-scale areas, and there is a need for research. In this direction, this study is the first step of a method that is aimed at being developed for the disciplines of architecture and urban design in the long process. The main hypothesis is that a design template can be created as a result of graphical analysis of living slime mold experiments on the map, especially in undesigned empty urban areas, for architects and planners, and it can provide creative suggestions to the designer. In this direction, in this study, a graphic design template proposal was created based on live cell experiments at a site in Izmir, Turkey, which the local government aims to design as a pedestrianized zone and open for competition. Slime molds are used directly as a computer rather than as inspiration for a computer, and a pedestrian-oriented design template proposal develops with the behavioral models of slime molds. Compared to the award-winning designs developed for the same area, it has been shown that even within the framework of simple graphical measurements, it gives better results and creates more optimal routes on main and side roads.

Such analyses are designed during conceptual work on the conditions and directions of the development of a studied area. Such documentation includes advanced research on the impact of natural conditions on the area's growth and evolution. In Warsaw, Poland, such a study makes it possible to define various natural areas that are essential for the appropriate functioning of the city and increase its inhabitants' well-being. This provides an initial basis for further analysis and motivates researchers to investigate the distribution of natural sites. It inspired the authors to assess the land-use structure in the context of the location of ventilation corridors. Thus, land use and land cover (LULC) modifications were examined in the context of their tendency to aid in the ventilation of the city. The object of the study is the Brodnowski Ventilation Corridor (BVC) - one of several designated for Warsaw in the spatial planning concepts of the 1980s and 1990s. In the research encompassing the years 1982-2020, the authors analysed the land use and roughness determined by the development characteristics and vegetation cover.

The research was prompted by the municipality's intention to urbanize the study area, which will undoubtedly eliminate the ventilation function of the southern part of the corridor and significantly reduce its remaining territory. Analysis of changes in the land cover of the south part of the corridor confirms its marginal importance for the city's ventilation. In this area, ongoing modifications proceed slowly, and urbanization - mainly low-rise and less intensive buildings - is limited.

The PLRP involves creating routes that ensure each customer is visited according to their waste demand frequency, aiming to minimize logistical costs such as transportation and depot opening. Unlike previous approaches, this approach characterizes each type of customer considering different needs for waste collection. A total of 25 customer types were created based on mixed waste demands and visit frequencies. The proposed algorithm uses Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) and Local Search heuristics, comprising three neighborhood generation structures.

This paradigm is also known as ad-hoc networks. IoT is characterized by several pieces of equipment called objects. These objects have different and limited capacities such as battery, memory, and computing power. These limited capabilities make it difficult to design routing protocols for IoT networks because of the high number of objects in a network. In IoT, objects often have data which does not belong to them and which should be sent to other objects, then leading to a problem known as permutation routing problems. The solution to that problem is found when each object receives its items. In this paper, we propose a new approach to addressing the permutation routing problem in single-hop IoT networks. To this end, we start by representing an IoT network as an oriented graph, and then, based on a reservation channel protocol, we first define a permutation routing protocol for an IoT in a single channel. Secondly, we generalize the previous protocol to make it work in multiple channels. Routing is done using graph theory approaches. The obtained results show that the wake-up times and activities of IoT objects are greatly reduced, thus optimizing network lifetime. This is an effective solution for the permutation routing problem in IoT networks. The proposed approach considerably reduces energy consumption and computation time. It saves 5.2 to 32.04% residual energy depending on the number of items and channels used. Low energy and low computational cost demonstrate that the performance of circuit-based and oriented graph theory is better than the state-of-the-art protocol and therefore is a better candidate for the resolution of the permutation routing problem in single-hop environment.",Circuit,IoT network,Oriented graph,Permutation routing protocol,,,,"Djoko, Celine Cabrelle Tchuenko",,"Myoupo, Jean Frederic",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Employing a quantitative methodology, the study hinged on time-based road matrix analysis, facilitated by Geographical Information Systems, to chart routes from & Ccedil;ankaya district to surrounding districts. During this analysis, preference was given to routes with gentle curves, mitigating negative impacts on vehicle speed compared to more convoluted alternatives. Subsequently, leveraging 21 distinct types of tourism attractions, tourism sites feasible for visits within 1, 2, and 3-h intervals were pinpointed. At the study's culmination, an assemblage of 841 daily tourist destinations in and around Ankara were meticulously delineated and cartographically depicted using MapInfo Pro 2019.3 version. This endeavor underscores a concerted effort to offer tourists, both local and beyond, a well-crafted roadmap to explore and relish the plethora of cultural, historical, and natural treasures that Ankara and its neighboring regions have to offer.",Geographic information systems,Tourism routes,Tourism venues,Ankara,,,,"Adiguzel, Asli Deniz",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Possible reasons include traffic congestion, difficulty in following instructions, or personal preferences, as evidenced by studies in human spatial cognition and transportation. Most path planning methods provide users with a single path, for example the shortest one, while a few give the user a set of paths to choose from. In the latter case, once a path from the given set is chosen, the rest are discarded. If the user were to deviate from the planned path, alternatives may not exist or may cause a significant delay to the user. Services such as Google Maps continuously monitor possible alternatives, but they may offer a path with no alternatives or few and lengthy ones. Taking a proactive approach to finding alternatives, we introduce the most flexible path - a path that maximises the number of alternatives the user has along a given path. This way, users may choose to take a different path midway and be more likely to have alternative paths available to them. Straightforward approaches to obtaining such a path have a prohibitive computational complexity. We introduce a set of algorithms that yield exact and approximate solutions to this problem. We then showcase the most flexible path's time-saving reroutes in a traffic congestion scenario.",Path planning,Planning,Australia,Approximation algorithms,,Urban areas,Roads,,Path planning algorithms,,navigation flexibility,reroutes,spatial data management,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the various route choices (including direct express trains, direct local trains, or transfers) covering different passenger groups pose a significant challenge to passenger flow assignment. To understand route choice behavior, it is crucial to measure the passenger heterogeneity (variability in individual and trip attributes) in order to propose targeted solutions for operation schemes and service planning. This paper proposes a hybrid model by integrating structural equation modeling and the mixed logit model under express/local mode to estimate the impact of passenger heterogeneity on route choice. An empirical study with revealed preference and stated preference surveys carried out in Shanghai revealed how individual and trip attributes quantitatively impact the sensitivity of factors in route choice. The results show that age and trip purpose are more significant factors. Compared to the control group, the probability of express trains is reduced by 10.22% for the elderly and by 11.36% for non-commuters.

With most of the world's population living in urban areas, the urban heat island effect and anthropogenic heat contribute to elevated city temperatures. This increase in urban warming threatens human health and demands a deeper understanding of thermal distribution in urban environments. Collecting accessible and widespread temperature data in urban areas is essential to address this challenge. This study aims to develop a methodology for anticipating temperature distribution in urban environments, leveraging Citizen Weather Stations (CWS) as valuable crowdsourcing data sources. The ultimate goal is to create a predictive model that estimates urban temperatures based on government meteorological station forecasts, improving urban planning, regulating temperature-based routes, preventing health issues in vulnerable populations, and enhancing urban livability. The methodology is divided into three fundamental stages: data acquisition through CWS with citizen collaboration, the development and evaluation of optimal forecast models based on government weather stations (SWS) data, and its exploitation in terms of utility and applicability. This methodology encompasses data collection and filtering to ensure its usefulness and implement reliable models. The resulting tool facilitates informed decision-making and precise seasonal event planning in urban environments, effectively addressing the challenges of climate extrapolation and contributing to more effective adaptation and mitigation strategies in climate change and heatwaves. The results obtained probe the feasibility of using CWS to predict temperatures in urban environments, which has been demonstrated accurately. This is a significant achievement, as CWS has proven to be a reliable source of climate data for this context. Also, the filtering process described and applied to the case study has proven effective, discarding approximately 34.87 % of the data. This is achieved by detecting and eliminating anomalies, considering station availability, and adhering to specific quality criteria. Finally, the developed prediction model has demonstrated its ability to optimally estimate urban temperatures, utilizing climate prediction data provided by government weather stations (SWS). The model performance indicators support this claim. For the linear regression model, a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 2.177 and an R-squared (R2) of 0.960 are obtained, while for the neural network, an MSE of 1.284 and an R2 of 0.976 are achieved.",Urban climate,Recovering street life,Adaptation climate change,Forecasting,,Social tool,,"Rodriguez, Laura Romero",,"Dominguez, Servando Alvarez",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This lowers the quality of delivery services, creating pockets of underserved populations in urban areas, which is undesirable from an economic and social perspective. The flexibility of drones has made them an attractive option for last-mile delivery in this context. Optimizing the utilization of remaining energy and payload capacity during drone return trips is essential for maximizing overall utility. However, prior studies have overlooked the consideration of backhaul in the context of drone-only systems, as well as the assessment of energy consumption under wind conditions. This paper proposes a new model for the Drone Delivery Routing Problem with Backhaul (DDRPB), which incorporates both wind conditions and backhauling requirements, and is applicable for areas that have high delivery demand and return requests, but suffer from low delivery service quality. We introduce a linearized drone-wind-energy consumption model and design a Lagrangian relaxation heuristic algorithm to solve the resulting NP-hard optimization problem efficiently.

In this study, an Urban Air Health Navigation System (UAHNS) was designed and proposed to assist users by recommending routes with the least PM2.5 exposure and dynamically issuing early risk warnings based on topologized digital maps, an application programming interface (API), an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model, and two-step spatial interpolation. A test of the UAHNS's functions and applications was carried out in Wuhan city. The results showed that, compared with trained random forest (RF), LightGBM, Adaboost models, etc., the XGBoost model performed better, with an R2 exceeding 0.90 and an RMSE of approximately 15.74 mu g/m3, based on data from national air and meteorological monitoring stations. Further, the two-step spatial interpolation model was adopted to dynamically generate pollution distribution at a spatial resolution of 300 m*300 m.

This paper focuses on a location -routing and demand allocation problem (LRDAP) in the household waste collection system where the household waste is initially allocated and transported to a set of intermediate transfer stations using a category of small garbage vehicles, and subsequently a fleet of large garbage vehicles visits each transfer station and transports the collected household waste to the waste disposal center for harmless treatment. The purpose is to simultaneously determine the location of transfer stations, the demand allocation of household waste collection and the routing plan of garbage vehicles while maximizing the efficiency of household waste collection within the whole system. Then, we formulate the proposed LRDAP into a mixed integer program.

The mismatch between the metro networks and the urban population has led to an imbalance between the supply and demand for rail transport, resulting in wasted urban infrastructure. Based on this issue, the research objective is to focus on the spatiotemporal variations of the matching relationship. Firstly, the topological network model abstractly extracted metro spatial distribution features, and the spatial autocorrelation model was adopted to identify the evolution characteristics of the metro networks and urban population. Secondly, this paper adopted a time-lagged regression model to demonstrate the action relationship from 2011 to 2021. Then, the compositive coordination index was utilized to assess the variation of the global matching relationship. Finally, the paper explored spatial heterogeneity through the coupling coherence degree attached to grid cells. The research results indicate that the Moran's I value of metro elements decreased from 0.782 to 0.510 with the further complexity of topological networks, while the population was consistently high in spatial dependence with a Moran's I value of around 0.75 during the decade. Based on the regression coefficients and significance, this paper verified the hypothesis that the metro networks and urban population had a positive time-lagged feedback effect in urban development. From 2011 to 2021, the compositive coordination index symbolizing the global matching relationship increased from 0.29 to 0.90, but the coupling coherence degree shows significant spatial heterogeneity in different grid units.

RD measured the internal connectivity, and D measured the connectivity between the internal and external road networks of GCs. GIS was used to measure RD and D, and SPSS was used to conduct a correlation analysis to identify significant variables. Multiple linear regression and LASSO regression were used to test the influence of these factors on RD and D. LASSO regression was employed to construct prediction models for RD and D.

However, the factors affecting tourist distributions in UNP activity and path spaces remain uncertain. Using Web crawler technology, location big data were tracked and sampled in Donghu National Park in Wuhan, China, and 12 predictor variables were analyzed using a machine-learning method (i.e., random forest). The consistency of the big data compared to the population census and tourist observations was determined at 79.5% and 77.8%, respectively. The tourist number (p) and tourist density (p/ha) per day in the park space in Donghu National Park were 0-2,531 p and 0-198.0 p/ha, respectively. Peak tourist periods showed pressure flows of 0.3-34.5 parts per thousand between scenic areas in the park. An analytical framework was formulated for UNPs to link the urban environment, park attributes, and configurational attributes, which here explained 66.4%-72.5% of the tourist distribution in the path and activity spaces. Random forest models performed better than geographically weighted regression (GWR) or ordinary least squares (OLS) models, indicating a complex nonlinear relationship between the independent variables and tourist distribution in UNP spaces, rather than the linear relationship that has previously been found in urban parks. First, both activity and path spaces near developed urban environments or park entrances bore higher tourism pressure. Second, winding routes attracted tourists to path spaces, while water landscapes attracted tourists to both path and activity spaces.

While considerable research has been conducted on the technologies and societal acceptance of autonomous vehicles, investigations into the control and scheduling of urban automated driving traffic are still nascent. As automated driving gains traction, urban traffic control logic is poised for substantial transformation. Presently, both manual and automated driving predominantly operate under a local decision-making traffic mode, where driving decisions are based on the vehicle's status and immediate environment. This mode, however, does not fully exploit the potential benefits of automated driving, particularly in optimizing road network resources and traffic efficiency. In response to the increasing adoption of automated driving, it is essential for traffic bureaus to initiate proactive dialogs regarding urban traffic control from a global perspective. This paper introduces a novel global control mode for urban automated driving traffic. Its core concept involves the central scheduling of all autonomous vehicles within the road network through vehicle-infrastructure cooperation, thereby optimizing traffic flow. This paper elucidates the mechanism and process of the global control mode. Given the operational complexity of expansive road networks, the paper suggests segmenting these networks into multiple manageable regions. This mode is conceptualized as an autonomous vehicle global scheduling problem, for which a mathematical model is formulated and a modified A-star algorithm is developed. The experimental findings reveal that (i) the algorithm consistently delivers high-quality solutions promptly and (ii) the global scheduling mode significantly reduces traffic congestion and equitably distributes resources.

This methodology consists of the following steps: 1. Delimitation of the urban categories to be evaluated; 2. Selection of the variables that characterize the abiotic and biotic environment; 3.

The global population has continued to increase steadily and, according to forecasts, the trend will be maintained in the coming decades. An increase in the 60+ population is yet another important demographic change. These determinants pose new challenges for socio-economic, spatial, and transport policies in most, if not all, cities in the world. These policies should be aligned with the global development paradigm to promote sustainable development and sustainable improvement of the quality of life of the present and future generations. In the coming years, the potential of cities should be recognized, resources should be managed rationally, effective spatial policies should be implemented, and user-friendly spaces should be created to promote the development of effectively managed urban areas. Cities are often compared to living organisms, which is why social mobility is a crucial determinant of urban development and is often used in assessments of cities. To address the above needs, a universal and innovative methodology for assessing the age-friendly walkability (AFW) of urban public spaces was developed and tested in the present study. The methodology was developed based on a review of the current trends in age-friendly cities, a survey of the target population, and a self-designed concept for evaluating the walkability of pedestrian routes in public space. The proposed methodology not only contributes to the existing knowledge but also has practical implications because it was tested in a Polish city to classify the 15 minute walkability of pedestrian routes and to identify Strategic Intervention Areas for the 60+ population (SAI 60+).

An optimized two-phase nonlinear model is formulated in order to design a periodic train schedule, where train headways remain constant over a specific period. This model takes into account the flexible train composition. The objective function aims to minimize total passenger waiting time and train operating costs while considering constraints such as maximum line passing capacity, passenger flow demand, and the number of train units in the composition. Linearization techniques are applied to convert nonlinear constraints into linear equivalents, and the CPLEX solver is employed to solve the model. An illustrative real-case example is presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results demonstrate that the operation mode with flexible train composition during off-peak periods offers significant advantages over traditional train composition modes, including single train routes, long-short train routes, and multiple train compositions. This mode enables better alignment between passenger demand and capacity, reduces operating costs, and enhances passenger service levels.

The focus of the research is to use a variety of soft computing technologies such as Hausdorff dimension simplification method, branch dimension measurement algorithm, multifractal method, etc., to analyze the overall traffic load and guide the traffic channelization in an optimal way, considering various factors comprehensively. The model helps to optimize infrastructure and reduce road traffic congestion. This avoids traffic congestion, ultimately reducing the carbon footprint and promoting a green environment. This method analyzes the network capacity, network load and corresponding conversion coefficient of all levels of highway. Based on the multi -component linear regression method, this paper evaluates the urban road network capacity, and constructs the urban road network capacity planning model according to the traffic volume constraints and travel time constraints. The test results show that under the application of this method, the road capacity of the planned route exceeds 4000 pcu. The pcu is a passenger vehicle unit that measures the extent to which different types of vehicles have an impact on road capacity. When the capacity of a planned road exceeds 4000 pcu, it means that the road can carry a large number of different types of vehicles at the same time, and the average operating speed of the line can reach 42.3 km/h.

This study aimed to explore the factors influencing route selections made by private and public bike users and compare their decisions during peak and off-peak hours. Global positioning system (GPS) traces of 12,106 private bike users and 74,397 public bike users from a single weekday in Seoul, South Korea, were used. A map-matching process aligned the GPS data with a comprehensive cycling network encompassing bikeways, sidewalks, neighborhood roads, and their street attributes such as urban, park, and river streets.

By employing a path-size logit model to address overlapping issues among the routes, the results showed that buffered bike lanes separated from car flows positively influenced the route selection of bicyclists. Bike boulevards and shared sidewalk bikeways negatively impacted route decisions made by public bike users, with a more pronounced effect during peak hours. Furthermore, private bike users showed a decreased preference for routes in residential areas during peak hours, while an increased preference during off-peak hours.

Firstly, the health impact assessment component of the state planning approval of a major road project, and secondly, local government placement of childcare centres and schools in relation to freight routes. Three sources of air quality monitoring data were examined: (i) a Victorian EPA reference site; (ii) a site with planning approval for development into a childcare centre; and (iii) five sites within the boundary of the West Gate Tunnel Project, an AUD 10 billion road and tunnel project. The Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network data was utilised to assess distances of childcare centres and schools from major truck routes. A range of cconcentration-response functions for childhood asthma (0-18 years) from international systematic meta-analyses and a smaller Australian cross-sectional study were applied to comparative elevations in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations between the EPA reference monitor (used for project risk assessment) and local roadside data.

Despite the systems' low cost and high reliability, potential pipeline failures would cause serious human injury, environmental impact, and financial costs. In order to reduce these damages, it is essential to study risk factors and investigate high-risk locations using existing risk factors. Spatial analysis is an appropriate method for studying environmental phenomena. Considering the extent of various factors influencing pipeline risk and their spatial dependence, we conducted a spatial analysis using ArcGIS to identify vulnerable areas and high-risk points in natural gas pipelines. For this purpose, the local influencing factors and their impact distance were determined by reviewing previous studies and then scored according to the risk level using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method. The risk of natural gas pipelines was then analyzed using these scores, the relationships developed, and the maps produced from the various factors. The results showed that most gas pipelines are exposed to various risks including dangers and geographical risks. Among these risks, faults play an important role, affecting about 97% of natural gas pipelines. In general, out of 13,875 km of general Iranian natural gas pipelines, 13,411 km are in various risk areas and 1,054 km are in high-risk areas, which are located at more than 4,300 points. The study of planned pipeline routes for future development also showed that these lines are located in relatively suitable areas. However, some changes to the routes could reduce the risks.

In recent years, bus passenger flow has been declining in many cities. How to reform the operating mode of the public transportation system is an important issue that needs to be solved. An autonomous modular bus (AMB) is capable of physical coupling and uncoupling to flexibly adjust vehicle capacity as well as provide high-quality service under unbalanced passenger demand conditions. To promote AMB adoption and reduce the operating cost of the bus route, this paper presents a joint optimization method to simultaneously determine the AMB dispatching plan, charging plan, and charging infrastructure configuration scheme. Then, a mixed-integer programming model is formulated to minimize the operating costs of the bus route. A hybrid intelligent algorithm combining enumeration, cloning algorithm, and particle swarm optimization algorithm is designed to resolve the formulated model. Subsequently, an actual bus route is taken as an example to validate the proposed method. Results indicate that the developed method in this paper can reduce the operating costs and operational energy consumption of the route compared with the real route operating plan. Specifically, the reduction ratio of the former is 23.85%, and the reduction ratio of the latter is 5.92%.

Combining data from different types of sensors shows promise for comprehensive perception of global traffic, but it remains challenging. Stationary roadside units only gather sparse trajectories of passing vehicles, while crowd -sourced data records entire trajectories but only consists of a very low sample rate of vehicles. Therefore, there is a need to learn route choice behavior from crowd -sourced data to infer complete paths for the sparse trajectories. Existing route choice models assume path set enumeration or the Markovian property for simplicity, which leaves room for capturing the long sequence of choice behavior from data for added precision. Additionally, the path inference problem is often broken down into multiple independent route choice problems between any consecutive sparse observations, leaving room for exploring one-shot long -sequence inference. To address these challenges, we propose RoutesFormer, an efficient sequence -based, datadriven route choice Transformer that requires minimal assumptions due to the capacity of the model architecture. By being sequence -based, RoutesFormer unifies the route choice and path inference problems, accommodating all observations together and avoiding the need to break down the problem into separate route choices, thereby improving optimality. Experiments conducted on the Shanghai taxi dataset demonstrate that RoutesFormer has made significant improvements over six existing baseline models in various challenging path inference tasks. Specifically, RoutesFormer has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy with an average total link length accuracy of 0.914/0.870 compared to the baselines' best average accuracy of 0.896/0.845, and it ranks first across all tasks.

One way to achieve this is through the urban forest; the collection of trees in an urban area. Specifically, it is the characteristics of trees within this forest that can provide the structural and functional connectivity that enables wildlife to move effectively through urban areas. To investigate this, we explored the influence of four tree characteristics, alone and in combination, on bat commuting activity along 30 potential movement corridors in an urban setting in north central Texas. Along 10, 30, and 50 m corridor sections, we calculated percent canopy cover, maximum gap distance between canopies, and canopy rugosity using a 60 cm resolution tree canopy layer, while maximum tree height was determined in situ. We then conducted behavioral observations using thermal cameras and acoustic monitoring along the 10 m section of each site between March and September of 2022 and 2023 to determine the amount of time bats were observed commuting/h and species present. Our analysis revealed that increasing percent canopy cover and rugosity positively influenced commuting activity up to a certain threshold (> 60% and > 1.3, respectively), beyond which they may became detrimental. In contrast, the presence of gaps in the canopy lowered commuting, while tree heights > 11 m increased this activity. When considered together, bats in our study area showed a preference for commuting routes with tall trees and straighter, less cluttered canopies with no gaps. Additionally, sites with these features had a greater species diversity. These findings suggest that we can manage and plan the urban forest by establishing an interconnecting network of tree-lines and forest edges to enhance landscape permeability for bats and subsequently aid urban bat conservation.",Chiroptera,commuting activity,functional connectivity,movement corridors,,tree height,urban forest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Traditional stationary sensors, costly with limited coverage, have prompted the emergence of mobile sensing (e.g., vehicular urban sensing), which utilizes ubiquitous mobile devices (e.g., sensors on vehicles) for sensing tasks. While commercial vehicles (e.g., taxis) are favored for urban sensing due to easy data collection, biased spatiotemporal distributions often result in uneven sensing coverage. Despite efforts to maximize task completion and incentivize participation, fairness in coverage distribution remains neglected. To address this issue, we propose a hybrid approach integrating Dedicated Sensing Vehicles (DSVs) and commercial vehicles to optimize coverage while accounting for fairness constraints. Routing these DSVs for fairness-aware spatiotemporal coverage poses unique challenges, including achieving high coverage with limited DSVs, prioritizing underserved areas, and ensuring cost efficiency for financial sustainability. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we design FairSense, a system, which combines the long-term reward optimization capabilities of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with submodular maximization. FairSense integrates a submodular reward function with spatio-temporal fairness constraints into a DRL algorithm to prioritize long-term gain and fairness, enabling informed path planning for DSVs, thereby enhancing efficiency and fairness in sensing coverage. We evaluate our FairSense with real-world large-scale vehicle GPS data from two cities (i.e., Shenzhen and Beijing), and extensive experiments show our FairSense can effectively improve sensing coverage efficiency and also improve sensing fairness.",Urban Sensing,Spatio-temporal Fairness,Submodular Optimization,Reinforcement Learning,"2024 IEEE 21ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MOBILE AD-HOC AND SMART SYSTEMS, MASS 2024",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, the collection of OD flow data is extremely difficult due to the hindrance of privacy issues and collection costs. Significant efforts have been made to generate OD flow based on urban regional features, e.g., demographics, land use, and so on, since spatial heterogeneity of urban function is the primary cause that drives people to move from one place to another. On the other hand, people travel through various routes between OD, which will have effects on urban traffic, e.g., road travel speed and time.

The results show that people highly value the different contributions provided by urban ponds, and that contact with nature is the main motivation for visiting urban pondscapes. Their positive view about the provided NCPs and also their acknowledgement of an improved quality of life suggest a public acceptance of these ponds. We also found that gender and income do not influence public perception of the contributions provided by urban pondscapes. Additionally, the biodiversity of urban ponds was highly appreciated, but there was a knowledge gap relating to biodiversity conservation, as both native and exotic species were valued equally. In conclusion, ponds are Nature-based Solutions that are very well adapted and accepted in cities, and in the future they should be part of the greening (and blueing) of urban planning to conserve and enhance freshwater biodiversity whilst also providing NCPs.",Urbanisation,Urban ponds and pondscapes,Constructed wetlands,Public perception,,Aquatic biodiversity,Nature's contribution to people,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This way, the warming combination with human-induced urban interventions with climate change reshapes the strategic decision-making that public managers must deal with to promote safety and preparedness. Consequently, it implies complex situations under uncertainty that comprise conflicting dilemmas about which decision-makers (DMs) should establish trade-offs. Given this backdrop, this work proposes a risk-based multidimensional model for assessing urban shelter location against flood risk with Decision Analysis and Multi-Attribute Utility Theory. By using principles of the Queue Theory, the decision model undertakes four criteria that measure in a probabilistic manner the alternatives' performance when considering urban flood disaster evacuation routes in affected areas. Altogether, it enables the DM to establish his/her preferences with views to rank potential locations for mounting temporary shelters and for planning emergency preparedness in risky areas. Being replicable to any urban context, our proposal has the potential to support and promote the development and implementation of crisis protocols consisting of measures to reduce flood impacts and adapt critical areas to climate change. From a numerical application of the proposed model, the DM is encouraged to explore graphical and tabular visualization tools, as well as sensitivity analysis, to establish in strategic terms how to design and implement emergency shelters to reduce flood risks in urban areas effectively.",Emergency preparedness,Urban flood,MAUT,Decision analysis,,Multicriteria decision-making,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, URT's function in transporting substantial numbers of passengers within confined public spaces renders it vulnerable to the proliferation of infectious diseases during public health crises. This study proposes a decision support model that integrates operational control strategies pertaining to passenger flow and train capacity utilization, with an emphasis on energy efficiency within URT networks during such crises. The model anticipates a URT system where passengers adhere to prescribed routes, adhering to enhanced path flow regulations. Simultaneously, train capacity utilization is intentionally limited to support social distancing measures. The model's efficacy was assessed using data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Xi'an, China, at the end of 2021. Findings indicate that focused management of passenger flows and specific risk areas is superior in promoting energy efficiency and enhancing passenger convenience, compared to broader management approaches.",energy efficiency,urban rail transit,public health emergency,targeted management,,capacity utilization rate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A major daily operational task in these systems is planning a fleet to rebalance the bikes over time, ensuring the optimal availability of bikes and docks to users. Recycling is also a daily work with the an increase in the number of broken bikes. However, rebalancing or recycling operation is always regarded as an independent tasks. They are separately studied in existing papers. Thus, this paper develops an operational strategy for recycling broken bikes during the rebalancing process, and studies the combination of the station inventory and vehicle routing problems. First, an inventory routing model is constructed with the aim of minimizing the total costs including procurement, expected user loss, inventory and transportation costs. Then, a two-stage iterative algorithm is developed with both exact and heuristic algorithms. We use real-world data from Capital Bikeshare to test our proposed model and approach, which shows the two-stage iterative algorithm is efficient and outperforms existing solutions in reducing total costs. Finally, the sensitivity analysis is performed on key parameters such as the vehicle's capacity, unit penalty costs for customer dissatisfaction events, unit inventory holding costs and the observation period of rebalancing. It shows that enterprises can reduce the total cost by altering vehicle's capacity, reducing the unit inventory holding costs or changing the observation period of rebalancing.",Bike-sharing systems,inventory routing problem,recycling broken bikes,two-stage iterative algorithm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The perishable nature of these goods, characterized by short expiration dates and susceptibility to spoilage, presents significant challenges to their transportation. This paper proposed an intermodal transportation route optimization method for perishable goods, considering the use of refrigerated containers and customer satisfaction. The route optimization model minimizes quality loss, transportation costs, and carbon emissions while treating customer satisfaction as a constraint. Using the ""Urumqi-Shanghai"" intermodal transportation network as an example, the model applies a multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm for solution and conducts sensitivity analysis to explore the impact of changes in transportation modes and customer satisfaction constraints on three objectives, ultimately obtaining the optimal transportation route between the origin and destination. The results show that intermodal transportation of perishable goods generally has cost advantage over singlemode transportation. The constraint on customer satisfaction can eliminate uneconomical routes and provide more options to meet the changing customer demands. An increase in customer satisfaction can also reduce the quality loss of perishable goods during transportation. These improvements confirm the effectiveness of the proposed intermodal transportation route optimization model and the importance of incorporating customer satisfaction into the choice of transportation route for perishable goods. The proposed model is expected to provide valuable insights into model development and its applications for transporting perishable goods.",Perishable goods transportation,Customer satisfaction,Intermodal transport,Route optimization model,,Refrigerated containers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Addressing this challenge, we introduce a pioneering decentralized path planning model, DPPDRL, built upon the foundations of deep reinforcement learning. Drawing inspiration from human path planning and dynamic coupling techniques, DPPDRL imbues AGVs with the autonomy to independently dictate and dynamically adapt their paths in real time. Notably, DPPDRL champions the adoption of diverse policies, thereby facilitating efficient collision avoidance and exploration of potential routes. Simulation-based evidence substantiates critical findings, including remarkable improvements in training speed and scalability, heightened adaptability to environmental variations and agent number changes, and applicability across any number of AGVs, provided a reasonable task distribution. However, DPPDRL's performance becomes limited when tasks are densely concentrated. Addressing this issue through task distribution and hierarchical reinforcement learning is a promising direction for future research.

The study was conducted in urban forests in five urban parks in Upper Silesia (southern Poland) and investigated the chemical properties and content of potentially toxic metals (PTMs) in the topsoil, which had an average thickness of 15 cm for all samples. The soil reaction ranged from acidic (pH = 4.7-5.1, in KCl) to slightly acidic (pH = 5.6, to neutral-6.6-7.2) at most sites. The organic carbon (OC) content was relatively high at all sites, ranging from 1.19 to 14.3%, with the highest total nitrogen (Nt) content being 0.481%. The average total phosphorus (Pt) content in the parks ranged from 310 mg kg(-1) to 684 mg kg(-1), while the highest values were 1840 mg kg(-1). The total Cr, Cu, Co and Ni content was within acceptable limits, while the Zn, Pb, Cd, As, Sr and Ba exceeded acceptable standards. In terms of content, Zn dominated the PTMs at each site (Zn > Pb > Ba > Sr > Cu > Cr > As > Ni > Cd > Co), while Ba and Pb alternated in taking second place (Zn > Ba > Pb > Sr > Cu > Cr > Ni > As > Co > Cd). Environmental indicators, such as the geoaccumulation index (Igeo), enrichment factor (EF) and potential ecological risk index (RI), showed that the analyzed soils are highly contaminated with PTMs. Among the sources of pollution in the urban forest are low emissions from coal combustion, industrial activities, water runoff from streets and proximity to transportation routes. Identification of PTM levels in urban parks will provide valuable information on the behavior of these metals, which is important in sustainable development and can help evaluate the local spatial development plans of urbanized areas.",forest and urban parks,urban soil,soil pollution,environmental indicators,,trace elements,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In response to escalating urban traffic congestion, simultaneously, many cities have implemented widespread traffic restriction policies. Scientifically optimizing the charging strategies for electric logistics fleets and formulating rational distribution plans are pivotal pathways for developing more efficient and intelligent IoEV. To address the problem, an EV routing problem of heterogeneous fleet with time window under traffic constraints is formulated, featuring strategies for demand-driven charging within the IoEV and staggered traffic restriction periods. Given the intricate nature of this mathematical model, it is divided into two sub problems, from which two integer programming models are derived. To tackle this model, a two-tier optimization approach is employed, and an improved ant colony optimization algorithm integrated with variable neighborhood search is proposed. Experimental results show that the proposed model reduces the cost by 9.80%-15.68%, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed charging and staggered traffic restriction strategies, as well as the influence of different traffic restriction factors.

In order to explore the relationship between urban road network structure characteristics and urban fringe tourist areas, this study chose Kunming Lake in Xi'an City as the research object and obtained the consumer development characteristics of urban fringe tourist areas through a comparison of POI data. We explored the traffic development trend in urban fringe tourist areas based on a spatial syntactic model by quantifying the road network structure characteristics using the indexes related to depth, integration, and choice. The results of the study show that the consumer development level of the urban fringe tourism area is poor compared with that of the built-up scenic area, and tourists tend to travel in the scenic area but do not live in this neighborhood. The average normalized depth values in the axial and segmental maps were 0.52 and 0.42, respectively, indicating that expressways and ring roads can improve the accessibility of urban fringe tourist areas. The expansion of motorized transportation activities gradually increases the importance of urban fringe tourist areas. There is a significant correlation between the road network density and route selection, although the correlation between the two gradually decreases as the measured radius increases.

In this context, a generated trajectory refers to the macro-level path selection between an origin and a destination, tailored to incorporate real-time, personalized routing preferences that accommodate individual user needs and current traffic conditions. Nevertheless, existing studies frequently fail to account for the continuity of the generated trajectories, leading to an accumulation of errors, and often do not cater to personalized user requirements. This paper presents a framework based on Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) to facilitate the generation of personalized, continuous trajectories that accurately mirror real-world conditions and user preferences, thereby avoiding the pitfalls of error accumulation. Departing from conventional grid-based spatial-temporal methods, our framework aligns generated trajectories directly with the actual road network and takes into account surrounding Points of Interest (POIs) that could influence travel decisions. Our approach offers a solution to users unsure about waypoint inclusion in their travel plans, greatly enhancing their experience by providing a range of flexible and personalized options.

The extracted temporal and spatial features are fused to achieve short-term prediction. Considering the travel willingness of drivers and passengers, a multi-objective optimization model with minimum driver and passenger loss time and total travel time is established under the constraints of vehicle capacity, time windows and detour distances. An Improved Non-dominated Sorted Genetic Algorithm-II (INSGA-II) is proposed to solve it. The open-loop saving algorithm is used to generate an initial population with better quality, and the 2-opt local search strategy is adopted in the mutation operation to improve search efficiency.

Urban rail transit (URT) in these cities is essential for public transportation and serves as the backbone of the urban transportation system. However, inadequate last train connections and poor timetable planning create problems in operation and management, preventing passengers from having a seamless journey within the URT system. This problem undoubtedly increases travel time and costs for passengers. To tackle this problem, we need to assess the performance of the previous train timetable for train operations. This article focuses on the Beijing and Shanghai Rail Transit Systems, creating a dynamic URT last train network (LTN) model. By studying the network's organizational mechanism using percolation theory, we evaluate the performance of the LTN in both systems and identify crucial last trains using a network performance evaluation framework. The results reveal that the critical percolation time of the network is an important operational parameter that reflects the reasonableness of network connection. The identification of the crucial last train highlights that, in the presence of alternative routes within the network, even if the line in question bears a significant passenger load, its impact on the LTN remains relatively minimal. With the proposed method in this study, it is possible to effectively evaluate the performance of the LTN in URT systems, providing theoretical support for URT operators in formulating practical operational plans.",Urban rail transit,Percolation theory,Critical last train,Network performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
