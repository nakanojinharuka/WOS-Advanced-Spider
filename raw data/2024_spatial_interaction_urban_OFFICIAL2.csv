This entails creating a sense of belonging, prioritizing safe, inclusive, accessible, and green public spaces, and enhancing social interactions, cultural expressions, and political participation. It also involves fostering social cohesion, inclusion, and security in peaceful and pluralistic societies that meet the needs of all, especially the most vulnerable. However, despite the institutionalization of participatory planning in urban governance processes over several decades, doubts are growing about the rhetoric and effectiveness of the experiences implemented and their transformative and empowering nature. This paper examines the capacity of existing norms and tools to renew public participation and establish a meaningful and fruitful connection with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The paper emphasizes the need to articulate the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in a more accessible and actionable manner for policymakers, urban practitioners, and a broad range of urban stakeholders. It explores the actual contribution and the potential for improvement of international standards in supporting regional and local governments in effectively implementing the SDGs through inclusive processes of public participation. Moreover, these standards establish a common language, set expectations, enable monitoring of processes and outputs, and facilitate the dissemination of best practices and achieved results.

However, the driving mechanism of this unbalance is unclear, and the determination of ecological compensation standard (ECS) is not unified. This study uses the ecological footprint (EF) model and integrated inversion model to complete the intelligent evaluation and prediction of ecological supply-demand performance in the BTHUA. The extended nonlinear STIRPAT model and geographic detector are integrated to identify the driving mechanism of EF and its spatial differentiation. ECS at different spatiotemporal scales are then given with consideration of ecological service value and Monte Carlo simulation. Results reveal that EF of the BTHUA exhibits a downward trend, especially under the sustainable scenario (SSP1), falling by 16.85 %. But all cities would be still in unsafety states by 2035, with an average EF value of 6.210 hm2/cap, which is over 27 times greater than its EC. The spatial distribution of EF differs significantly, and high-value areas gradually migrate to the north. The variation of EF is primarily influenced by industrial structure, with population factors and environmental factors following. Per capita GDP is a key factor causing spatial differentiation of EF. The key driving factors and their explanatory powers on EF vary across cities, and the interaction of multiple factors affects EF more than a single in the BTHUA. Past-to-future ECS of the BTHUA shows a decreasing trend, with high-value areas distributed in the pivotal cities for economic development. A total of 19.13 x 1010 CNY needs to be paid to compensate for ecological damage of the BTHUA. Uncertainty analysis shows that ECS is extremely sensitive to grassland footprint in most cities. Furthermore, environmental footprints as well as system dynamics considering multiple factors are still required for comprehensively evaluating the ecological environment quality and further exploring ecological compensation evaluation framework with incorporating various ecological service functions such as carbon sinks in the BTHUA. Findings can facilitate improving regional sustainability and provide a valid approach to determine ECS for the BTHUA and similar regions worldwide.",Ecological footprint,Urban agglomeration,Driving factor,Spatial differentiation,"Yu, Kairu","Li, Jing",ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW,Geographic detector,Ecological compensation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transformation towards digitization in the public health sector serves as a key indicator of this economic shift. Understanding how the digital economy continuously improves the efficiency of public health services and its various pathways of influence has become increasingly important. It is essential to clarify the impact mechanism of the digital economy on public health services to optimize health expenditures and advance digital economic construction. This study investigates the impact of digital economic development on the efficiency of public health services from a novel perspective, considering social media usage and urban-rural healthcare disparities while constructing a comprehensive index of digital economic development. The findings indicate that the digital economy reduces the efficiency of public health services primarily through two transmission mechanisms: the promotion of social media usage and the widening urban-rural healthcare gap. Moreover, these impacts and transmission pathways exhibit spatial heterogeneity. This study unveils the intrinsic connection and mechanisms of interaction between digital economic development and the efficiency of public health services, providing a theoretical basis and reference for government policy formulation.

This study presents an applied groundwater modelling project that attempts to capture the complexity and quantify the uncertainty of groundwater flow and mass transport in urban environments using recently developed methods. A python scripting approach was used for model development and preparation of a calibration constrained parameter uncertainty analysis using the iterative ensemble smoother method (IES). Water supply and sewer infrastructure locations were explicitly included in the numerical model as boundary conditions with adjustable parameters during the calibration. The model calibration, and predictive uncertainty analysis considered more than 100,000 independent parameters, which were applied at zones, pilot points and directly on the model grid to define model properties, boundary conditions, and initial conditions. Calibration observations included both water level and concentration measurements at 18 boreholes over the 12-year operational life of a remediation system. The IES method was applied to calibrate 120 alternative and equally plausible parameter realizations. Initial parameter values were produced from initial statistical distributions defined by parameter bounds and based on the conceptual hydrogeological model, literature review and spatial correlations of hydraulic properties observed in well tests. The Amazon EC2 cloud computing service was used to provide the parallel computing capacity necessary to complete the project within a reasonable timeframe. Predictions of long-term mass transport towards a creek after the termination of active remediation were made with 47 of the resulting IES calibrated parameter sets. The IES method provided a distribution of potential impacts and allowed decisions about the future of the current remediation system to be made based on a quantitative, statistical, risk-based analysis. The extremely high degree of model parameterization allowed the complexity and uncertainty of an urban groundwater systems to be represented using adjustable model parameters, which reduced the likelihood of structural model error and biased predictions. This study found that fully python scripted model development and calibration setup, combined with IES, successfully allowed for improved representation of urban groundwater systems in numerical models. The post calibration groundwater flow budget of the model showed that groundwater interactions with sewer and water supply infrastructure are of similar magnitude to distributed recharge, and the omission of representing infrastructure in urban groundwater models could result in misleading predictions.",Urban groundwater,Numerical Modelling,Uncertainty analysis,,,,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, urbanization has significantly affected regional vegetation phenology and can potentially weaken the cooling potential of vegetation. Previous studies have mainly focused on national and regional vegetation phenology, but local-scale vegetation phenology and dynamic variations in built-up areas remain unclear. Therefore, this study characterized the vegetation phenology in the densely built-up area of Beijing, China over the period of 2000-2020 based on high-resolution NDVI data using Savitzky-Golay filtering and explored its spatiotemporal characteristics and drivers. The results indicate that the vegetation phenology exhibits significant spatial heterogeneity and clustering characteristics. Compared with vegetation in peripheral blocks, vegetation in central urban blocks generally has an earlier start in the growing season (SOS), later end in the growing season (EOS), and a longer growing season length (GSL). However, the overall distribution of these parameters has experienced a process of decentralization along with urbanization. In terms of drivers, vegetation phenology indicators are mainly influenced by background climate. Specifically, SOS and GSL are mainly affected by temperature (TEP), whereas EOS is mainly influenced by annual precipitation (PRE). Additionally, local environmental factors, particularly the percentage of water body (WAP), also have an impact. Notably, the local environment and background climate have a synergistic effect on vegetation phenology, which is greater than their individual effects. Overall, this study extends the current knowledge on the response of vegetation phenology to urbanization by investigating long-term vegetation phenology dynamics in dense urban areas and provides new insights into the complex interactions between vegetation phenology and built environments.",vegetation phenology,built-up environment,spatiotemporal characteristics,interactions,,,FORESTS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) serves as a crucial metric for assessing organic contamination in aquatic environments. Consequently, the spatiotemporal characteristics and driving factors of COD emissions have emerged as a significant area of current research interest. This study employs spatial autocorrelation and geodetector methods to rigorously analyze the spatial -temporal patterns and principal drivers of COD emissions in China 's wastewater, drawing on eleven geographic and socio-economic datasets spanning from 2011 to 2019. This study indicates that COD emissions in China 's wastewater have consistently decreased annually between 2011 and 2019, with a marked reduction observed post -2016. Regarding spatial distribution, COD emissions in the eastern region significantly surpass those in the western region, highlighting pronounced regional disparities. The analysis of the global Moran 's Index indicates that the COD emissions across China 's provincial regions demonstrate spatial clustering of similar values, with this clustering intensifying annually. Furthermore, the local Moran 's Index identifies the precise locations of these spatial clusters. Geodetector analysis identified that the consumption of nitrogen fertilizers and the consumption of chemical fertilizers had substantial impacts on COD emissions, whereas the proportion of urban population at year-end and the number of granted inventions exerted lesser effects. Furthermore, the interaction between two factors notably enhances the explanatory power regarding COD emissions.

However, con fl icts, by de fi nition, unfold not only in space but also in time: as a sequence of interconnected events of a certain duration. In this article, relying on the ""sociology of processuality"" by Andrew Abbott and the methodology for con fl ict episodes analysis, I consider one of the temporal dimensions of urban con fl icts - the ordering of actions in time (sequencing). The selection of analytical tools for analyzing event sequences is carried out taking into account their key features: the ""path dependency"" (dependence of the current situation on past states of the process) and ""plurisectality"" (repetition of the same stages in an episode of con fl ict). The analysis of urban con fl ict episodes serves as an instrument that allows to track the interactions between the challengers (active citizens) and the initiators of urban transformation projects (developers or public authorities), with the addition of a ""fourth party"" acting as a mediator or ally of the main participants in the con fl ict. The database of urban con fl icts in Russian cities with a population of over a million built in accordance with this logic, makes it possible to examine the sequences more closely and conduct an exploratory analysis of its variation. Collected data on 259 con fl icts show that there are signi fi cant di ff erences between cities and con fl ict types in average estimates of duration, length and intensity of con fl icts. An analysis of the sequences in con fl icts over the development of recreational areas and in fi ll development also indicates signi fi cant diversity in the content of con fl ict episodes, but the common denominator is the active role of citizens and public authorities, with a much smaller share of the actions of developers and the fourth party. Half of the sequences are short (up to 5 - 6 actions), while long episodes with a large number of actions slightly increase the likelihood of a favorable outcome for residents.

This research took the diversification process of grid blocks as an angle to understand the transformation process of Beijing's urban morphology. It took 194 grid blocks within the 3rd Ring Road of Beijing as research objects. First, the paper proposed a whole view of Beijing's grid blocks by 1) visualizing their construction process, 2) classifying 5 morphological clusters by 7 indicators (Block size, Block shape regularity, Intensity, Coverage, Network density, Plot shape regularity, Standard deviation of plot size), and 3) investigating their distribution. Second, the diversification process of grid blocks was clarified from two layers: the block-boundary layer and the inner-space layer. Finally, the mechanism of block form diversification was clarified by exploring the connections between elements in each layer, and the influence of urban development on block form transformation. The study re-defined the diversification process in a more quantitative way from both time and spatial dimension. It concluded that the diversification is influenced by changes in urban planning principles and locations, and emerged thorough the long-term transformation and resubdivision. The interaction between the boundary and the inner space stimulates the diversification. And based on these, it concluded with a discussion of limitations and potentials on grid blocks' construction and renovation. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

Shaped by urbanization policies, this locale has encountered a gamut of issues, including an imbalance in human-environment dynamics and the degradation of ecological integrity. Consequently, the comprehension of how urban expansion impacts the optimization of regional landscape configurations, the alignment of human-environment interactions in the Loess Plateau's hilly and gully domains, and the mitigation of urban ecological challenges assumes paramount importance. Leveraging data from land use remote sensing monitoring, alongside inputs from natural geography and socio-economic spheres, and employing methodologies such as landscape pattern indices, we conduct an exhaustive analysis of Zichang City's urban fabric from 1980 to 2020. Furthermore, employing the CLUE-S model, we undertake multifaceted scenario simulations to forecast urban expansion in Zichang City through to 2035. Our findings delineate two distinct phases in Zichang City's urban expansion trajectory over the past four decades. From 1980 to 2000, urban construction land in Zichang City experienced a phase of methodical and steady growth, augmenting by 64.98 hectares, alongside a marginal decrease in the landscape shape index (LSI) by 0.02 and a commensurate increase in the aggregation index (AI) by 1.17. Conversely, from 2000 to 2020, urban construction land in Zichang City witnessed an epoch of rapid and haphazard expansion, doubling in expanse, marked by a notable escalation in LSI (2.45) and a corresponding descent in the AI (2.85). The precision of CLUE-S model simulations for Zichang City's land use alterations registers at 0.88, fulfilling the exigent demand for further urban expansion and land use change prognostication. Under the aegis of the natural development scenario, the augmentation of urban construction land in Zichang City primarily encroaches upon grassland, farmland, and woodland, effectuating an increase of 159.81 hectares. Conversely, under the ambit of urbanization development, urban construction land contends predominantly with farmland, grassland, and woodland, heralding an augmentation of 520.42 hectares. Lastly, under the mantle of ecological protection, urban construction land expansion predominantly encroaches upon grassland, farmland, and woodland, resulting in an augmentation of 4.27 hectares.

Existing methodologies, often focused on DBS trips around metro stations or limited by scant datasets, overlook the pressing need for a method to discern large-scale DBS-metro trips as DBS becomes a standard feeder mode for metro trips and the yet unexplored spatial lag effects of the built environment on DBS-metro interactions. To bridge these gaps, we develop a method integrating smart card records and DBS data, revealing a comprehensive trip chain encompassing both metro and DBS. Our application of association rule algorithms to large-scale data provides detailed spatial insights into feeder trips. We employ a network-adjacency-based partial spatial Durbin model, tailored with a negative binomial regression for count data and maximum likelihood estimation for continuous data. Analysis from Shenzhen reveals: (1) A strong correlation is observed between the count of trips using cycling as a feeder mode (COUNT) and the location of stations within the metro network structure. Notably, the COUNT shows more significant aggregation when compared to the ratio of DBS-metro transfer trips to the total metro trips at each station (RATIO); (2) significant influence of both local and adjacent spatial variables of the built environment on the RATIO and COUNT of cycling trips; (3) specific factors like feeder station location, city center proximity, Street greenness view situation, and road intersection density significantly influencing the cycling feeder mode for metro trips; (4) Moreover, areas with more urban villages and industry appeared to contribute to the cycling feeder mode for metro trips, both in terms of RATIO and COUNT.

However, traditional crowd behavior prediction models tend to learn regular trends and patterns of crowd traffic, and usually fail to predict the abnormal traffic fluctuations triggered by urban events. In this work, we propose a context-aware framework to accurately predict event-triggered abnormal crowd traffic by explicitly modeling event contexts and their impact. We start by training a state-of-the-art spatiotemporal multi-graph model (MG) leveraging a multi-graph convolutional network (MGCN) to model city-wide venues and their connections, as well as gated recurrent unit (GRU) to capture the crowd traffic patterns within venues. In order to model the time-occasional impact of sudden influential event context (e.g., weather conditions), we propose a multi-task fusion diagram to co-train the MG model by learning a temporal impact embedding with an attention mechanism and recurrent neural network to obtain the MG-MT model. In order to model the hyper-space impact of irregularly distributed event context (e.g., epicenters and trajectories), we propose a multi-view fusion diagram to fine-tune the above-mentioned model by learning a spatial impact graph with a stimulus-response mechanism to obtain the spatiotemporal crowd traffic model (STORM).

Goals: This study aimed to develop an innovative soundscape quality index that concurrently evaluates quietness and naturalness in urban soundscapes. Our objectives included conducting urban soundscape quality mapping, analyzing influential mechanisms, and identifying priority zones for sound environment management. Approaches: We collected sound pressure level (SPL) and raw audio data, from which we computed a normalized difference soundscape index (NDSI). With a dataset comprising 28 explanatory variables encompassing land use, built environment, vegetation characteristics, and temporal factors, we employed the random forest (RF) model to predict 10 indicators, including eight SPL-related indices, NDSI, and the QNS (quietness and naturalness soundscape) index. Crucially, we utilized SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to interpret the RF model. Findings: Spatial variations in quietness and naturalness were evident, closely associated with road networks and vegetation, respectively, with discernible temporal variations. The top three variables influencing QNS were distance to major roads, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and proportion of tree coverage. Moreover, interaction effects highlighted dual negative or synergistic promoting effects on QNS from factors such as road width, human disturbance, vegetation configurations, and land cover. Notably, these mechanisms were successfully applied to six typical tourist attractions in Xiamen city, where five types of management zones were mapped based on priority considerations of population density and soundscape quality. Interestingly, natural soundscape reserves were highly correlated with city parks, high-risk zones predominantly overlapped with road networks, and potential zones comprised inner communities between streets.

Therefore, it is expected that the spaces manifesting these religious ceremonies align with their ritual functions and that the deterioration, decay, and decline of these ritual axes would significantly impact the quantity and quality of solidarity, sense of belonging, identity, and more. Research objective: This study aims to identify the role of ritual-centric axes as drivers of regeneration Research method: The study employs explanatory methods based on novel future study techniques. The factors were evaluated by 30 urban planning experts using environmental scanning and cross-impact/structural analysis. The specialized future studies' software, MICMAC, was used to identify the functionality of the ritual axis as a driver for urban regeneration. Conclusion: The results indicate that the dispersion of the influential variables suggests system instability. Out of 29 factors analyzed, 10 key factors were identified as critical influencers on the ritual-centric axis, consistently appearing in both direct and indirect methods. These key factors-alignment with historical context, sense of place, dynamism and sustainability, physical continuity, mental role creation, environmental signification, organization derived from religion and culture, physical-social continuity, significantly improve the quality of interactions and solidarity among individuals with the environment.",Urban Regeneration,Driver,Ritual-Centric Functionality,Culture-Based,,,BAGH-E NAZAR,Zanjan City.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Taking 366 cities in China as an example, this study proposed a novel research framework for analyzing the spatiotemporal characteristics of intercity population flows. Using AutoNavi population migration big data sets from web crawling, the spatiotemporal structure patterns of intercity travel in China from January 1st to June 30th, 2020 were extracted by using the singular value decomposition (SVD) method. Then the spatial organization patterns of intercity travel networks in China and its five major urban agglomerations were identified by the weighted stochastic block model (WSBM). The results showed that the total volume of intercity travel in China and its five major urban agglomerations experienced a process of rapid decline followed by a slow recovery, presenting a ""Vshaped"" distribution since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Three distinctive intercity travel patterns, namely the stable, holiday, and weekday-weekend intercity trip patterns, were extracted from the spatiotemporal OD matrix of intercity travel. Strong intercity travels were mainly distributed in eastern and central China, forming an intercity travel pattern in which core cities pushed and pulled each other within the national urban agglomerations. However, intercity migration flows were dominated by weak-intensity flows. Intercity trips during the holidays had a phenomenon of ""escaping from the metropolis"". Meanwhile, it had significant spatial proximity and directionality. The daily intercity trips were characterized by a remarkable periodicity with seven days as a repeat. A more interesting finding is that when weekends overlap with holidays, intercity travel on the 1-2 days before the vacations has presented an effect of ""suppression travel"". Furthermore, at the national scale, the stable intercity travel network has formed a polycentric core-periphery structure of ""Three Cores-Six Semiperipheries-Five Peripheries"". At the urban agglomeration scale, they formed respectively distinguished monocentric, bicentric, and polycentric core-periphery structures.",Intercity travel,Spatiotemporal pattern,Singular value decomposition (SVD),Weighted stochastic block model (WSBM),,,CITIES,COVID-19,AutoNavi migration index (AMI),China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While its effects on urban economic efficiency and environmental emissions have been investigated, the agricultural system, which plays a pivotal role in ensuring food security, remains an underexplored domain. To address this, this study commences by discussing the possible influence of regional integration on agricultural production drawing from literature and practical evidence. Then the regional integration level of the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration (YRDUA) from 2005 to 2019 was evaluated, which is a facet that has received limited quantitative scrutiny hitherto. Subsequently, the agricultural production efficiency (APE) that integrates the composite inputs and outputs information was analyzed to assess the utility of rural production. The interconnection between these two systems was then explored by panel Tobit Model. The findings reveal that (1) regional integration in the YRDUA has exhibited fluctuation across different developmental stages and is presently converging toward a state of stability. (2) The APE appears better performance characterized by weakened spatial heterogeneity and long-term growth. (3) The APE presents an increase in response to the improved integration levels within the gradients, and the model results suggest a positive relationship between them.

The administration of urban heritage preservation (UHP) requires effective methods, as well as sufficient material and human resources. The administrative practice of UHP is embedded in the relevant regulatory framework, which comprises legislative and normative acts at municipal, national, and international levels. The scale and range of heritage objects to be monitored, the complex statutory basis of the regulatory framework, and the traditionally low human and material resources of city administrations all contribute to the ineffectiveness of UHP practice in the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Vilnius. Advances in technologies such as 3D spatial scanning and AI-based image processing offer the promise of a technological fix to the ineffective administrative practice. In this paper, we present a grounded design study aimed at developing a technology prototype for an automated urban heritage risk monitoring tool. Originally conceived as a techno-fix to the inefficiency of administrative practice, the prototype development reveals tensions and stumbling blocks within digitalisation efforts. Using the analytical lens of the Trifecta model of ITbased regulation, the case study examines the interaction between technological and administrative domains in shaping technology design choices. Based on this case study, we critique the notion that IT is perceived as capable of providing ""techno-fix"" solutions to tasks requiring reflective human decision-making, especially when such solutions are expected to be effective without first redesigning the entire organisational system.

In the eastern US, the wildland-urban interface (WUI), where wildfire risk is greatest, has expanded tremendously over the last three decades. Aims This study aimed to understand how increasing wildfires in the eastern US are manifesting in the WUI. Methods We quantified WUI growth and characterised large (>200 ha) wildfire regimes inside and outside the WUI at multiple spatial scales across the eastern US between 1986 and 2021. Key results WUI wildfires in the eastern US comprised 45% of all large wildfires and 55% of the area burned, were on average 46% larger than non-WUI wildfires, and are becoming more frequent in spring. Most increases in wildfire number and area burned occurred outside of the WUI. Conclusion The WUI plays an important role in large wildfire dynamics in the eastern US; however, increases in the number of large wildfires have occurred primarily outside the WUI. Implications Our findings highlight important interactions between human development and large wildfire occurrence in the eastern US and should be used to direct future region-specific assessments of changing wildfire risk.",development,exposure,fire regime,housing growth,,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE,risk,sprawl,urbanisation,wildland fire,wildland-urban interface,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rivers are complex and dynamic ecosystems that transport particles and organic matter from the headwaters through watersheds to the ocean. Changes in land use and the presence of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) increase the risk of plastic contamination. Simultaneously, hydromorphological features of the watershed can influence the dispersion and retention of microplastics. This study assesses the impact of urban land uses and river hydromorphology on microplastic abundance and spatial distribution in two watersheds with contrasting land uses. Unexpectedly, our findings show that microplastics were widespread throughout watersheds both in water (3.5 +/- 3.3 particles/L) and sediments (56.9 +/- 39.9 particles/g). The concentration of microplastics in sediments significantly increased in granulometry ranging from 0.5 to 1 mm. Microplastics in running waters are significantly correlated with increasing urban land use coverage. However, the presence and distance of WWTPs did not affect microplastic distribution. In conclusion, contrasting patterns were observed for suspended and sedimented microplastic particles: suspended microplastics were associated with an anthropogenic effect, whereas the concentration of microplastics in sediments was determined by riverbed granulometry. Our results suggest that the interaction of anthropogenic and environmental factors shapes microplastic distribution along the rivers and their subsequent transport toward the coastal ocean. Finally, a review of the current literature reveals the absence of standardization in field and laboratory assessment techniques and measurement units, representing a challenge for intercomparisons of river microplastic studies.",Microplastic size,Urban land use,Hydrographic,Water treatment plants,,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Walking, as a core mode of low-carbon urban transport, plays a significant role in the connectivity between stations and urban areas and in the rate of passenger flow dispersal. During peak periods, large volumes of passengers flood the streets, forming complex and diverse walking paths that penetrate urban neighborhoods. Route choice is a complex decision-making process influenced by both subjective and objective factors. Previous studies on pathfinding activities have often focused on either subjective or objective factors in isolation, with limited research on their interaction. This paper establishes a comparative analysis framework based on the translation of subjective and objective information and behavioral feedback mechanisms. Using Lvcuo Station, a transit station on Xiamen's Metro Line 1 in Fujian Province, China, as a case study, we collected walking data from 410 passengers through field surveys. We used the Kappa consistency coefficient test method to analyze the performance of the interaction between the objective environment and subjective environmental cognitive factors when pedestrians exit the rail transit station and walk to their destinations. We also used multinomial logistic regression (MLR) to analyze the correlation between subjective perception variables and objective built environment variables and to consider the influence of individual pedestrian characteristics and attributes on path selection. The results revealed the following: (1) Overall, there is a significant deviation effect of subjective and objective factors on passengers' pathfinding behavior, with some spatial correlation with the built environment of the streets. (2) The consistency of influences on walking activities varies significantly across different travel periods, distances, and purposes. (3) Visual elements, urban life with a bustling atmosphere, street permeability, and route connectivity positively correlate with subjective perception while ""supporting walking facilities"" and ""meeting consumption needs along the way"" negatively correlate with subjective perception.

On the other hand, previous research has shown that exposure to virtual nature environments can restore users' diminished attentional capacities and lead to enhanced cognitive performances. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to investigate if the environment in which the user is redirected has the potential to reduce its cognitive demands.

However, assessments of the response of biological communities to heat waves are often inconclusive. We aimed to assess the responses in abundance, taxonomic and functional diversity indices of stream invertebrate communities to heat waves using long-term monitoring data collected across Europe. We quantified the heat waves' magnitude, analyzed the spatial (i.e., long-term mean) and temporal (anomaly around the long-term mean) components of variation in the magnitude of heat waves, and their interaction with anthropogenic stressors (ecological quality and land cover). For the spatial component of variation, we found a negative association of the community indices to the increasing magnitude of heat waves. Sites undergoing heat waves of higher magnitude showed fewer species and lower trait diversity compared with sites experiencing lower magnitude heat waves. However, we could not detect an immediate temporal response of the communities to heat waves (i.e., the temporal component). Furthermore, we found that the effects of heat waves interacted with the ecological quality of the streams and their surrounding land cover. Diversity declined with increasing heat waves' magnitude in streams with higher ecological quality or surrounded by forest, which may be due to a higher proportion of sensitive species in the community. Heat waves' impacts on diversity were also exacerbated by increasing urban cover. The interaction between heat waves' magnitude and anthropogenic stressors suggests that the effects of extreme events can compromise the recovery of communities. Further, the predicted increase in heat waves will likely have long-term effects on stream invertebrate communities that are currently undetected.",Invertebrates,Functional diversity,Heat waves,Spatio-temporal analysis,,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,Taxonomic diversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the increasing interactions between power distribution networks and natural gas networks bring new challenges to the fast recovery of energy systems. Mobile emergency resources, such as repair crews (RCs), play an essential role in the restoration. However, power distribution networks and gas networks have geographical correlations with transportation systems in urban areas, therefore, there exists spatial interdependency between infrastructural systems. This property results in the dependency between RCs' routings and road states in transportation systems. To this end, this paper proposes a sequential restoration model for power-gas-transportation distribution networks. The post-disaster restoration model contains the dispatch of both RCs and fixed resources. The spatial interdependency is modeled by modified Boolean logic equations to obtain feasible recovery schedules in practice.

The literature on CIM has focused more on its predictors than its outcomes, and few existing reviews have primarily explored its contribution to children's physical well-being. The aim of this review is to analyze studies on the relation between CIM, particularly in (sub)urban neighborhoods, and children's psychological well-being variables. Methods: A literature search run in nine electronic databases resulted in the selection of a final sample of 23 studies, out of 358 initial relevant hits. Peer-reviewed articles addressing at least one child psychological outcome of CIM, referring to (sub)urban residential areas, and considering children and adolescents from school-age throughout adolescence, were analysed. Results: The reviewed studies, published between 1999 and 2020, were mainly conducted in Europe and by quantitative design, and most of them focused on the consequences of CIM for children and adolescents up to 15 years old. Findings suggest a prevalence of studies exploring CIM's benefits for their socio-emotional (e.g., lower fear of crime, enhanced sociability) followed by cognitive (e.g., better spatial knowledge) development. Conclusions: Empirical studies on psychosocial outcomes of CIM are lacking, possibly due to the decline of this activity among children and youth also related to generalised lockdown affecting those specially in (sub)urban neighbourhoods. Moreover, this review shows that psychological benefits of CIM for children have been under looked in the literature and highlights that children's cognitive abilities (ex. spatial cognition) and socio-emotional growth (ex. social interaction skills) may be enhanced through this activity, emphasising the need for more empirical research on this topic.",Children's independent mobility (CIM),Cognitive development,Emotional development Child,Child,"Guicciardi, Marco",,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT & HEALTH,Quality of life,Neighbourhood,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chemical transport models such as Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) and Weather Research and Forecasting Modeling with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) provide fundamental insights into the behavior of atmospheric pollutants but face limitations in spatial resolution and prediction accuracy. Machine learning combined with low-cost sensors can improve prediction accuracy compared to numerical models, but uneven sensor distribution may result in biased prediction results. To address these limitations, this study introduces an innovative framework that leverages a quadtree space division to refine the numerical simulations of air pollutants into higher spatial resolutions by dynamically adjusting grid sizes based on the distribution of increased sensor deployments. Using a variable-resolution grid, the study first aggregates variables into a grid and then calculates spatial dependence based on grid cells. The deep-learning-based Time Series Transformer model is then used to perform detailed temporal predictions of PM 2.5 concentration across the entire grid. The spatial and temporal modeling framework is designed to use the past 48 h' aggregated data, including meteorological variables from WRF-Chem numerical simulation and PM 2.5 concentrations from ground monitoring stations and sensors, to predict future 48-h' PM 2.5 concentrations and tested across entire grids within Los Angeles County from January to June 2020.

In this study, 155 tourist towns in Fujian Province were selected as samples to analyze spatiotemporal differentiation using the geographical concentration index, nearest neighbor index, and local correlation index. Then, a geographic detector model was used to detect the factors that influence the spatiotemporal differentiation of tourist towns and to analyze the explanatory power and interaction of these detection factors. Finally, the mechanisms underlying the detection factors were discussed. Factors affecting the spatiotemporal differentiation of tourist towns in Fujian Province were core factors of traffic network, level of urbanization and population distribution; important factors of industrial structure and socioeconomic basis; and a fundamental factor of policy guidance. These six factors interacted to jointly affect the spatiotemporal differentiation of tourist towns in Fujian Province.

We focus on simple transport -health interactions between switching between car and bus: the exposure to activity and pollution linked to these modes and how these changes effect health status, which in turn influences the mode choice. Methods: We identify a basic causal loop diagram of key conceptual feedback between mode choice and health status (related to exposure to activity and pollution). From this we build a simple system dynamics stock and flow simulation model, with data input from spatial microsimulation synthetic populations derived from 'track and trace ' data as the output from an agent-based model. We then analyse scenarios of mode shift incentivised by bus fare reduction and bus frequency increase. Results: In the tested scenarios of this novel modelling approach, we identify that a reduction in bus fare or increase in bus frequency could incentivise a shift from car to bus which would result in a small decrease in relative risk of all causes mortality. Reducing bus fare in particular could provide both health and financial benefits for the most deprived communities. Conclusions: This modelling approach presented in this data is a promising new method for the study of complex transport -health interactions. From our prototype model we have identified the impacts of mode shift on health status through exposure to pollution and activity, using unique feedbacks that are unaccounted for in conventional models.",Transport,Health,System dynamics,Causal loop diagram,"Shepherd, Simon","Hodgson, Frances C.",JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT & HEALTH,Spatial microsimulation,Agent-based modelling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Throughout those three days in October, in the congress we analyzed in detail the situations of subjects, communities and rural geographies, situations that tend to be actively ignored in a spatial present that finds globalization, the hyper-densification of the main urbanmetropolitan areas, and the forced emptying of rural geographies, as one of their conflict frameworks. These analyzes delved into the specific needs of these communities, shedding light on their challenges, and offering a critical perspective on the complexity of the interaction between rural and urban areas. From these concerns, the VIII Congress was articulated as a platform through which to celebrate the diversity of emerging philosophical discourses produced within the frameworks of what is commonly understood as << rural >>, recognizing its crucial importance in the construction of a comprehensive dialogue about the challenges that define our present; and this monograph is the result of that exchange of knowledge.",Ruralities,Philosophical Thought,Asturian Philosophy Society,Congress,,,EIKASIA-REVISTA DE FILOSOFIA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, current research primarily focuses on quantifying the risk of urban heat based on LST, Ta, etc., overlooking the crucial and intimate influence of continuous intense solar radiation on human thermal comfort and health. Simultaneously, there is a lack of smaller units to support more precise planning. This study utilized the radiant heat stress intensity (RHSI) metric concentrating on the intensity and duration of thermal radiation, to develop a thermal-radiation induced health risk (TIHR) assessment system. Leveraging technologies such as the SOLWEIG model, Python, BERT, and GIS enables precise calculations of 12 spatial indices, including RHSI and Weibo heat. This facilitates a more accurate assessment of health risks at the smallest urban units (blocks) and directly guides planning. The application of this workflow in the case of Suoyuwan, Dalian, China, confirms its value, as it can be used to determine which blocks should be prioritized for specific aspects of risk prevention and control. The results show that some blocks exhibited differences in TIHR even within close proximity, with disaster-causing factors varying according to locations.

Urbanization can directly cause habitat loss and intensify interactions between wildlife due to habitat loss. Here we focus on a threatened flagship species, Chinese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla), in the eastern forests of Shenzhen, a megacity in China. We first conducted field surveys to uncover its fresh (used within a year) and abandoned burrows (unused > a year) and surrounding habitat characteries (elevation, slope, canopy closure, vegetation cover). We then deployed camera traps near the burrows to monitor the daily activities of the Chinese pangolin and sympatric species, and anthropogenic activities. These data were finally used to predict changes in habitat distributions/uses with species distribution models, and to statistically analyze the spatio-temporal relationships between the Chinese pangolin and its potential threats. We found the suitable habitats of pangolin burrows have been halved over the recent decade. In contrast to abandoned burrows, fresh burrows were more likely to be found at higher altitudes (200-500 m) and closer to reservoirs (300-500 m). Pangolins had strong spatial avoidance to presences of humans and domestic dogs, and reduced activities outside when potential predators were most active. We suggest that mitigating human disturbances in the eastern forests is crucial for the maintenance and recovery of the pangolin population in Shenzhen. Our study is among the first to shred a light on the impact of urban expansion on the Chinese pangolins and provides habitat maps and ecological knowledge of the Chinese pangolin for the forest restorations and conservation planning in Shenzhen.",Behavior adaptation,Human disturbance,Species distribution model,Threatened species,"Hu, Xijin","Zhang, Lu",GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,Urban expansion,,,,,,,,"Wang, Yingyong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On this basis, the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics and main influencing factors of the coupling relationship between urbanization and ecological resilience were systematically explored using a coupling coordination model and panel Tobit regression model. The results can be summarized as follows: (1) from 2005 to 2020, the quality of urbanization in the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration continued to grow, the level of ecological resilience grew slowly and fluctuated, and the development among municipalities tended to be balanced. (2) The overall coupling coordination degree of urbanization and ecological resilience showed a continuous increasing trend, and the coupling coordination type changed from basic coupling coordination to good coupling coordination. The number of cities with lagging urbanization quality decreased significantly; spatially, the gap in the coupling coordination degree between municipalities narrowed, and the cities with good coupling gradually clustered. (3) The results of the panel Tobit regression showed that the differences in the spatial evolution of coupling coordination mainly resulted from the interaction of drivers such as real utilized foreign capital, per capita GDP, carbon emission intensity, the proportion of science and technology expenditure to fiscal expenditure, the ratio of per capita disposable income of urban and rural residents, fixed asset investment in municipal utility construction, and the index of ecological land area ratio. In the future, the coupling coordination degree of urbanization and ecological resilience should be improved based on the type of coupling coordination according to local conditions, and the seven influencing factors should be carefully examined to accelerate the high-quality integrated development of the Yangtze River Delta.",urbanization quality,ecological resilience,coupling coordination,influencing factors,,,LAND,Panel Tobit regression mode,Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, whether, how and to what extent aerosols and urbanization, as the two main influencing factors of urban extreme precipitation, have affected this highly damaging extreme event remains largely unexplored. Here, we employed the weather research and forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) and a single-layer urban canopy model to investigate the influences of urbanization, aerosols and their interactions on this extreme precipitation event. We found that the joint intensification effects of urbanization and aerosols on extreme precipitation events greatly enhance its negative influence on megacities. The results indicate that aerosols are enhanced by increasing cloud droplet numbers, thereby intensifying the feedback between precipitation and latent heating. Consequently, the total precipitation increased by 22.6%, raising the precipitation in the Beijing area increase by at least 50 mm. By stimulating atmospheric instability and strengthening vertical air motion (over 0.25 m s(-1)), the urban heat island effect considerably influences the temporal and spatial distributions of extreme precipitation events, resulting in an increase in warm cloud precipitation (80%) and a decrease (30%) in frontal precipitation. Consequently, joint intensification effects resulted in more concentrated precipitation in the southwest of Beijing, leading to a substantial increase (more than 40%, similar to 80 mm). This condition may be an important reason for the most severe disasters in the southwest of Beijing.",WRF-Chem,Extreme precipitation,North China,Aerosols,"Lai, Shen","Dong, Wen-Jie",ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH,Urbanization,,,,,,,,"Huang, Jian-Ping",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study examines the hurricane's ecological repercussions by analyzing tree cover in the municipality of Ponce, southern Puerto Rico. Our primary focus is on the changes in tree cover, encompassing urban, coastal, and rural areas, from before to after the hurricane. Utilizing high- resolution spatial imagery and remote sensing techniques, we map and compare vegetation cover in 2016 (pre-Hurricane Maria) and 2018 (post-Hurricane Maria). The study covers three landscapes of Ponce, from the north, center, and south of the municipality, offering a comprehensive understanding of the hurricane's impact on different landscapes. The findings reveal profound alterations in tree cover, with specific attention to the urban, coastal, and rural zones. In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, the North/ Rural zone witnessed substantial decreases of 14.73% in tree cover. The Center/Urban zone displayed a mix of trends, highlighting the complex interaction between urbanization and hurricane impacts. Coastal areas in the South/Coast zone exhibited diverse impacts, emphasizing the need for conservation and restoration strategies. Detailed insights into specific neighborhoods underscore the localized social impacts of Hurricane Maria. Located in the northern region of the municipality, Guaraguao's negative change in tree cover may translate into reduced biodiversity and ecosystem services. Urban neighborhoods, such as San Ant & oacute;n, experienced considerable negative changes, indicating challenges such as increased heat stress and decreased aesthetic value.

This approach is based on a 1D-2D hydrodynamic and water quality dynamic bidirectional coupling model: GAST-SWMM. The calculation accuracy of the GAST two-dimensional road NPS wash-off model is validated via comparison with experimental data. The obtained Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) is greater than 0.8. Moreover, the model was used to simulate the NPSs in a densely populated urban region of Xi'an, China, lacking building community pipeline data. The NPS pollutant transport and fate under the influence of both road runoff and the building community hydrodynamic water quality during rainfall events with a specific return period were examined. The proposed model can effectively and accurately replicate the accumulation and removal of NPS pollutants on a two-dimensional road and their dynamic interaction with the drainage network. With increasing rainfall return period, the peak time of the surface contaminant total load is postponed. The maximum surface pollutant load durations during rainfall events with 2-, 10-, and 50-year return periods are 60, 75, and 80 min, respectively. During the peak surface pollutant load time, the overflow pollutant fraction can exceed 85% for a 50-year rainfall return period. The simulation method presented in this paper accurately captures the spatial and temporal variations in NPS pollutants in densely populated urban areas, even when pipe network data for building communities are lacking.

A key component of this vision is the upgrading of the Port of Mombasa, the largest and busiest port in East Africa, to international logistics standards. Analyzing the implementation of the Mombasa Port Development Program (MPDP), this article argues that it reveals a transformation of the politics of 'gatekeeping' - understood as the political contests around the spatial and institutional sites that mediate the circulation of resources between domestic and international political-economic spheres. The controversies surrounding the management of the MPDP reveal how gatekeeping has undergone a process of decentralization, that results in arenas of gatekeeper competition multiplying at the intersection of new institutional and spatial sites of political contestation. The article demonstrates how gatekeeping now increasingly encompasses complex interactions between peripheral city-level actors and international state and non-state actors. Spatially, it emphasizes how gatekeeping contests crystallize around Mombasa's logistics sector, due to the port city's position as a crucial gateway linking the hinterland to global trade networks. This, I argue, is transforming Mombasa into a gatekeeper city understood as an urban space of transboundary logistical entanglements, where a variety of spatial practices encounter, and reconfigure the modalities of gatekeeping.",Infrastructure,Mombasa,Kenya,Gatekeeper state,,,POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY,Port,Gatekeeper city,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To this end, we propose Convolution Augmented Graph Sampling Transformer Network (CASTNet) for accurate traffic flow prediction. Specifically, we design a hybrid graph transformer module to utilize the graph convolutions to perceive local structural details, which are incorporated into the transformer to augment the attention computation for more accurate global dependency modeling. Moreover, we develop a sampling-based attention layer based on the approximated sampling strategy to further optimize the graph structure, which is implemented with linear complexity.

Moreover, the welfare and distributional impacts of pricing have largely been studied in the context of passenger travel whereas freight has received relatively less attention. In this paper, we examine the impacts of several congestion pricing schemes on both passenger transport and freight in an integrated manner using a large-scale microsimulator (SimMobility) that explicitly simulates the behavioral decisions of the entire population of individuals and business establishments, dynamic multimodal network performance, and their interactions. Through simulations of a prototypical North American city, we find that a distance-based pricing scheme yields larger welfare gains than an area-based scheme, although the gains are a modest fraction of toll revenues (around 30%). In the absence of revenue recycling or redistribution, distancebased and cordon-based schemes are found to be particularly regressive. On average, lower income individuals lose as a result of the scheme, whereas higher income individuals gain. A similar trend is observed in the context of shippers - small establishments having lower shipment values lose on average whereas larger establishments with higher shipment values gain.

However, the question remains as to where moped users should ride-as they often compete for space with other sustainable modes such as cycling or walking. This study focuses on the Netherlands, known as a cycling paradise, where mopeds share the cycling infrastructure. This has sparked controversies about spatial conflicts between moped users and cyclists, especially since the emergence of e-moped rental systems in 2017. Drawing on mobility studies and social identity theory, this paper explores the stereotypes of moped users and their behaviours to understand the spatial complexities of a shift towards more micromobility in the Netherlands. By analysing interviews with moped users and how users are discussed in the press, the paper empirically maps stereotypes of the users of different mopeds i.e. (1) fuel-based and privately owned, (2) electric and privately owned, and (3) electric and rental, and their behaviour on the bicycle path. Our study shows how debates tend to focus on the behaviours of moped users and their interactions with cyclists on shared bicycle paths while the spatial domination of automobility remains unchallenged. This paper contributes to transport behaviour research on spatial conflicts and identities in the context of the rise of micromobility - a key pillar of transitions to more sustainable mobility, alongside other changes such as fleet electrification, reduction of car use, and increased public transport uptake. Micromobilities entail what was traditionally understood as active mobility or non-motorised transport, such as cycling, but also what is now often discussed under the umbrella of MaaS or (light) electric vehicles, such as motorised two-wheelers, and also 'hybrids' such as e-bikes, fatbikes or cargo bikes.

This study conducted research on land use conflict and zoning control with a view to contributing new ideas for the prevention and resolution of land use risks. By analyzing the positioning and drawing upon fundamental theories, a novel research paradigm was proposed. An empirical study was conducted in the Gan River Basin in Jiangxi Province by applying the comprehensive evaluation method and geographical detector, and the basin was divided into six types of zones according to the intensity of land use conflict and the hierarchy of ecosystem service values. The results of the empirical study showed that the areas of intense conflict, low conflict and weak conflict accounted for 1.57%, 29.16% and 69.26% of the basin area, respectively. Of the intense conflict areas, 4.42% of the areas in the lower Gan River Basin were in intense conflict, while only 0.37% of the right bank of the middle reaches was in intense conflict. The driving factor analysis showed that precipitation, the population density and policy planning had a greater influence on land use conflict and that land use conflict was more likely to occur with the interaction of precipitation and the nighttime light index, population density and NDVI. The superimposed image analysis revealed that the land use conflict was intense at the junctions of urban areas and cropland and at the junctions of cropland and forests in the middle and upper reaches of the basin, which were mainly caused by the demand for urban expansion and the spread of agricultural production areas. The results of this empirical study are in agreement with the actual situation in the Gan River Basin, proving that the research paradigm proposed in this study is scientific and applicable. Moreover, we emphasize that this paradigm can be adapted in its application according to different research objects and continuously improved in response to the evolution of the territorial spatial management system.

However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies analyzing the movement direction and factor interaction of extreme heat events in different regions of China. Based on daily temperature data from 2252 meteorological stations in China from 1980 to 2021, three extreme heat indicators were calculated: Hot days (SU35), Tropical nights (TR20), and Extreme maximum temperature (TXx). The study updated and compared the characteristics of spatiotemporal evolution and driving factors of extreme heat events in China and its seven geographical regions. The results show that: (1) SU35 and TR20 increase faster in summer, while TXx increases faster in winter. Nighttime high -temperature events have increased at a faster rate. (2) Extreme heat events in North, Northeast, and Northwest China have gradually moved southward and eastward, while in Central, East, and South China, such events have moved northward. (3) In northeast and northwest China, the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) is a strong driving force for extreme heat events, while urbanization is the most potent driving force in the remaining regions. The interaction between urbanization and atmospheric circulation, including AMO, Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and East Atlantic/West Russia (EA/WR), is non-linear or double factor enhancement and exhibits significant spatial heterogeneity.

Nevertheless, the discourse on children's well-being has primarily been shaped by adults, often overlooking the unique needs and perspectives of younger populations. This interdisciplinary study located in Berlin, Germany, conducted by educational scientists, planners, and architects, challenges this by directly engaging with children through game-based data collection combined with ethnographic research to explore their well-being needs. From children's centers and schools to digital worlds, neighborhoods, and interactions with crime, children clearly articulate where, how, when, and with whom they create moments of well-being. The findings highlight the importance of children's centers as well-being hubs, offering insights into how well-being can be nurtured through both physical design and programmatic offerings tailored to children's needs. A key insight is the role of religious places and family practices, alongside micro-spaces and translocal references provided by neighborhood spaces, in shaping children's sense of identity and well-being. Additionally, the importance of having access to digital spaces is emphasized by the children. The study contributes to the discourse on child-friendly cities by advocating for multi-scalar planning and design approaches. The research calls for urban planners and designers to integrate children's perspectives to design spaces that accommodate the full spectrum of children's well-being needs, including micro-scale interventions and flexible, child-responsive interior designs.",architecture,built environment,child-friendly city,children's center,,,URBAN PLANNING,digital mediatization,micro-spaces,multi-scalar,translocal,urban design,well-being,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The development of rapid and timely water-quality assessment tools using easily measured variables is essential for the health management of urban water bodies. In this study, we focused on the dissolved oxygen (DO) of Baiyangdian Lake using 251 sets of empirically measured water quality data and corresponding Sentinel-2 satellite images. Nine machine learning algorithms were then used to develop a rapid detection algorithm for the spatial distribution of the DO concentration in Baiyangdian Lake. This study successfully applied these methods to invert the DO concentration in Baiyangdian Lake during spring, summer, and autumn. The results indicated that extra tree regression (ETR) provided the most accurate and stable results for inverting the DO concentration among the nine machine learning methods. In contrast, AdaBoost regression (ABR), Bayesian ridge regression (BRR), and support vector machines (SVM) exhibit relatively poor regression performance and lack sensitivity to DO concentrations. Moreover, the DO concentration in Baiyangdian Lake ranged from approximately 0 to 12 mg/L, with notable spatiotemporal variations. The highest overall DO concentration was observed in the spring, particularly in the southern region. The DO concentration significantly decreased during summer compared to that in spring, with higher values in the southwestern area and lower values in the northern region. The DO concentration reached its lowest value in autumn, with slightly higher values in the southern region. This study focused on the estimation and inversion of DO concentrations in the water bodies of Baiyangdian Lake. By introducing and comparing the performances of commonly used machine learning models, a rapid estimation of the DO concentration was achieved, thereby overcoming the limitations of traditional water quality monitoring methods in DO inversion. It not only intuitively explained the temporal and spatial variation patterns of DO concentration but also laid a foundation for further in-depth exploration of the interactions between DO and other water quality parameters.",Dissolved oxygen (DO),Sentinel-2 MSI,Machine learning,Water quality monitoring,"Wu, Yue","You, Xiaogang",ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS,Baiyangdian Lake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we innovatively consider the interaction between heterogeneous traffic flow as well as the mutual effect of traffic flow on different lanes and develop a hybrid model based on deep learning for urban expressway lane-level mixed traffic flow prediction, including three modules. First, the feature selection module is applied to screen the features with a high spatio-temporal correlation to the prediction object and construct the input matrix. Then, it is input to the feature attention module to quantify the importance of the input features on the prediction object, thereby assigning attention weights. Finally, the spatio-temporal information fusion module is adopted to capture the global spatio-temporal dynamics of traffic flow at horizontal and vertical spatial scales, as well as learn the complex coupling characteristics of heterogeneous traffic flow, thus obtaining predictions. An urban expressway mixed traffic flow simulation environment is built to collect experimental datasets for prediction accuracy evaluation.

Integrating shared micromobility with public transit offers opportunities to complement fixed-route transit networks and address first- and last-mile issues. To explore this topic, a systematic literature review was conducted to consolidate knowledge, analyze research achievements and best practices, and provide future research recommendations. This study examined 108 journal papers from the Web of Science (WoS) core collection from 2016 to 2022, along with grey literature. Citation and co-citation analyses were performed to build and illustrate the literature's bibliometric networks. This analysis categorized the literature into four major study themes: policy, sustainability, the interaction between shared micromobility and public transportation, and infrastructure. The implementation approaches of integrating shared micromobility and public transportation in different cities were classified into four categories: physical integration, payment and fee integration, informational integration, and institutional integration. The findings indicate that the relationship between shared micromobility and public transportation varies with spatial-temporal conditions and the population density of the city. Overall, integrating micromobility into public transit can offer faster and more cost-effective mobility options for most trips, contributing to urban resilience, a better air quality, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and livable communities. Based on these insights, further research is recommended to explore dynamic and context-specific strategies for successful shared micromobility and public transit integration, considering diverse urban settings and demographic factors.",public transportation,shared mobility,citation analysis,co-citation analysis,,,SUSTAINABILITY,urban mobility,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, the spatial distribution characteristics of influencing factors on ecological environment quality were studied using the Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression Model (MGWR). The results indicate that seven influencing factors including Elevation, Population, Precipitation, TEMP, TMMX, TMMN, and Slope have clear causal relationships with EEQ and exhibit bidirectional coupling relationships. There exist complex causal relationships among influencing factors, revealing the interaction mechanisms and causal pathways among multiple factors in the ecological environment system.

The significance of this research lies in its applicability to real-time urban planning through a web application, where traditional simulation methods prove too time-consuming. Our methodology involves a two -stage neural network approach, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained on a simulated dataset constructed with realistic subsurface flow parameters extracted from borehole measurements in the Munich region. The research process is systematically structured into stages: the first stage rapidly predicts the general shape of a single heat pump's plume in the absence of other influences. Building upon this, the second stage refines predictions by incorporating the interactions with neighboring heat plumes. Both stages employ CNNs, allowing for efficient training and evaluation. Experiments are conducted on dataset sizes of 100 and 1000 data points and on input parameters, focusing on a reduced dataset with data points of a spatial size of 256x16 pixels. The dataset is split into 70% training, 20% validation and 10% test data. Our results showcase the effectiveness of our approach, achieving a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of approximately 0.1 degrees C in both stages. This level of accuracy demonstrates the viability of our two -stage model in capturing the complex dynamics of GHWP interactions in shallow aquifers.

However, most of the current studies on ES supply-demand relationships focus on spatial mismatches and rarely consider their temporal dynamics. In this study, the year-byyear dynamics (2001-2020) of 12 ESs at multiple spatial scales were investigated by using space-time interaction (STI) analysis, fuzzy C-mean clustering, and emerging hotspot analysis. We found that (1) three forms of temporal dynamics of ES indicators can be identified, including linear dynamics, fluctuating dynamics, and regime shift dynamics. (2) Temporal dynamic patterns of the same ES were not consistent across all counties, showing great spatial heterogeneity. The temporal dynamics of each ES type at each county were spatially explicitly clustered into linear dynamics, fluctuating dynamics, and regime shift dynamics with different means. (3) The ES supply-demand relationships can shift between supply-demand balance, excess supply, and excess demand when the temporal dynamics of ES supply do not match with that of ES demand. Our results suggest that temporal dynamic analysis in ecological restoration effectiveness assessment can help to avoid erroneous results compared to considering only pre- and post-policy ES changes.

To fill this gap, modeling the environment at a fine resolution brings a significant value, if combined with population-based studies. This is particularly challenging in regions where the availability of both population and environmental data are limited. In low- and middle-income countries, many demographic and health data are from nationally representative household surveys, which now provide approximate geolocations of the sampled households. In parallel, freely available remote sensing data, due to their high spatial and temporal resolution, make it possible to capture the local environment at any time. This study aims to correlate standard demographic and health information with a high-resolution environment characterization derived from satellite data, encompassing both rural and urban areas in Sub-Saharan Africa. We use the malaria indicator survey conducted in 2017-2018 in Burkina Faso. We first present a deep semisupervised domain adaptation strategy based on the intertropical climatic characteristics of the country for precisely mapping local climate zones (LCZs). This strategy models seasonal variations through contrastive learning to extract useful information for the mapping process. We then use this high-resolution LCZ map to characterize, in four groups, the immediate environment of the sampled households. We find a significant association between these local environments and malaria among households' children.

Meanwhile, spatial and temporal heterogeneities often lead to constantly evolving dynamics in in passenger demand, e.g., passengers may exhibit different mobility patterns at different periods or in different regions. Many models fail to capture these heterogeneities and adjust parameters adaptively, leading to suboptimal prediction results. In this paper, we propose a novel space-time adaptive network (STAN) to address these issues. Spatially, an edge-based backbone with a global receptive field is devised. Edge embeddings directly represent pair-wise relations between regions, preserving more fine-grained information and directional interactions. The backbone adaptively updates edge embeddings by fusing static and dynamic information from origin and destination regions, enabling the model to learn intricate spatial relations from simple input data (i.e., basic relation graphs and historical OD matrices). Temporally, a prompter mechanism is proposed to inject temporal information into model parameters, making them timedependent. The parameter values exhibit periodicity and continuity for all periods, meanwhile, they can be adjusted for each specific period. It makes the model time-aware and enables it to identify similar periods and differentiate dissimilar ones during training. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets (i.e., ten-month taxi trips in New York and one-month ride-hailing trips in Ningbo), and the results demonstrate that our model outperforms baseline models and automatically learns certain spatial and temporal semantics.

The study determined bird populations and documented bird behavior using a point count method. The Shannon-Wiener Index value of H ' = 1.536, a richness of SR = 9, an abundance of N = 424 birds, and an evenness value of E = 0.699 indicated poor urban ecosystem health. The most dominant species at feeding locations were the House crow, Rock dove, and Common mynah. Of the 12 types of food offered by humans, rice and bajra (Cenchrus americanus) were the most abundant, while the most unusual foods found were table sugar and makhana. Data analysis showed that birds visited feeding sites along Canal Road based on learned behavior regarding the availability and predictability of food items. A spatial distribution pattern using GIS revealed that more birds were present at feeding spots closer to less noisy green belt areas. Principal component analysis indicated a relationship between bird species and food types showing that wheat was preferred by House crows and Common mynah, while bajra was favored by Rock doves. Interestingly, House sparrows were most commonly found near table sugar scattered on the road. The ecological parameters indicated that the populations of bird species (House crow, Rock dove, Common mynah, etc.) are increasing at feeding spots. This study finds that anthropogenic feeding negatively impacts wild avifauna, leading to long-term implications such as instability in bird populations, changes in foraging behavior, and serious threats to bird health and safety due to vehicular traffic along the roadside.

However, previous measurements of pharmacy access rely on methods that do not capture all aspects of geographic access. Objectives: This study aimed to measure pharmacy access across the contiguous United States and by rural, suburban, and urban areas using drive -time analysis and an improved methodological approach. Methods: The 2 -step floating catchment area method was used to measure pharmacy access by considering the supply capacity of pharmacies, population demand for pharmacies, and the interaction between them within a reasonable travel time range. This method is a methodologically improved approach compared with previous methods for measuring geographic access. Network analysis was used to measure drive time from the population -weighted centroids of census tracts to the geocoded location of community pharmacies. Census tractlevel pharmacy access was measured using a 10- and 20 -minute drive time. Census tracts were also categorized based on population per square mile as rural ( < 1000), suburban (1000300 0), and urban ( > 3000). Results: Across the contiguous United States, 79.9% and 91.1% of census tracts had access to at least 1 pharmacy per 10,000 people within a 10- and 20 -minute drive time, respectively. Rural census tracts had the lowest share of access to at least 1 pharmacy per 10,000 people compared with suburban and urban tracts and for both drive times. Conclusion: Community pharmacies are highly accessible health care access points, specifically in urban and suburban areas.

The relatively successful ability of densely populated cities such as Seoul, Singapore, Tokyo and New York City to manage virus spread supports this. We hypothesise that, given the complexity of the interaction between people and place, the relative contribution of density and crowding to the spread of infectious diseases may be contingent on local factors. To directly compare the role of urban density and household overcrowding, we examine each in relation to COVID-19 incidence in the three largest cities in Australia, Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, as the pandemic unfolded from July 2021 to January 2022. Using ecological models adjusted for spatial autocorrelation and area-level measures of age and socio-economic factors, we assess the association between population density, overcrowding in homes, and COVID-19 infections in local neighbourhoods. Challenging prevailing assumptions, we find evidence for an effect of both density and overcrowding on COVID-19 infections depending on the city and area within cities; that is, depending on the local context. For example, in the southwestern suburbs of Sydney, the case rate decreases by between 0.4 and 6.4 with every one-unit increase in gross density however the case rate increases by between 0.01 and 9.6 with every one-unit increase in total overcrowding.

Accurate identification of SCLU and scientific exploration of its spatiotemporal characteristics of their driving factors are pivotal for regional sustainable development. However, the basic theoretical system of SCLU still needs to be improved, and the spatio-temporal characteristics of SCLU at different spatial scales and landforms as well as the spatio-temporal correlation effects of its driving factors need to be further studied. This study utilizes theoretical models for the identification of SCLU. Employing a comprehensive index approach involving ArcGIS, FRAGSTATS landscape pattern analysis, and the multi-scale geographically weighted regression model, the spatio-temporal characteristics of SCLU are analyzed across different administrative scales and Macro-landforms. The investigation unveils the intrinsic mechanisms of spatio-temporal differentiation driven by various factors from 2000 to 2020 in the arid and semiarid region of Xinjiang, China. Results indicated that: (1) SCLU is a sensitive indicator of human-land interaction, measurable using conflict risk and effect; (2) The SCLU in Xinjiang presents a spatial pattern of ""severe conflict around the three mountains and mild conflict around the two basins"" and the SCLU transitioned from an outbreak to a relief stage over the past two decades; (3) SCLU varies significantly among landform types, with conflict intensity in Plain > Mountains > Platform > Hill areas; (4) Elevation and slope in natural environmental factors, human footprint and distance of patches from water, from roads, and from railroads in social activity factors have inhibitory effects on SCLU, and GDP, population density, and human impact index in economic development factors have positive effects on SCLU, and focusing on controlling potentially high-conflict risk areas and enhancing the upgrading of ecological quality are key to mitigating SCLU.

While existing measures of inequality are mostly focused on income and wealth, it is widely recognised that non-monetary disparities such as in health, education, and housing play a crucial role in creating and reinforcing inequalities. Transport plays a central role in mitigating inequalities by enhancing access to employment, education, and essential services. It is also directly and indirectly related to disparities in housing, neighbourhoods, and health. Policymakers increasingly recognize the potential of transport policies in addressing inequalities; however, the effects of interventions need to be understood beyond the transport sector only and should consider wider impacts. In this review, we concentrate on three interlinked sectors - housing, land-use, and transportation - where local governments possess some capacity to influence the processes by which inequalities are created and exacerbated. Currently, empirical research on inequalities within these domains is fragmented. Models and datasets used for scenario testing, planning, and intervention evaluation are often disjointed, sector-focused, and rarely consider distributional effects.

However, there remains scarce information regarding the composition and assembly of both planktonic and benthic bacterial communities as well as pathogen distribution in such environments. In this study, full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing was conducted to investigate the bacterial community composition, interactions, and assembly processes as well as the distribution of potential pathogens along a riverine-coastal continuum in Shenzhen megacity, China. The results indicated that both riverine and coastal bacterial communities were predominantly composed of Gammaproteobacteria (24.8 +/- 12.6 %), Alphaproteobacteria (16.1 +/- 9.8 %), and Bacteroidota (14.3 +/- 8.6 %), while sedimentary bacterial communities exhibited significantly higher diversity compared to their planktonic counterparts. Bacterial community patterns exhibited significant divergences across different habitats, and a significant distance -decay relationship of bacterial community similarity was particularly observed within the urban river ecosystem. Moreover, the urban river ecosystem displayed a more complex bacterial co -occurrence network than the coastal ecosystem, and a low ratio of negative:positive cohesion suggested the inherent instability of these networks. Homogeneous selection and dispersal limitation emerged as the predominant influences on planktonic and sedimentary bacterial communities, respectively. Pathogenic genera such as Vibrio , Bacteroides , and Acinetobacter , known for their roles in foodborne diseases or wound infection, were also identified.

Such datasets are indispensable for a variety of applications, including climate modeling, energy consumption analysis, and socioeconomic activities. Despite the importance of this information, previous studies have primarily focused on estimating building heights regionally at the grid scale, often resulting in datasets with limited coverage or spatial resolution. This limitation hampers comprehensive global analysis and the ability to generate actionable insights at finer scales. In this study, we developed a global building height map at the building footprint scale by leveraging Earth Observation (EO) datasets and advanced machine learning techniques. Our approach integrated multisource remote-sensing features and building morphology features to develop height estimation models using the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) regression method across diverse global regions. This methodology allowed us to estimate the heights of individual buildings worldwide, culminating in the creation of the three-dimensional (3D) Global Building Footprints (3D-GloBFP) dataset for the year 2020. Our evaluation results show that the height estimation models perform exceptionally well at a global scale, with R-2 values ranging from 0.66 to 0.96 and root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) ranging from 1.9 to 14.6 m across 33 subregions. Comparisons with other datasets demonstrate that 3D-GloBFP closely matches the distribution and spatial pattern of reference heights. Our derived 3D global building footprint map shows a distinct spatial pattern of building heights across regions, countries, and cities, with building heights gradually decreasing from the city center to the surrounding rural areas. Furthermore, our findings indicate disparities in built-up infrastructure (i.e., building volume) across different countries and cities. China is the country with the most intensive total built-up infrastructure (5.28x10(11) m(3), accounting for 23.9 % of the global total), followed by the USA (3.90x10(11) m(3), accounting for 17.6 % of the global total).

To get to know the ecological risk situation in Turpan City, China, this study constructed an ecological risk evaluation system to obtain the ecological risk level (ERL) and ecological risk index (ERI) based on the multi-objective linear programming-patch generation land use simulation (MOP-PLUS) model, analyzed the changes in land use and ecological risk in Turpan City from 2000 to 2020, and predicted the land use and ecological risk in 2030 under four different scenarios (business as usual (BAU), rapid economic development (RED), ecological protection priority (EPP), and eco-economic equilibrium, (EEB)). The results showed that the conversion of land use from 2000 to 2030 was mainly between unused land and the other land use types. The ERL of unused land was the highest among all the land use types. The ecological risk increased sharply from 2000 to 2010 and then decreased from 2010 to 2020. According to the value of ERI, we divided the ecological risk into seven levels by natural breakpoint method; the higher the level, the higher the ecological risk. For the four scenarios in 2030, under the EPP scenario, the area at VII level was zero, while the area at VII level reached the largest under the RED scenario. Comparing with 2020, the areas at I and II levels increased under the BAU, EPP, and EEB scenarios, while decreased under the RED scenario. The spatial distributions of ecological risk of BAU and EEB scenarios were similar, but the areas at I and II levels were larger and the areas at V and VI levels were smaller under the EEB scenario than under the BAU scenario. Therefore, the EEB scenario was the optimal development route for Turpan City. In addition, the results of spatial autocorrelation showed that the large area of unused land was the main reason affecting the spatial pattern of ecological risk under different scenarios. According to Geodetector, the dominant driving factors of ecological risk were gross domestic product rating (GDPR), soil type, population, temperature, and distance from riverbed (DFRD). The interaction between driving factor pairs amplified their influence on ecological risk.

This paper investigates mismatches in NbR supply and demand to provide insights for informing spatial and regional planning to achieve sustainable tourism. To this end, the paper uses a wide range of indicators such as biophysical attributes, accessibility and social indicators to map and assess NbR supply and demand, followed by the application of spatial statistics to analyse supplydemand mismatches. Cluster analysis was performed based on the supply -demand relationship to identify a typology of NbR ES across the study area in the north of Iran. The paper proposes an innovative application of recreation ES bundles with potential implications for sustainable tourism in a region marked as a hot spot for tourism. The analysis generated a typology of five bundles of NbR ES with differing recreational opportunities. Bundles 1 and 2, characterized by a supply surplus and substantial ecological value, are suitable for NbR activities such as camping, hiking, climbing, and birdwatching. In contrast, bundle 4 and 5 associated with urban centres, experience a supply deficit, making them less suitable for NbR. Bundle 3, characterized by a mixture of natural and productive lands, plays an important role in maintaining a balanced supply -demand state.

This study evaluates the role of green space systems in mitigating high temperatures and enhancing mental health within the environmental health risk assessment framework. Using CiteSpace software, we analyzed literature from 2001 to 2023, focusing on the interactions among heatwaves, green spaces, and health.

Nevertheless, the impact of pure sea breeze (PSB), characterized by a prevailing wind direction perpendicular to the coastline, on UHI remains rarely unexplored. In this study, the PSB events from 2015 to 2022 in Tianjin are identified using 10-m wind observations, and their occurrence frequency is found to show significant seasonality with least frequency in autumn. Besides, we identify the event of all sea breeze (ASB), as well as the days with non-sea breeze (NSB), and the PSB events are found to only account for about one tenth of ASB events. To analyze the potential impact of PSB on UHI, we propose a term of urban-rural temperature difference (URTD) to represent UHI. This is implemented by calculating the difference of 2-m air temperature (T2m) at the city center station of Tianjin minus T2m at other meteorological stations along both directions: the PSB prevailing direction (PSB_H), and the direction perpendicular to PSB_H (PSB_V). Results show that the URTD in the presence of PSB tends to decline gradually from the coastline to the city center along the PSB_H. In contrast, the URTD doesn't change much along the direction of PSB_V. Shifting focus to the direction of PSB_H, the most pronounced alterations in URTD (upstream minus downstream) are found in the presence of PSB (2.14 degrees C), compared with ASB (0.85 degrees C) and NSB (0.57 degrees C). This indicates that the most substantial variation in URTD from coastline to city center occurs under the influence of PSB compared to others. Finally, a case study by comparing PSB against NSB is conducted, which confirms the above-mentioned phenomena.

To realize the highquality development of the takeaway sector, it is necessary to understand the spatial differentiation characteristics of takeaway consumption in Chinese cities and its influencing factors. To this end, we quantitatively studied the spatial distribution of takeaway consumption in 56 cities. We used the number of takeaway orders (copies/person) and the per capita takeaway consumption amount (RMB/person) in major Chinese cities in 2019 to characterize takeaway consumption in China. We investigated the driving mechanisms and factors affecting takeaway consumption amounts per capita and order per capita in China. The results show that takeaway consumption amounts per capita and order per capita is higher in East China than in North and Central China. The tertiary industry population ratio is crucial to takeaway consumption amounts per capita and order per capita in major Chinese cities. Amounts and orders increase as the tertiary industry population ratio rises. Factors affecting takeaway consumption amounts per capita and order per capita in Chinese cities of different population sizes vary. The working-age population ratio heavily influences the takeaway consumption amounts per capita and orders per capita in megacities. Additionally, internet penetration and average annual temperature play a significant role in takeaway consumption amounts per capita and orders per capita in megalopolis. In big cities I, the road capacity per capita and GDP per capita are the main factors affecting takeaway consumption amounts per capita and orders per capita. The tertiary industry population ratio is the core factor that determines takeaway consumption amounts per capita and orders per capita in big cities II.

However, current disaster prediction and assessment research often neglect the compound effects between multiple geohazards highly in urbanized regions. To address the concern, we employed comparative methodology, evaluating four machine learning algorithms-Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), Back Propagation Neural Network (BP), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-in the creation of Geohazard Susceptibility Maps (GSM) for the highly urbanized Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Additionally, the study investigated the triggering mechanisms and the compound interaction between multiple geohazards using the conditional vine copula model. The results showed that the XGBoost model outperformed other models (AUC = 0.89) for predicting multiple geohazards. Geohazards were predominantly concentrated in urban areas in the GBA, with surface subsidence being the most severe, followed by collapse and landslide. The primary triggers for multigeohazards include distance to roads, slope length, and lithology, with slope length and lithology identified as the primary causative factors in urban areas. Urbanization within the GBA increased the probability of multigeohazards by 10%, compared to their univariate counterparts. Urban regions exhibited increased risks of landslides, surface subsidence, and collapse by approximately 31%, 44%, and 32%, respectively compared to non-urban regions. Additionally, compound geohazards in the GBA were primarily triggered by heavy rainfall, resulting in the formation of landslide-collapse and collapse-landslide geohazard chains. The probability of compound geohazards is approximately 5% lower than that of univariate geohazards. This is because compound geohazards necessitate a higher cumulative rainfall, and the rainfall threshold was approximately 2-3 times higher than that of univariate geohazards. In the cascading hazard pattern, the occurrence of primary geohazards during local heavy rain increased the probability of secondary geohazards by approximately 10%.

Therefore, in this study, two scenarios of natural evolution scenario (NES) and ecological conservation scenario (ECS) were set up based on the development of Mohe City,China. Meanwhile, a coupled model of LUCC and ecosystem carbon storage was established using Logistic-CA-Markov and InVEST models, as well as optimal parameters_based geographical Detector and GeoDa, to predict the distribution and change of ecosystem carbon storage based on LUCC in the future. The effects of different influencing factors on the spatial differentiation of carbon storage were also explored. The results show that: (1) From 1980 to 2020, the land use type in Mohe City was dominated by the forest and its area decreased; the area of wetland increased. From 2020 to 2040, ecological benefits will be shown under the ECS, with an increase in forest and a slower expansion of built-up. (2) Carbon loss in Mohe City from 1980 to 2020 was 4.04Tg.

Understanding the driving factors behind these emissions is crucial for effective pollution control and environmental management. Therefore, this study is an attempt to provide insights into the influence of socioeconomic factors and explore spatial dependencies of NOx emissions in China in 2022 employing spatial regression models (SRMs). Among the SRMs considered, the spatial Durbin model (SDM) is identified as the most suitable for analyzing regional NOx emissions. The study highlights the importance of controlling electricity consumption and vehicle emissions for addressing air pollution in Chinese regions. Specifically, a one billion kilowatt-hour increase in electricity consumption leads to approximately 549.6 tons of NOx emissions, and an increase of 1000 vehicles in a region results in an average increase of 7113.4 tons of NOx emissions in the same region. Furthermore, per capita consumption expenditure (PCEXP) and research and development (R&D) expenditure exhibit negative direct and spillover impacts. Contrary to previous studies, this research finds that changes in urban population density do not have a significant direct or indirect effect on NOx emissions within the studied areas. Moreover, we conducted additional investigations to assess the effectiveness of government action plans in reducing NOx emissions. Specifically, we evaluated the impact of Phases 1 and 2 of the Clean Air Action Plan, launched in 2013 and 2018, respectively, on the socioeconomic drivers of NOx emissions. Therefore, the data were modeled for the years 2013 and 2017 and compared to the results obtained for 2022. The findings indicate that over the entire period (2013-2022), the emission controls mandated by the action plan resulted in significant reductions in the impact of many of the studied NOx drivers.

Leisure walking, as a widely embraced low-cost physical activity, can effectively help reduce the prevalence of chronic diseases and enhance health. Improving the neighborhood built environment may affect the quality of leisure walking, as an activity that depends upon features of the built environment. Methods: Using data from the 2015 China Health and Nutrition Survey, we obtained a sample of 1006 residents from 134 neighborhoods in nine provinces east of the Heihe-Tengchong Line in China. We used logit mixed-effect models and linear mixed-effect models to measure associations between neighborhood built environment characteristics and leisure walking durations within urban, suburban, county-seat, and rural neighborhoods. We differentiated between leisure walking on weekdays and weekends. Results: Residents in rural neighborhoods that had dirt or paved roads had shorter leisure walking durations compared with residents in rural neighborhoods that had mainly gravel roads. Residents in urban neighborhoods that had gyms had shorter leisure walking durations compared with residents in urban neighborhoods for which the nearest gym was outside the neighborhood. The presence of parks did not show any significant association with leisure walking durations in any neighborhood type. The presence of bus stops was associated with greater leisure walking durations in county-seat neighborhoods, as were more restaurants in suburban neighborhoods. Conclusion: Seemingly mundane built environment factors such as road pavement type appeared to be more closely associated with the duration of leisure walking than previously studied parks. Different built environment factors were associated with leisure walking duration within specific neighborhood types. Further research should focus on the characteristics of leisure walking behavior in various spatial contexts and during different time periods to continue to reveal the complex interactions between built environment factors and leisure walking.",Neighborhood,Built environment,Physical activity,Road pavement type,"Moudon, Anne Vernez",,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT & HEALTH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the analysis of the conceptual relationship and interaction mechanism between rurality and poverty, this paper revealed the spatio-temporal pattern evolution characteristics and correlational effects of the rurality index (RI) and poverty governance level (PGL) in 91 counties of the rocky desertification area of Yunnan -Guangxi -Guizhou (RDAYGG) in China from 2005 to 2020 by using the multi -index comprehensive evaluation, Person correlation coefficient, and fixed effects model. The results showed that (1) there are similarities and differences between rurality and poverty. The logic of rurality affecting poverty governance is that the dynamic trade-offs between the share of positive and negative rurality in a region will come to alter the local capacity for urban -rural coordinated development, and the ideal process is manifested in the weakening of negative rurality and the enhancement of positive rurality. (2) From 2005 to 2020, the RI of counties within the RDAYGG showed a pattern of continuous weakening, while the PGL showed a trend of gradual increase in the whole region, and both were holistically characterized by reverse dynamic change. (3) The regional PGL is closely related to the change of rurality. When other influencing factors remain unchanged, for every 10% reduction in the RI, the PGL will increase by about 0.4%.

However, due to higher inter-class similarity and intra-class variability, achieving accurate classification for RSS images poses a considerable challenge for current convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based and visual transformer (ViT)-based methods. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel dual-encoding method named master-slave encoding network (MSE-Net) from two perspectives of feature extraction and fusion. The master encoder, based on ViT, extracts higher-level semantic features, while the slave encoder, based on CNN, captures relative lower-level spatial structure information. Secondly, to integrate feature information from the two encoders effectively, this paper further develop two fusion strategies. The first strategy involves the auxiliary enhancement units (AEUs), which eliminates semantic divergence between the two encoders, enhances spatial context awareness of the slave encoder and promotes effective feature learning. The interactive perception unit (IPU), as the second strategy, facilitates interaction and integration of the two encoders' representations to extract more discriminative feature information. In addition, we conducted comparative experiments on four widely-used RSS datasets, including RSSCN7, SIRI-WHU, the aerial image dataset (AID) and NWPU-RESISC45 (NWPU45), to verify the effectiveness of MSE-Net.

The relationship between LIs and LST in key building patches exhibits diverse characteristics during heat and non-heat waves, so differentiated configuration optimization strategies are required for built environments of different compactness. The interactions of patch configurations also require emphasis, especially the patch complexity.

Tsunamis striking a settlement frequently devastate much of its infrastructure. In instances where infrastructure withstands the tsunami's actions, it acts as a flow resistance for the wave's run-up, altering inundation dynamics and flow depth. Accurately predicting the complex dynamics of tsunami wave run-up in densely populated urban areas is paramount for informing effective evacuation protocols and conducting comprehensive hazard and risk assessments. In pursuit of improving wave run-up prediction capabilities, this study delves into the threedimensional numerical modelling of wave run-up of non-breaking, long tsunami waves in urbanized areas. Leveraging insights from a physical experiment with pump-driven wave generation and idealized infrastructure, a novel pressure-based wave generation boundary condition is developed. The boundary condition achieves an average of 4.9% accuracy in replicating the water surface elevation from experiments. Additionally, it attains an average 1.5% precision in reproducing flow velocities, furthermore reproducing the spatial flow dynamics accurately. Physical experiment wave run-up is modelled with an average 6.9% deviation for both simulations with and without idealized infrastructure. 63.0% higher non-linearity waves than in the physical experiments are additionally investigated to highlight the boundary conditions capabilities of high non-linearity wave generation, change in run-up reduction for higher non-linearity waves for infrastructure interaction and furthermore in-depth flow field characteristics during tsunami inundation. Finally, the study highlights deviations from analytically calculated wave run-up, emphasizing the necessity for numerical and physical experimental evaluation for both high non-linearity waves and tsunami infrastructure interaction, ultimately fostering both resilience and preparedness against tsunami hazards.",Tsunami wave run-up,Tsunami wave-structure interaction,Run-up reduction,Pump-driven wave generation,"Schuerenkamp, David","Goseberg, Nils",COASTAL ENGINEERING,OpenFOAM,RANS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Massive related works about signal timing optimization have been proposed and led to many signal control methods and systems. In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have attracted the increasing attention of researchers in the area of signal control optimization, since they can learn the optimal timing policy themselves by analyzing changing patterns between the traffic condition and signal timing plans. Multi -intersection traffic signal control problems face more challenges than classical single intersection problems such as the dimensionality issue as the joint action space of multiple agents grows exponentially with the number of intersections. The existing state -of -art multi -agent reinforcement learning algorithms developed for other areas may not suit well with traffic signal control given the complex spatial-temporal nature of traffic flows. In this paper, we propose a novel multi -agent counterfactual actor-critic with scheduler (MACS) framework for multiple interactions. In this method, decentralized actors control the traffic signals and the centralized critic combines recurrent policies with feed -forward critics. Additionally, a scheduler module that exchanges information among agents helps the individual agent better understand the entire environment. The proposed method was evaluated using simulation experiments based on a real -world urban street network in Shenzhen, China.

This article introduces a cross-scale functional and structural approach for balancing trade-offs in landscape planning and sustainable land management at multiple levels, based on the principles of multifunctional suitability. Using Heilongjiang Province in China as a case, we simulate four landscape scenarios that progressively consider cross-scale and inter-regional trade-offs more broadly, as well as local suitability. In the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, no multifunctionality objectives are considered at any level; in the own-provincial scale (OPS) scenario, intra-province multifunctionality objectives are considered; the national and provincial scales (NPS) scenario considers multifunctionality within and beyond the province; while the desired land-use (DLU) scenario balances cross-scale multifunctionality while also optimizing for local functional suitability. Promoting multifunctionality as desirable, and evaluated based on minimizing functional land loss, the DLU scenario significantly outperforms the BAU scenario. The results indicate that the DLU scenario outperforms BAU, OPL, and NPS in optimizing urban and cropland layout, and preserving ecosystem integrity. It reduces high-quality arable land loss by 6.5% and minimizes the impact on ecological function areas by 12%, surpassing the BAU scenario. In contrast to the OPS and NPS scenarios, the DLU scenario exhibits a 6% and 2% increase in population and economic agglomeration within the Harbin-Daqing-Suihua (HDS) city cluster, a pivotal component of the national urbanization strategy. Furthermore, it enhances grain production capacity in the national grain-producing area, the Sanjiang Plain (SJP), with 9% and 12% boosts, respectively. Additionally, the DLU scenario expands the ecologically significant area, showing a 3.6% and 1% improvement in the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains (GLKM), nationally vital ecological service function areas. These advantages of the DLU scenario are expected to become more pronounced over time.

They provide diversified Recreational Ecosystem Services (RES), which are key components of the regional open space system. Traditional data and methods for evaluating RES in large parks have not fully considered the interactions between visitors and urban physical space environments. This study, grounded in the Theory of the Delivery Chain, defines parks over 100 ha as ""megaparks"", employs mobile phone signaling data to effectively distinguish between local and non-local visitors in megaparks in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region. An index system was constructed to evaluate the RES effect of megaparks by measuring mobile check-in density, service radius, and turnover volume using Hierarchical Linear Regression (HLR) to reveal the relevant spatial influence factors of 677 megaparks. This study revealed that there are remarkable geographic and population differences in the RES effects of megaparks across cities in the Yangtze River Delta region. The turnover volume indicator can play an important role in measuring the RES of megaparks. Ten factors, including Internet users' attention to parks, GDP per capita, Internet users' attention to city, green coverage rates of megaparks, density of bus stations within a 500 m-buffer, the network distance to the administrative center, observable mountain or terrain fluctuations, landscape shape index, cultural heritage within the park, and supporting facilities around the park, have positive or negative impacts on the RES effect of megaparks, but none of the influencing factors worked simultaneously on the three indicators of mobile check-in density, service radius, and turnover volume of megaparks. We found that the turnover volume indicator is more advantageous in reflecting the spatial characteristics of RES in megaparks in a large-scale region, and the measurements are closer to traditional perceptions, which can serve as an important complement to the indicators of visitor mobile check-in density and service radius.",Megaparks,Non -local visitors,Mobile phone signaling data,Turnover volume,"Lin, Liushan","Ding, Zhuoqun",ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,The Yangtze River Delta region,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In general, charging station operators (CSOs) in urban areas optimize pricing strategies to maximize their profits, while EV users aim to minimize traveling and charging costs by routing and choosing optimal CSs which can be formulated as a charging navigation problem. In this paper, a bi-level Nash-Stackelberg game framework is established to investigate the competitive pricing strategies for CSOs and the interactions between CSOs and the transportation system operator (TSO) which is introduced as a non-profit third-party to navigate EV users. Specifically, at the upper level of the framework, the pricing competition forms a Nash equilibrium with incomplete information due to privacy constraints. At the lower level, the TSO recommends the optimal CSs and related travel routes for EV users to reduce costs. The interactions between two levels, which are the charging load response to the price signals, are represented by a non-cooperative Stackelberg game.

We consider a transportation network companies (TNC) that employs a mixture of AVs and human drivers to provide ride-hailing services. The TNC platform determines the spatial prices, fleet size, human driver payments, and vehicle relocation strategies to maximize its profit, while individual passengers choose between different transport modes to minimize their travel costs. A market equilibrium model is proposed to capture the interactions among passengers, human drivers, AVs, and TNC over the transportation network. The overall problem is formulated as a nonconcave program, and an algorithm is developed to derive its approximate solution with a theoretical performance guarantee. Our study shows that TNC prioritizes AV deployment in higher-demand areas to make a higher profit. As AVs flood into these higher-demand areas, they compete with human drivers in the urban core and push them to relocate to suburbs. This leads to reduced earning opportunities for human drivers and increased spatial inequity for passengers. To mitigate these concerns, we consider: (a) a minimum wage for human drivers; and (b) a restrictive pickup policy that prohibits AVs from picking up passengers in higherdemand areas. In the former case, we show that a minimum wage for human drivers will protect them from the negative impact of AVs with negligible impacts on passengers. However, there exists a threshold beyond which the minimum wage will trigger the platform to replace the majority of human drivers with AVs. In the latter case, we show that prohibiting AVs from picking up passengers in higher-demand areas not only improves the spatial equity of ride-hailing services for passengers, but also substantially increases human driver surplus and restricts the increase of total fleet size compared to the unregulated case.

Due to varying scales and indistinct boundaries of buildings, it is crucial to fully leverage the high- and low-frequency features in building extraction from remote sensing images. However, previous studies have solely relied on either low- or high-frequency features, leading to errors such as omissions or internal holes in the detected buildings at various scales. Although some studies have considered the integration between both high- and low-frequency features, they overlook the suitability of different network depths for extracting different frequency features. A novel network called Cascaded Inception Conv-Former Network (CICF-Net) is proposed in this study to solve these problems. It leverages the parallel combination of convolutional neural network and Transformer to efficiently extract high- and low-frequency features for building extraction. In the encoder, as the network depth grows, we gradually reduce the contribution of high-frequency branch and enhance the focus on low-frequency branch. Moreover, a cascaded fusion strategy is employed to extract and integrate multiscale high- and low-frequency features. Meanwhile, we propose gated convolution UperNet as the decoder, which utilizes recursive gated convolution to facilitate multilevel spatial interactions and better restoration of fine-grained spatial details for building segmentation. The proposed CICF-Net achieves competitive accuracies on three public benchmarks: Massachusetts Building Dataset, WHU Aerial Building Dataset, and Inria Aerial Image Labeling Dataset, with IoU of 75.17%, 91.45%, and 81.28%, respectively.

Suburban areas are often more affordable in terms of housing, but these neighbourhoods tend to be car-oriented. This leads to higher commuter costs, immobility, transport and time poverty, pollution, higher accident rates and a lack of social interactions. To offer sustainable mobility options to citizens, we must comprehensively understand, together with their individual characteristics, their specific mobility practices and the built environment where they live.

Herein, we used data from the 2018 to 2021 annual travel survey conducted in the Barcelona region, together with land use and sociodemographic information. Our findings suggest that transport policies have encouraged sustainable mobility practices, particularly in the centre of Barcelona. Despite the positive results, considerable disparities exist between the inner and outer city, with a notable decline in sustainable mobility practices in the latter, due to the uneven distribution of basic services and uneven provision of public transport, together with lower density areas.

Such species show increased behavioural tolerance to humans, which plays an important role in human-wildlife coexistence. However, whether wildlife modulates tolerance differently between regions and cities is inadequately understood. Understanding how animals behaviourally modulate their tolerance to humans at the larger geographical scale can provide useful information to predict behavioural adaptations to urbanisation and adequate management actions for conservation. We examined alert distance (AD), flight initiation distance (FID), and vertical escape distance (VED) in Eurasian red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) in four countries (Finland, Germany, Japan, and the UK). Linear mixed models with Tukey's multicomparisons showed that all tolerance measures varied between countries. We subsequently analysed the relationship between site-scale environmental variables (vegetation conditions, presence of artificial feeding, and human population density) and tolerance behaviours separately by country. We found that squirrels were more tolerant in sites with taller trees and more underbrush cover in the UK, and more tolerant in sites with artificial feeding in Japan, while environmental variables were not associated with squirrels' tolerance in Finland and Germany. Our results indicated that regional forms of environmental factors and human-squirrel interactions play a key role in tolerance modification at the larger spatial scale.

Against this background, a burgeoning body of research literature has proposed quantitative methods for evaluating cities' progress towards the achievement of an x-minute city. However, current approaches predominately focus on the density and proximity aspects of x-minute cities, but underrepresent other critical aspects including the equality of x-minute cities. Human mobility patterns are also not accounted for in current approaches, leading to potential bias in evaluation results. This study bridges these research gaps by proposing an equality assessment framework that explicitly accounts for disparities in mobility patterns of different population groups. A mobility-aware accessibility metric is first proposed and then used as the basis for assessing the (in)equality of urban service provision across space and population groups. We use a full month of mobile phone signaling data in the city of Nanjing, China to obtain the activity patterns of different population groups. The case study suggests that not accounting for human mobility would lead to an overestimation of accessibility and accordingly a possibly too rosy view of achieving the x-minute city goal. In addition, the measurement of x-minute cities is sensitive to location, time, service types and population groups. These results have implications that developing an equitable x-minute city should move beyond the overly simplified proximity-based metric, but further accounts for different population groups' varying mobility patterns and their interactions with urban services.",X -minute city,Accessibility,Equality,Human mobility patterns,"Tong, Ziyu",,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The issue is particularly severe in Southeast Asia, where natural habitats have been continuously modified due to rapid agricultural and urban expansion, consequently forcing many wildlife species to adapt to human-dominated landscapes. This disruption also impacts co-occurring, competing species, affecting both dominant and subordinate species, which can be disruptive to ecosystems. For this reason, understanding how environmental and human factors influence wildlife in human-dominated landscapes is necessary for long-term wildlife conservation in these areas. This study examined the effects of extrinsic factors on interspecific competition between the Asian small-clawed otter (Aonyx cinereus) and the smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata) using two-species occupancy models with a continuous-time detection process that can simultaneously account for space and time. Our results supported models suggesting spatial and temporal dependence between these two species in southern Thailand. We found that occupancy was explained by the availability of natural habitat and aquaculture, while co-occurrence between species was better explained by the size of contiguous agricultural patches and the number of urban patches in the landscape. Human disturbance had limited influence on otter occupancy but rather impacted their detection at different scales, depending on the intensity of human disturbance. Otters occupying the most human-disturbed areas responded to humans at the smallest temporal scale, perhaps indicating a degree of habituation to humans when encounters are non-threatening and adequate habitat remain (i.e., high habitat heterogeneity and undisturbed corridors). However, increased overlap between otters and humans might lead to more conflict, and private property regulation is likely challenging for otter conservation.The shrinkage of natural habitats escalates competition between wildlife species. This interspecific competition is a crucial factor that influences behavioral adaptation and geographic distribution for both dominant and subordinate species, especially urban wildlife occupying anthropogenic landscapes that have been persistently changing. Using continuous-time detections from camera traps along the coast of southern Thailand, we investigated the relationship between the Asian small-clawed otter and smooth-coated otter, and their responses to humans through time and space simultaneously. We found temporal avoidance and spatial dependence between the two species of otters; however, their relationship varied with human density levels. Our findings suggest that these distinct otter species can co-exist and adapt to human-dominated landscapes under specific conditions, for example when human encounters are non-threatening, habitat heterogeneity is sufficient, and habitat corridors remain undisturbed.",Continuous-time detection,Interspecific interactions,Two-species occupancy models,Small carnivores,"Ngoprasert, Dusit",,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,Urbanization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study uses observation data from iNaturalist, an online social network of voluntary users sharing biodiversity information, which was collected from 20,434 parks in the United States. It explores the relationship between park characteristics and the mean travel distance of users to parks. The latter is based on the average of distances between an iNaturalist user's typical main area of iNaturalist contributions and the locations of the user's observations falling inside a park of interest. The DBSCAN clustering algorithm is used to determine each user's main contribution area. An Eigenvector Spatial Filtering (ESF) model shows that the log of the average distance travelled to parks is positively associated with certain park management types (e.g. National Parks, State Parks) and biodiversity, but negatively associated with the population around a park. The results provide insights into the nature of iNaturalist user visitation patterns to parks which can be used for targeted outreach campaigns and a more user-centric approach to promote park attractions and biodiversity conservation.",Crowdsourcing,travel distance,park,iNaturalist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it has become a challenging problem due to spatial-temporal demand fluctuations and heterogeneous passengers' travel behavior, i.e., the interaction between the departure and arrival passengers. In this paper, we develop an explainable Stacking-Catboost model for passenger flow prediction combining the passenger's return probability computation. The model explores several basic ensemble learning models and the best stacking strategy. To better characterize the macroscopic spatiotemporal travel patterns other than the micro individual travel behavior, several relevant variables such as train operation characteristics, the nearby bus stations, and points of interest are considered. Ablation studies are conducted to investigate the utility of each component of the proposed model. An explainable analysis is performed to interpret information from ""black box"" models and quantify the contribution of each feature. We present a real-world case study conducted in the Beijing metro, demonstrating that our proposed method achieves significant improvements over existing techniques in hourly prediction tasks. Specifically, our approach outperforms the CategoricalBoosting (CatBoost) by up to 11.11 % and the Random Forest (RF) by up to 12.90 %, showcasing the effectiveness of incorporating macroscopic spatiotemporal travel patterns and micro individual travel behavior to enhance short-term forecasting accuracy. The global interpretability of models reveals key factors that impact performance, such as returning passenger flow, historical travel demand, and timetable data.

Data-driven models are utilized to forecast waterlogging areas by establishing intricate relationships between explanatory variables and waterlogging states. This approach tackles the constraints of mechanistic models, which are frequently complex and unable to incorporate socio-economic factors. Previous research predominantly employed single-type data-driven models to predict waterlogging locations and evaluation of their effectiveness. There is a scarcity of comprehensive performance comparisons and uncertainty analyses of different types of models, as well as a lack of interpretability analysis. The chosen study area was the central area of Beijing, which is prone to waterlogging. Given the high manpower, time, and economic costs associated with collecting waterlogging information, the waterlogging point distribution map released by the Beijing Water Affairs Bureau was selected as labeled samples. Twelve factors affecting waterlogging susceptibility were chosen as explanatory variables to construct Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function (SVM-RBF), Particle Swarm Optimization-Weakly Labeled Support Vector Machine (PSO-WELLSVM), and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt). The utilization of diverse single evaluation indicators (such as F-score, Kappa, AUC, etc.) to assess the model performance may yield conflicting results. The Distance between Indices of Simulation and Observation (DISO) was chosen as a comprehensive measure to assess the model's performance in predicting waterlogging points. PSO-WELLSVM exhibited the highest performance with a DISOtest value of 0.63, outperforming MaxEnt (0.78), which excelled in identifying areas highly susceptible to waterlogging, including extremely high susceptibility zones. The SVM-RBF and RF models demonstrated suboptimal performance and exhibited overfitting. The examination of waterlogging susceptibility distribution maps predicted by the four models revealed significant spatial differences due to variations in computational principles and input parameter complexities. The integration of four WSAMs based on logistic regression has been shown to significantly decrease the uncertainty of a single data-driven model and identify the most flood-prone areas. To improve the interpretability of the data model, a geographical detector was incorporated to demonstrate the explanatory capacity of 12 variables and the process of waterlogging. Building Density (BD) exhibits the highest explanatory power in relation to explain waterlogging susceptibility (Q value = 0.202), followed by Distance to Road, Frequency of Heavy Rainstorms (FHR), DEM, etc. The interaction between BD and FHR results in a nonlinear increase in the explanatory power of waterlogging susceptibility. The presence of waterlogging susceptibility risk in the research area can be attributed to the interactions of multiple factors.",Urban waterlogging susceptibility,Machine learning,MaxEnt,DISO,"Sun, Tong",,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,Uncertainty analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Environmental parameters, particularly total phosphorus (TP) and dissolved oxygen (DO), were found to significantly influence the distribution and composition of bacterial phyla through redundancy analysis. The pattern of bacterial community assembly has shifted from predominantly deterministic to predominantly stochastic as a result of human activities. The analysis of DOM through EEM-PARAFAC identified three main fluorescent components, reflecting varied sources and interactions with bacterial communities. Upstream, microbial activities predominantly contributed to autochthonous DOM, while downstream, increased inputs of allochthonous DOM from human activities were evident. Furthermore, the study revealed that through the introduction of various organic pollutants and nutrient loads that shift microbial metabolic functions towards increased degradation and transformation of complex organic compounds downstream. Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that upstream human activities primarily affected bacterial communities indirectly by altering DOM properties. In contrast, downstream activities had both direct and indirect effects due to higher pollutant loads and more complex environmental conditions.

The aim of the present study was to explore the ecological dynamics of necrophagous Sarcophagidae and Calliphoridae flies along an anthropization gradient. This research investigated alpha and beta diversity patterns to unravel the impact of human-induced environmental changes on these insect communities and also assesses the dynamics of functional groups in relation to their impact on medical and forensic fields. Five distinct habitats, ranging from urban to forested areas, were surveyed in two Departments in the Province of Chaco, Argentina. Necrophagous flies were collected using van Someren-Rydon canopy traps across three seasons. Two main functional groups were analyzed: oviparous flies (Calliphoridae) and larviparous flies (Sarcophagidae). Results indicated a significant negative correlation between Sarcophagidae species richness and anthropization, whereas Calliphoridae showed increased abundance in highly anthropized sites. The combined assemblage of Calliphoridae+Sarcophagidae exhibited significant relationships across all community parameters evaluated. Beta diversity analysis revealed turnover as the main process shaping dipteran communities along the anthropization gradient, with spatial species replacement dominating. This underscores the importance of interspecific spatial segregation in dipteran community composition. In conclusion, this study enhances our understanding of the ecological adaptations of necrophagous dipterans to anthropogenic disturbances. The observed shifts in diversity and abundance have implications for forensic investigations and public health, emphasizing the need for nuanced monitoring and conservation strategies.

This assessment was used to evaluate the safety of trees in a study area at Thammasat University Rangsit Center, Thailand. In two priority-selected areas for tree risk management, 3659 trees representing 139 species were assessed, and to understand the spatial patterns of tree health conditions and risks, the study employed a GIS-based mapping methodology to manage tree inventory and analyze the spatial patterns of tree health conditions and risks. A decision tree protocol based on the chi-squared automatic interaction detector (CHAID) algorithm, which employs machine learning, was used to evaluate the risk of tree failure. Our study successfully identified seven variables that are crucial in assessing the risk of tree failure. According to the findings, the overall accuracy rate of failure risk classification was 87.35 %, and of all the trees evaluated, 280 trees (7.65 % of the total) representing 34 different species were at high risk.

However, traditional landscape ecological risk (LER) assessments consider the potential loss of ES supply while ignoring the supply-demand coupling relationship, and fails to reveal the actual situation of ecological risk. To fill this gap, taking the Southwest China (SWC) as an example, this study proposed an improved LER assessment method that focuses on ES supply-demand balance, and analyzed the spatio-temporal characteristics of LER and its driving factors in the SWC from 2000 to 2020 by using hotspot analysis, geo-detectors and geographical temporally weighted regression models. The results show that (1) the comparison results with the traditional LER evaluation method demonstrated the improved method's superior rationality and reliability. The overall LER of the SWC over the past 20 years displayed a fluctuating trend, with a spatial clustering pattern of high in the northeast and low in the southwest. (2) Human activities explained the relatively high spatial heterogeneity in high-risk areas, while in low-risk areas it was mainly the interaction of natural factors and landscape structural. Meanwhile, obvious temporal non-stationary was identified in the evolution of the key factors. The positive effects of land use intensity and landscape fragmentation gradually weakened, while the negative effects of Shannon diversity index gradually increased.

AM4VR has a horizontal resolution of 13 km over the US, allowing it to resolve urban-to-rural chemical regimes, mesoscale convective systems, and land-surface heterogeneity. With the resolution gradually reducing to 100 km over the Indian Ocean, we achieve multi-decadal simulations driven by observed sea surface temperatures at 50% of the computational cost for a 25-km uniform-resolution grid. In contrast with GFDL's AM4.1 contributing to the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project at 100 km resolution, AM4VR features much improved US climate mean patterns and variability. In particular, AM4VR shows improved representation of: precipitation seasonal-to-diurnal cycles and extremes, notably reducing the central US dry-and-warm bias; western US snowpack and summer drought, with implications for wildfires; and the North American monsoon, affecting dust storms. AM4VR exhibits excellent representation of winter precipitation, summer drought, and air pollution meteorology in California with complex terrain, enabling skillful prediction of both extreme summer ozone pollution and winter haze events in the Central Valley. AM4VR also provides vast improvements in the process-level representations of biogenic volatile organic compound emissions, interactive dust emissions from land, and removal of air pollutants by terrestrial ecosystems. We highlight the value of increased model resolution in representing climate-air quality interactions through land-biosphere feedbacks. AM4VR offers a novel opportunity to study global dimensions to US air quality, especially the role of Earth system feedbacks in a changing climate.NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory has developed a new variable-resolution global chemistry-climate model for research at the nexus of US climate and air quality extremes. In contrast with the global models contributing to the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Report, this model features more than 10 times finer spatial resolution over the contiguous US, allowing it to better resolve cities, mountain valleys, thunderstorms, and urban-to-rural air quality variations. This model features much improved representation of regional rainfall extremes, drought, and severe air pollution events in diverse US air basins, including California. Notably, this model reduces the central US dry-and-warm bias that has persisted in many generations of climate models. As global climate change leads to more hot and dry weather, the resulting droughts are creating dust-prone bare lands or stressing plants, making them less able to remove ozone pollution from the air. These effects are included in this model, with particular focus on integrating physical, chemical, and biological components at high spatial resolution to understand Earth system feedbacks to US air quality extremes in a changing climate.A new variable-resolution global chemistry-climate model has been developed for research at the nexus of US climate and air quality extremes This model unifies component advances in physics, chemistry and land-atmosphere interactions within a seamless variable-resolution framework This model features much improved US regional precipitation, drought, and air quality extremes compared to previous models",drought,Earth system feedbacks,extremes,air quality-climate interactions,"Ginoux, Paul","Dunne, John",JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS,precipitation,high-resolution,,,,,,,"Malyshev, Sergey","Shevliakova, Elena",,,"Ahsan, Hamza","Garner, Steve","Paulot, Fabien","Pouyaei, Arman","Smith, Steven J.","Xie, Yuanyu","Zadeh, Niki","Zhou, Linjiong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are widely used to understand how small-scale processes scale up to affect ecological dynamics at larger spatial scales, and have been applied to a wide diversity of theoretical and applied problems in all systems, such as arid ecosystems, coral reefs, forests, bacteria, or urban growth. Despite their wide applications, SCA implementations are often ad-hoc, lacking performance, guarantees of correctness and poorly reproducible. De novo implementation of SCA for each specific system and application also represents a major barrier for many practitioners. To provide a unifying, well-tested technical basis to this class of models and facilitate their implementation, we built chouca, an R package that translates definitions of SCA models into compiled code, and runs simulations in an efficient way. chouca supports SCA based on rectangular grids where transition probabilities are defined for each cell, with performance typically two to three orders of magnitude above typical implementations in interpreted languages (e.g. R, Python), all while maintaining an intuitive interface in the R environment. Exact and mean-field simulations can be run, and both numerical and graphical results can be easily exported. Besides providing better reproducibility and accessibility, a fast engine for SCA unlocks novel, computationally intensive statistical approaches, such as simulation-based inference of ecological interactions from field data, which represents by itself an important avenue for research.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to balance the dual goals of synergistic development of ecosystem services (ESs) and increased urbanization. Previous studies have analyzed the impacts of urbanization on ESs but have selected a limited number of indicators and have not focused on the impacts of urbanization on ES pair interactions. In this study, six key ESs (water yield, habitat quality, soil conservation, carbon storage, carbon sequestration and oxygen production, and food production) and total ecosystem services (TESs) were selected, and trends in the temporal and spatial relationship between trade-offs and synergies were analyzed over 20 years. This study refined the living standards urbanization indicator and evaluated the impact of urbanization and multiple drivers on ESs and ES pair interrelationships based on geo-detectors and segmented linear regression. The results show that there is heterogeneity in the overall and regional ES trade-offs and synergistic relationships, and water yield (WY)-related ES pairs generally exhibit synergistic relationships at the overall level. Spatially, however, the trade-off ratio exceeds the synergy ratio. Segmented linear regression results show that the relationship between all the urbanization indicators and TESs demonstrates an upward trend followed by a downward trend. Measures such as the increase in man-made oases in the early stages of urbanization did have some positive effects on TESs. However, as urbanization increased, these positive effects were quickly offset by the negative effects of overdevelopment and environmental degradation, leading to an overall decline in TESs. Urbanization of construction land (CL) had the most direct impact on ecosystem services. In summary, due to special climatic constraints, arid zones are more sensitive than other ecosystems, and urban development is strictly limited by oasis capacity. As cities expand, attention needs to be focused on protecting ecological land and limiting the expansion of CL to promote the synergistic development of urbanization and ecosystem services in arid zones.",ecosystem services (ES),trade-offs,comprehensive urbanization level (CUL),arid zones,"Zhou, Xiaozhen","Zhang, Qing",REMOTE SENSING,multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spatial analysis of these rich details has the potential to help build a bottom-up picture of interaction between dissidents and inquisitors that moves beyond institutional perspectives. This task is rendered challenging due to the inconsistencies and uncertainties of what inquisitors and their notaries typically recorded about the spatial associations of suspects. Probably the most common indicator of such associations found in inquisition records are toponymic surnames. They present challenges of coverage (not everybody had a toponymic surname) and interpretation (multiple possible meanings). This study attempts to tackle the challenge of interpreting such surnames within the context of the nine sentencing events held by the inquisitor Peter Seila in 1241 and 1242 in the Quercy region of Languedoc: covering 650 sentenced individuals, the register documenting these events is the earliest extant record of an inquisition of such scale. Rather than taking the interpretative challenges of toponymic surnames as reasons to limit ourselves to qualitative analysis, our approach shows the value of rendering and analysing them as structured data. Firstly, we quantify the context of toponymic surnames, placing them against the background of broader name construction practices and other social factors. Secondly, we plot and analyse the geocoded data derived from toponymic surnames with the benefit of this contextualisation, looking especially at the distance of toponyms from their associated sentencing centres, in order to derive narratives that best explain the generality of their meaning. The results allow us to appraise the actual spatial coverage of the nine sentencing events. The first two, centred on the important towns of Montauban and Moissac, seem most likely to have been primarily urban affairs, with little evidence of rural coverage. The remainder, which took place in castra (fortified villages), appear to have covered more of the surrounding countryside.

Coordinating the relationship between socio-economic (SE) and ecological environment (EE) in this area is instructive for economic development and ecological improvement of ethnic minority regions in Southwest China. Previous studies on the degree of coupled coordination in alpine wetlands are relatively scarce. In this study, six counties under the jurisdiction of the Zogie wetland in China are selected as the research objects, and a new framework for coupled coordination analysis is constructed, and the particle swarm optimization-dynamic deviation maximisation (PSO-DDM) method is used to assess the indicators' performance of the SE and EE subsystems. The coupled coordination degree (CCD) model was then used to assess the temporal and spatial change patterns of coupled coordination between SE and EE in the Zogie Wetland, thus revealing the interaction mechanism between the SE and EE of alpine wetlands. The results of the study show that the overall change in CCD of SE and EE has shown an increasing trend over time, but it has not reached excellent co-ordination at the moment, which may be due to the slow development of the area as a result of its special geographical location and relatively weak ecological resource endowment. In addition, industrial restructuring, increase in vegetation cover and investment in industrial pollution control have a contributing effect on CCD, while industrial emissions and urban sewage discharge have a significant inhibitory effect on CCD.

However, the early models, developed using linear regressions and data from fixed monitoring stations and passive sampling, were primarily designed to model traditional and criteria air pollutants and had limitations in capturing high-resolution spatiotemporal variations of air pollution. Over the past decade, there has been a notable development of multi-source observations from low-cost monitors, mobile monitoring, and satellites, in conjunction with the integration of advanced statistical methods and spatially and temporally dynamic predictors, which have facilitated significant expansion and advancement of LUR approaches. This paper reviews and synthesizes the recent advances in LUR approaches from the perspectives of the changes in air quality data acquisition, novel predictor variables, advances in modeldeveloping approaches, improvements in validation methods, model transferability, and modeling software as reported in 155 LUR studies published between 2011 and 2023. We demonstrate that these developments have enabled LUR models to be developed for larger study areas and encompass a wider range of criteria and unregulated air pollutants. LUR models in the conventional spatial structure have been complemented by more complex spatiotemporal structures.

To address this need, a systematic literature review on the building information modelling methodology was conducted, employing a structured protocol and specific tools for the analysis of academic studies, based on PRISMA guidelines and StArt software (version 3.4 BETA). Ninety relevant studies published between 1998 and 2024, were analysed and selected from the Web of Science, Scopus, and Engineering Village databases. Findings indicate that China leads in publications with 34%, followed by Brazil (8%) and the United Kingdom (7%). The analysis emphasises the use of drones and LiDAR scanners for precise spatial data, processed by 3D reconstruction tools like Pix4D and FARO As-Built. Revit excels in 3D modelling, providing a robust platform for visualisation and analysis. Visual programming tools such as Dynamo automate processes and optimise material reuse. The study presents a conceptual framework that integrates these technologies with the principles of the circular economy, clarifying the interactions and practical applications that promote the sustainable management of demolition waste from urban buildings and process efficiency. Although the approach promotes material reuse and sustainability, it still faces barriers such as the need for waste segregation at the source, the adaptation of innovative technologies, like the iPhone 15 Pro LiDAR and thermal cameras, as well as associated costs.

Method: In this case, urban crash data from the 10 largest Italian cities were used to develop four logistic regression models having the driver-related crash circumstance (aberrant behaviors: inattentive driving, illegal maneuvering, wrong interaction with pedestrian and speeding) as dependent variables and the other crash-related factors as predictors (information about the users and the vehicles involved and about road geometry and conditions). Two other models were built to study the influence of the same factors on the injury severity of the occupants of vehicles for which crash circumstances related to driver aberrant behaviors were observed and of the involved pedestrians. The variability between the 10 different cities was considered through a multilevel approach, which revealed a significant variability only for the inattention-related crash circumstance.

Socio-economic development is facing increasingly serious regional problems such as land degradation, environmental pollution, and biodiversity loss. In essence, it is the result of the intensified impact of human activities on the earth system, resulting in the coupling disorder and functional imbalance of HES. Therefore, the spatial identification, type diagnosis, and intensity evaluation of HES are critical topics in modern HES science and comprehensive geography. These themes form the foundation for scientifically cognizing the evolution process and mechanisms of HES, as well as for supporting decision-making aimed at HES coordination and sustainable development.Based on the theory of human-earth relationship areal system and the geographic methodology of ""main function-oriented zoning, dominant type classification, and principal purpose grading"", this study constructed a top-down scientific cognition and method system for modern HES identification-diagnosis-evaluation. The study integrated multi-source spatial data of land use, population density, nighttime light index, and point of interest, adopted multiple quantitative methods of decision tree, spatial clustering, and human footprint intensity index, and conducted the geospatial identification, dominant type diagnosis, activity intensity evaluation of the HES in China from 2000 to 2020.The results indicated that: (1) The area proportion of China's HES has increased from 53.9% to 54.1%, stabilizing at around 54%. Spatially, it was characterized by a differentiation feature of high-values in the southeast and low-values in the northwest. The HES proportion in plain areas, cultivated land, and concentrated urban areas was significantly higher than that in mountainous and sparsely populated areas. The proportion of living functional zone in the HES increased from 3.61% to 5.24%, and the proportions of production and ecological functional zones decreased from 35.19% and 61.20% to 34.66% and 60.10%, respectively. (2) Rapid urbanization and rural revitalization have resulted in an increase in the area of urban HES and rural HES by 135.45% and 9.59%, respectively. However, these increases were mostly from agricultural HES. The agricultural HES and ecological HES have been affected by the Grain for Green Project and cultivated land expansion, resulting in mutual transformation between the two types and the decrease of 1.06% and 1.37%. (3) The human footprint intensity of China's HES has increased from 9.28 to 10.25, with an increase of 10%. This increase was characterized by the expansion of high-value areas and the reduction of low-value areas, indicating the growing and spatial clustering of human activities.The findings of this study have provided hierarchical answers to key questions such as where are the distributions, what are the types, and what are the grades for HES.

However, under the combined action of train dynamic loads and complex environmental factors, problems, such as the fracture of steel spring vibration isolators and suspension vibrations induced by the uneven settlement of the base, often occur. The failure of isolator support stiffness is often hidden in its early stages and is challenging to identify by conventional detection methods. At the same time, it will aggravate the wheel-rail interaction, accelerate the deterioration of track structure, and even affect the driving safety. This study first establishes a detailed coupled train-floating slab track-foundation analytical model. Then the influence of the vibration isolator support stiffness failure on the dynamic indices of the floating slab track system response is analyzed. A set of defect identification methods that can detect the number of failed steel springs, severity of damage, and their location is proposed. Finally, an intelligent monitoring system for support stiffness of floating slab track is built by combining the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm and statistical data analysis and is applied to a rail line in southern China. During a three-year monitoring campaign, a suspension failure and a fracture of a steel spring were each successfully detected and detailed failure information was obtained. Field investigation results were consistent with the damage identification results. After repair, the track structure dynamic response returned to the average pre-damage level and further deterioration had been arrested.

This is due to the complex interaction of flow pathways and the need to assess cost-benefit trade-offs for various BGI options. This study aims to find a cost-effective BGI placement scheme by developing an improved approach called the Cost OptimisatioN Framework for Implementing blue-Green infrastructURE (CONFIGURE). The optimisation framework integrates a detailed hydrodynamic flood simulation model with a multi-objective optimisation algorithm (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II). The use of a high-resolution flood simulation model ensures the explicit representation of BGI and other land use features to simulate flow pathways and surface flood risk accurately, while the optimisation algorithm guarantees achieving the best costbenefit trade-offs for given BGI options. The current study uses the advanced CityCAT hydrodynamic flood model to evaluate the efficiency of the optimisation framework and the impact of location and size of permeable interventions on the optimisation process and subsequent cost-benefit trade-offs. This is achieved by dividing permeable surface areas into intervention zones of varying size and quantity. Furthermore, rainstorm events with 100-year and 30-year return periods are analysed to identify any common optimal solutions for different rainfall intensities. Depending on the number of intervention locations, the automated framework reliably achieves optimal BGI implementation solutions in a fraction of the time required to find the best solutions by trialling all possible options. Designing and optimising interventions with smaller sizes but many permeable zones save a good fraction of investment. However, such a design scheme requires more computational time to find optimal options. Furthermore, the optimal spatial configuration of BGI varies with different rainstorm severities, suggesting a need for careful selection of the rainstorm return period.

This challenge includes both inter-class occlusion caused by environmental objects obscuring pedestrians, and intra-class occlusion resulting from interactions between pedestrians. In complex and variable urban settings, these compounded occlusion patterns critically limit the efficacy of both one-stage and two-stage pedestrian detectors, leading to suboptimal detection performance. To address this, we introduce a novel architecture termed the Attention-Guided Feature Enhancement Network (AGFEN), designed within the deep convolutional neural network framework. AGFEN improves the semantic information of high-level features by mapping it onto low-level feature details through sampling, creating an effect comparable to mask modulation. This technique enhances both channel-level and spatial-level features concurrently without incurring additional annotation costs. Furthermore, we transition from a traditional one-to-one correspondence between proposals and predictions to a one-to-multiple paradigm, facilitating non-maximum suppression using the prediction set as the fundamental unit. Additionally, we integrate these methodologies by aggregating local features between regions of interest (RoI) through the reuse of classification weights, effectively mitigating false positives. Our experimental evaluations on three widely used datasets demonstrate that AGFEN achieves a 2.38% improvement over the baseline detector on the CrowdHuman dataset, underscoring its effectiveness and potential for advancing pedestrian detection technologies.",pedestrian detection,computer vision,attention-guided feature enhancement,convolutional neural network,"Shi, Jinglin",,SENSORS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Taking a sponge campus in Xi'an as the research object, this paper proposes a method to realize the interaction between surface water and groundwater at different spatial and temporal scales, so as to construct a SWMM-MODFLOW coupled numerical model to carry out the analysis of hydrological effect of sponge city comprehensively taking into account both surface water and groundwater. Simultaneously, the SWMM is coupled with the NSGA-III algorithm for multi-objective optimization of LID facility configurations, aiming to identify a globally optimal solution set for LID facility configurations under both long and short-duration rainfall scenarios. A novel framework for a comprehensive evaluation system of surface water-groundwater benefits is also developed to comprehensively assess LID facility optimization schemes that meet the goals of stormwater runoff infiltration and reduction, pollution interception and purification, and groundwater recharge conservation. The simulation results show that after optimization, the LID scheme has good surface runoff regulation effects and pollution reduction capabilities, reducing the runoff peak from 2.297 m3/s 3 /s to 2.128 m3/s, 3 /s, significantly lowering the risk of inundation and effectively reducing the total suspended solids (SS) load by 42.38 kg at the outfall.

This study reviews previous research on the LMDI method in the context of building carbon emissions, offering a comprehensive overview of its application. It summarizes the technical foundations, applications, and evaluations of the LMDI method and analyzes the major research trends and common calculation methods used in the past 25 years in the LMDI-related field. Moreover, it reviews the use of the LMDI in the building sector, urban energy, and carbon emissions and discusses other methods, such as the Generalized Divisia Index Method (GDIM), Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), and Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) techniques. This study explores and compares the advantages and disadvantages of these methods and their use in the building sector to the LMDI.

Together with the estimation of kernel density and spatial correlation analysis, the enhanced LMDI method overcomes these drawbacks by offering a more comprehensive review of the drivers of energy usage and carbon emissions. Integrating machine learning and big data technologies can enhance data-processing capabilities and analytical accuracy, offering scientific policy recommendations and practical tools for low-carbon city development. Through particular case studies, this paper indicates the effectiveness of these approaches and proposes measures that include optimizing building design, enhancing energy efficiency, and refining energy-management procedures.

To formulate appropriate environmental policies, it is vital to gain a comprehensive understanding of the characteristics and influential factors driving the ESs' transformation in the YRB. The spatiotemporal dynamics in ESs was evaluated using the InVEST model, and the modes of the ESs' transformation were summarized. The elements impacting ESs' transformation and their interactions were assessed using the optimal parameter-based geographical detector (OPGD). Over the period from 1980 to 2020, the water yield within the YRB exhibited an upward trajectory, with a distinctive spatial pattern characterized by higher values in the southern and eastern regions, in contrast to lower values observed in the northern and western regions. Similarly, soil conservation demonstrated a tendency to rise over the duration of the research, with southern and western regions consistently exhibiting higher values compared to the northern and eastern regions. In contrast, habitat quality decreased over time and was accompanied by a progressive spatial decline from the southeast regions to the northwest regions. The ESs' transformation in the YRB from 1980 to 2020 indicated three modes: (1) simultaneous increases, this mode was characterized by concurrent increases in water yield and soil conservation; (2) increase and decrease, in this mode, there was an increase in soil conservation accompanied by a decrease in habitat quality; and (3) increase and deterioration, the third mode entailed an increase in water yield but a simultaneous deterioration in habitat quality. The 45-km grid was the best spatial scale for the analysis in this study. Over the span of 2000 through 2020, the ESs' transformation in the YRB was subject to the influence of natural environmental, geographic location-related, socioeconomic, and policy factors. The determinants of the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in ESs' transformation in the YRB demonstrated double-factor and nonlinear enhancement effects. The counterchange with the most significant effects on ESs' transformation were those between economic density and annual mean precipitation, annual mean temperature and ecological restoration, and the per capita income of urban residents and vegetation index.",Ecosystem services (ESs),Spatiotemporal differentiation,Transformation mode,Driving factors,"Wang, Kun",,ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,Yellow River basin (YRB),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Researchers are actively investigating the safety implications associated with scooters, given their relatively new status as transportation options. However, analyzing scooter safety presents a unique challenge due to the complexity of determining safe riding environments. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of scooter crash risk within various buffer zones, utilizing the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning algorithm. The core objective was to unravel the multifaceted factors influencing scooter crashes and assess the predictive model's performance across different buffers or spatial proximity to crash sites. After evaluating the model's accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity across buffer distances ranging from 5 ft to 250 ft with the scooter crash as a reference point, a discernible trend emerged: as the buffer distance decreases, the model's sensitivity increases, although at the expense of accuracy and specificity, which exhibit a gradual decline. Notably, at the widest buffer of 250 ft, the model achieved a high accuracy of 97% and specificity of 99%, but with a lower sensitivity of 31%. Contrastingly, at the closest buffer of 5 ft, sensitivity peaked at 95%, albeit with slightly reduced accuracy and specificity. Feature importance analysis highlighted the most significant predictor across all buffer distances, emphasizing the impact of vehicle interactions on scooter crash likelihood. Explainable Artificial Intelligence through SHAP value analysis provided deeper insights into each feature's contribution to the predictive model, revealing passenger vehicle types of significantly escalated crash risks. Intriguingly, specific vehicular maneuvers, notably stopping in traffic lanes, alongside the absence of Traffic Control Devices (TCDs), were identified as the major contributors to increased crash occurrences. Road conditions, particularly wet and dry, also emerged as substantial risk factors. Furthermore, the study highlights the significance of road design, where elements like junction types and horizontal alignments - specifically 4 and 5-legged intersections and curves - are closely associated with heightened crash risks. These findings articulate a complex and spatially detailed framework of factors impacting scooter crashes, offering vital insights for urban planning and policymaking.",Scooter crashes,Spatial analysis,Explainable AI,SHAP values,"Kinero, Abdallah","Tamakloe, Reuben",,Feature importance,XGBoost,,,,,,,"Kasomi, Sarah",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spatial distribution analysis reveals high soil gas concentrations along the fault zone, prompting the establishment of measurement lines along specific fault segments, such as Niudong fault, with a vertical burial trend. The measured average Rn flux ranges from 71.44 to 335.35 mBq m(-2)s(-1), while CO2 flux ranges from 25.96 to 78.23 g m(-2)d(-1). Furthermore, the average Rn and CO2 concentration intensities range from 0.91 to 2.30 and 1.13 to 2.61, respectively, indicating significant degassing in the fault zone.Geothermal well samples are collected from the deep reservoir in XNA, displaying a predominance of Cl-Na composition. Analysis of the Na-K-Mg equilibrium diagram suggests that the chemical characteristics of deep geothermal water are a result of interactions with rocks and mixing with shallow cold water in XNA. Isotopic analysis indicates the atmospheric precipitation origin of the deep geothermal water with extensive lateral recharge from underground runoff, emphasizing strong water-rock interactions. Comparison with other tectonic units in the region reveals that the Niudong Fault Zone serves as a regional geothermal control structure, facilitating deep fluid convection.In the eastern part of XNA, the geochemical analysis reveals concentrated degassing and a relatively high proportion of mantle-derived sources near the Niudong Fault Zone. This observation suggests the fault zone serves as a primary conduit for deep gases and geothermal fluids. The findings of this research provide valuable scientific references for future urban planning, energy utilization, and geologic hazard monitoring in XNA.

This paper systematically reviews the scale issues in runoff and sediment delivery (SIRSD) as a research field by integrating the traditional review approach and bibliometric analysis. This review summarises SIRSD's roots and the scale effect on runoff and sediment delivery. Then, we provide quantitative insights into the SIRSD domain's development history, thematic structure, geographic distribution, international cooperation, and methodologies. Findings show that: i) SIRSD arises from the gap between the nonlinearity of runoff and sediment delivery across scales and our ability to measure it. Point-based and short-term measurements cannot capture the non-linearities from the spatio-temporal heterogeneities and cross-scale interactions of factors or processes. ii) Previous literature provides evidence that the spatial scaling of specific runoff (r), soil erosion (SE), sediment yield (SSY), or sediment delivery ratio (SDR) with drainage area (A) or slope length (L) exhibits contrasting patterns due to distinct mechanisms. Infiltration-excess and saturationexcess processes account for inverse and positive r-A relations, respectively. Interrill-erosion and rill-erosion cause inverse and positive SE-L relations. Hillslope-erosion and channel/bank-erosion explain inverse and positive SSY-A relations. Downstream increasing deposition and additional sediment inputs drive inverse and positive SDR-A relations. These scaling relationships can be nonlinear or complex due to spatial heterogeneities in land use, vegetation, topography, climate, lithology, and soil characteristics. Hence, applying an empirical scaling equation developed from the region with distinct environmental contexts is not recommended. Furthermore, the existing scaling patterns or equations may require updating given global climate and land use change. iii) SIRSD is a complex and multidisciplinary issue investigated by scientists from 93 countries since 1928. International research has substantially facilitated the understanding of SIRSD; still, more collaboration should focus on less-developed countries with high soil and water loss risks and urgent conservation needs, such as those in Africa and South America under cropland expansion. iv) Scale mismatch and scale break have discredited large-scale erosion and sediment assessments. Incorporating gully and bank erosion into modelling, extending the scale range of the L factor, and expanding the sediment scaling scope from watershed to slope may make a difference. Therefore, more research with nested design incorporating multiple scales is necessary for cross-scale analysis and scalable modelling. Addressing global climate change requires improving real-time urban flood forecasting and integrating downscaled climate models with hydrology, erosion, and sediment transport models.",Scale effects,Runoff and soil erosion,Sediment delivery ratio (SDR),Systematic review,,,EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS,Bibliometric analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The UX+XR method had four phases. Each phase incorporated a cross-strategy UX+XR during the design process stages. Using UX+XR, the participants designed an architectural installation where the concepts of transformability, ephemerality, interactivity, flexibility, adaptability, versatility, and playfulness were present. Based on testing the six architectural installations designed during the studio using the UX+XR method, our data showed that XR enhanced the designer's perception, constituted a new means of expression on an accurate scale, and is a highly immersive and interactive resource for communicating ideas and reinforcing visualization, simulation, stimulation, and interaction.

Previous studies on the assessment of overall ecosystem service value (ESV) and ecological risk index (ERI) in winter cities are scarce. In this study, we constructed ESV and ERI measurement models using land use data in 2000, 2010, and 2020 using the improved value per unit area factor method and the landscape pattern index method, respectively, to reveal their spatial and temporal change characteristics. Geographic detectors were used to explore the driving roles of natural and artificial factors on the changes of ESV and ERI. The combination in ESV and ERI can then provide a more quantitative and accurate basis for policy decisions, identify priority areas for urban ecological restoration, and reduce the risk to ecosystems. The results of the study show that the total ESV of Shenyang city decreased from 273.97 x 108 CNY to 270.38 x 108 CNY during 2000-2020. Although the decrease is not large, the ESV changes structurally with the advancement of urbanization. During the 20 years, the construction land with the lowest ecological service function continues to expand, increasing by 354 km2, the grassland decreased by 215.9 km2, and the arable land decreased by 196.6 km2. The ecological service function of the water area is the strongest, with an increase of 51.3 km2 in the water area, ensuring that there is no significant decline in ESV. The size of the ERI is Very high, High, and Medium value zones remained relatively stable, while the size of the Very Low-value zone decreased by 12.78% and the size of the Low-value zone increased by 13.21%. The interaction factors that contributed most to the changes in ESV and ERI were annual evapotranspiration (EVP)/ Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Annual sunshine hours (SSD)/ Digital Elevation Model (DEM) , respectively. There was a spatial correlation between ESV and ERI. The areas with the highest ESV supply capacity and at the same time facing severe ecological risks to the landscape pattern are distributed in the northeastern hilly lands.

Here we use airborne measurements from the 2018 Western Wildfire Experiment for Cloud Chemistry, Aerosol Absorption, and Nitrogen (WE-CAN) to parameterize emissions of reactive nitrogen (NOy) from wildfires into peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN; 37%), NO3- (27%), and NO (36%) in a global chemistry-climate model with 13 km spatial resolution over the contiguous US. The NOy partitioning, compared with emitting all NOy as NO, reduces model ozone bias in near-fire smoke plumes sampled by the aircraft and enhances ozone downwind by 5-10 ppbv when Canadian smoke plumes travel to Washington, Utah, Colorado, and Texas. Using multi-platform observations, we identify the smoke-influenced days with daily maximum 8-hr average (MDA8) ozone of 70-88 ppbv in Kennewick, Salt Lake City, Denver and Dallas. On these days, wildfire smoke enhanced MDA8 ozone by 5-25 ppbv, through ozone produced remotely during plume transport and locally via interactions of smoke plume with urban emissions.Wildfires have torn across western North America over the last decade. Smoke from wildland fires in Canada can travel thousands of kilometers to US cities and reacts with urban pollution to create harmful ozone, a criteria pollutant regulated by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Accurately quantifying this impact is needed to inform US air quality policy, but is challenging due to complex physical and chemical processes. In this study, we analyze surface and airborne measurements, alongside a new variable-resolution global chemistry-climate model, to better understand these processes. We show that the near-field conversion of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from wildfires to peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) and other more oxidized forms reduces their localized impacts on ozone. PAN is the principal tropospheric reservoir for NOx radicals. When aged smoke plumes descend southward from Canada toward US cities, higher temperatures cause PAN to decompose and thus help production of ozone during smoke transport. On days when the observed ozone levels exceed the air quality limit (70 ppbv for 8-hr average), wildfire smoke can contribute 5-25 ppbv.Sequestration of wildfire NOx emissions in Canada as peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) enhances the downwind impacts on US O3 air quality Pyrogenic volatile organic compounds and PAN decomposition increase the contribution of aged Canadian smoke plumes to O3 in US cities Accounting for these effects in a high-resolution chemistry-climate model improves simulation of smoke-impacted high-O3 events in US cities",wildfire smoke,urban ozone,reactive nitrogen,long-range transport,,,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,air quality,climate change,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We focus on a case study from the southern French Alps (the Bleone Valley), for which a rich historical corpus but little palaeoenvironmental data are available. We compared and contrasted (i) pedoanthracological data obtained along an altitudinal transect (ca 400 m), (ii) dendrochronological data from historical buildings and old living trees, and (iii) historical data from written sources on forest management and land-use change. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that the comparison between different proxy data to understand the history of mountain forest ecosystems and human- forest interactions is very challenging. We show that the spatial distribution of forest and treeline position have been impacted by human activities, mainly due to agro-sylvo-pastoral practices through the use of fire and forest cutting to maintain open pasture lands and local building purposes. Despite centuries of local agro-sylvo-pastoral activities, the forest composition has remained relatively unchanged since the Middle Ages. Our comparison of historical documents with dendrochronological data on local buildings and soil charcoal data shows that the local demands of wood cannot explain the observed large-scale changes in forest spatial continuity. Curiously, the highest demand for wood by local residents did not occur in pace with modern demographic boom (17th century), as would be expected. Thus, we suggest that supra-regional external regulations and State's control played a more important role in forest management. Royal shipbuilding industry, more lucrative economic stakes, and expanded demand for timber for construction of buildings in urban areas of the lower valleys and plains are among the external factors which impacted forest exploitation during periods when logging was prohibited.",Historical Ecology,Tree rings,Soil charcoal,Historical archives,,,QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL,Forest management,Agro-sylvo-pastoralism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results indicate that a future trend of urban land expansion, particularly in the economic scenario (LU_SSP585), leads to weakened environmental ecosystems, while the sustainable scenario (LU_SSP126) exhibits more balanced land development. The MIROC-ES2L model demonstrates higher Taylor skill scores, forecasted significant increases in precipitation, maximum, and minimum temperatures under the SSP585 scenario. Spatial heterogeneity in TN and TP loads is notable, showing an upward trajectory in the future. The interaction between land-use and climate change has complex effects on TN and TP loads, with land-use-induced TN changes being relatively small (4.6 %) and TP changes substantial (24.3 %). The spatial distribution, under overlying effects, leans towards the influence of climate change, emphasizing its dominant role in TN and TP load variations. Distinct differences exist in the reduction of NPS pollution loads among different BMPs, with combined BMPs demonstrating superior effectiveness. The environmental-cost effectiveness trends of BMPs remain consistent across various future scenarios.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for comprehensive and detailed information regarding land systems. Here, we developed the first fine-scale dataset of the China Land System at a spatial resolution of 1 km, covering the period from 2000 to 2015. By leveraging this comprehensive land information, we identified five primary types of land systems and their respective subsystems, thereby delineating distinct patterns of human-environmental interaction. Land system dynamics followed diverse developmental trajectories characterized by incremental shifts toward more functionally centralized systems. Land use intensification played a significant role in increasing the population capacity and food production in China, contributing nearly 93.94% and 84.99%, respectively. In contrast, land cover changes accounted for only 4.69% and 11.43%, respectively. These findings underscore the tendency of previous studies to overestimate the impact of land cover change and underestimate the influence of land use intensification in meeting the growing demands of land-based production.

Over the past 20 years, areas of extreme and high vulnerability have significantly decreased, while areas of potential vulnerability and slight vulnerability have increased. (2) The key factors impacting ecological vulnerability during this period included industrial water use, SO2 emissions, industrial wastewater, and ecological water use. (3) Areas primarily hindering the transition to potential vulnerability are concentrated in well-developed small urban regions within basins. Furthermore, natural factors like altitude and temperature, which cannot be artificially regulated, are the major impediments to future ecological restoration. Therefore, this paper recommends natural restoration strategies based on environmental protection and governance strategies that prioritize green development as complementary measures. The discoveries of the paper provide a novel analytical method for the study of ecological vulnerability in mountainous areas, offering valuable insights for enhancing the accuracy of ecological risk prediction, fostering the integration of interdisciplinary research, and optimizing environmental governance and protection strategies.",ecological vulnerability,Qinling-Daba Mountain Area,VSD model,Bayesian network model,,,SUSTAINABILITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The interactions among these spheres collectively impact the changes of the climate system. Natural disasters represent the most intense manifestation of the interactions among the Earth's spheres, and they have profound impacts on human society. In this study, we discuss the impact of climate change on natural disasters by examining the characteristics of climate change-induced hazards and the activity patterns of natural disasters. Furthermore, the response mechanisms of natural disasters to climate change are elaborated by exploring the formation and evolution of different types of natural disasters. Additionally, the future trends of disaster-pregnant environment under climate change are estimated, and the future trends of disaster risk are revealed by jointly considering the exposure and vulnerability.The main driving forces and formation conditions of natural disasters vary greatly among different geomorphic units, but they can generally be classified into three categories: Thermally driven disasters, gravitationally driven disasters, and hydrologically driven disasters. For example, heatwaves, tropical cyclones, tornadoes, and wildfires are common examples of thermally driven disasters which are forced by high temperatures or great thermal gradients. In addition, gravitationally driven disasters mainly occur in mountainous areas with significant differences in elevation, such as landslides, snow-ice avalanches and debris flows. The tsunamis caused by seabed movement are also gravity disasters. Furthermore, the disasters such as droughts, regional floods and sea-level rise are primarily driven by the changes in hydraulic conditions, and thus are classified as hydrologically driven disasters.In the context of enhanced climate change, the interactions among multiple spheres of the Earth's system are strengthened, causing the disaster-pregnant environment to evolve towards a more vulnerable state. Thus, the natural disasters present some new characteristics and trends, and the disaster risk shows a sharp increase. The interactions among different types of natural disasters have also become stronger, resulting in a significant rise in the risk of compound and cascading disaster. The differences in driving forces lead to significant variations in the disaster feedback to climate change among the varied geomorphic units. For example, the strengthened interaction between ocean and atmosphere leads to enhanced compound risk and destructive power of marine disasters. Besides, the intensification of water cycle contributes to increased spatial heterogeneity in drought and flood disasters, whose durations, intensities, and magnitudes show significant increasing trends. In addition, the high mountainous areas with altitude-dependent warming and the urban areas with significant heat island effects have obvious amplification effects in the responses to climate warming.This study advocates the goal of improving the accuracy and effectiveness of natural disaster prediction and early warning, and reducing the risk of climate change-related disasters. Five major scientific challenges of climate change-related disaster risk are proposed: (1) The mechanisms of climate change-driven interactions among Earth's spheres and the coupling of internal and external forces; (2) the spatio-temporal patterns of disaster development across different scales; (3) the perception of extreme event information and the data-driven risk identification; (4) the dynamics of disasters and the evolution of risk; (5) the disaster risk management and the resilient social development. By addressing the key issues in these five challenges through comprehensive and diversified approaches, we can deepen our scientific understanding on the Earth's system, adapt to global changes, and reduce disaster risks.",climate change,natural hazards,disaster effects,response mechanisms,"Tang, Jinbo","Ou, Tinghai",CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE,scientific challenges,,,,,,,,"Hao, Jiansheng","Wang, Jiao",,,"Zhang, Guotao","Lei, Yu","Wu, Chunhao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The changing spatial and temporal patterns of rainfall, along with the competing demands from urban development and tourism, necessitate precise adjustments in resource allocation and management strategies. Effective and secure water supply management requires a comprehensive knowledge of aquifer behavior and possible interactions with surface water flows in adjacent rivers. The optimal approach to comprehend the behavior of the aquifer involves developing a 3D physically based hydrodynamic model that encapsulates all relevant physical processes. The hydrogeological tool was used to model the groundwater system in the Cagne catchment and assess its response to different hydrological scenarios. The model was set up with a resolution of 5 m in the river area and 100 m in the other areas to provide a detailed representation of the hydrological processes involved, and 5 layers were created in the underground part based on geological data. The model was validated using data from the 2015-2017 two-year event, which covered a full annual cycle of recharge and discharge. The results showed that the model was able to accurately predict the behaviour of the groundwater system in the Cagne catchment, both in terms of the distribution of water resources and the impact of changing hydrological conditions. Overall, this study provides a valuable contribution to the understanding of groundwater management in the Cagne catchment. By providing a comprehensive and accurate representation of the groundwater system, this study can inform future management decisions and help to ensure the long-term sustainability of the region's water resources.",Groundwater management,FEFLOW,3D modelling,Cagne catchment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The quantification and mapping of social vulnerability, coupled with hazard assessment, could be a useful approach to support risk management strategies. With this aim, we carried on a systematic review on the role of social vulnerability in the natural hazard literature in the European Economic Area (EEA) and United Kingdom (UK) over the last twenty years. The various definitions, measurements and mapping of social vulnerability were studied, providing an instrument for conducting hazard assessment and demonstrating the relevance of multidisciplinary approach in disasters research. The PRISMA methodology and frequency analysis were used to extract and analyze the literature. According to our selection criteria, 95 papers were included in the final analysis. Results revealed that: i) 53 % of papers focuses on social vulnerability related to flood hazard, ii) 61 % of case studies include hazard assessment, while the rest only investigate the socio-economic component of vulnerability, iii) Portugal and Italy are the most investigated countries, iv) 51,6 % of papers carry out an integrated approach. The review underlines a pronounced perception of the scientific community to the more recurrent events (floods) rather than to the number of deaths (heat waves), leading to a discussion on the effected of climate change and suggestions for emergency planning in highly developed countries.

However, this may evolve into a considerably polluted region owing to increasing anthropogenic pollutants. In this study, we employ a multidisciplinary approach to analyze the surface sediments collected from the offshore area of the southern SCS. Our aim is to explore potential anthropogenic pollutants, their interactions, and the related controlling factors. This research endeavors to enhance our understanding of the current pollution status in the SCS and help making relevant policy management decisions. Comparison with previous reports reveals that now, the area is more extensively and increasingly contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons and heavy metals (Cd and As) than before. For the first time, we report the recognition of coprostanol and long-chain alkyl mid-chain ketones, unveiling the noticeable incorporation of sewage fecal matter and biomass burning into offshore sediments. Moreover, sedimentary multipollutants (except ketones) exhibit strong correlations with terrestrial elements and fine-sized particles, displaying a roughly highwest/low-east spatial variability in pollutant accumulation or enrichment. These signatures evidently demonstrate the major impact of river discharges (e.g., the Mekong River to the west and the Pearl and Red Rivers to the north) on the SCS. They have hydrodynamic effects on the subsequent basin-wide dispersal of pollutants, driven by monsoon-induced large- and regional-scale currents. The different behavior of burning-related ketones may be partly due to their aerosol form, leading to atmospheric transportation.

Harvester ants consume seeds and are often found in arid areas. They frequently alter the soil chemistry and bulk density of the soils in and around their nest sites. Many species of harvester ants also intentionally remove vegetation around their nest openings, which creates cones or discs of bare soil that may further alter soil temperatures. However, much of the work to study the impacts of harvester ants on soil properties has occurred in shrubland and grassland settings rather than suburban environments. We aimed to determine if Pogonomyrmex barbatus (Smith) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) nests in a suburban habitat in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas with similarly altered soil properties. First, we measured the disc size of the active nests to determine the changes and persistence of the colony. We then assessed the soil compaction and surface temperature along a gradient centered on the disc. We found that disc size did not increase throughout the two-year observation period and that nests with smaller discs were less likely to persist between years. While we did not observe any changes in the surface temperature across the gradient, we found significantly reduced soil compaction closer to the center of the disc. These data indicate that an increase in nest size increases the extent of soil impacted. The impacts of nests reduced soil compaction, particularly within a suburban landscape with precipitation run-off issues and a highly disturbed plant community should be addressed in future studies.",Seed preference,fungal infection,ant-seed interactions,Lower Rio Grande Valley,"Choudhury, Robin A.",,SOUTHWESTERN ENTOMOLOGIST,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epidemiological studies have evidenced the increased damage to human health on a daily basis because of damage to the ecological niche. Rapid urban growth and industrialized societies importantly compromise air quality, which can be assessed by a notable accumulation of air pollutants in both the gas and the particle phases. Of them, particulate matter (PM) represents a highly complex mixture of organic and inorganic compounds of the most variable size, composition, and origin. PM being one of the most complex environmental pollutants, its accumulation also varies in a temporal and spatial manner, which challenges current analytical techniques used to investigate PM interactions. Nevertheless, the characterization of the chemical composition of PM is a reliable indicator of the composition of the atmosphere, the quality of breathed air in urbanized societies, industrial zones and consequently gives support for pertinent measures to avoid serious health damage. Epigenomic damage is one of the most promising biological mechanisms of air pollution-derived carcinogenesis. Therefore, this review aims to highlight the implication of PM exposure in diverse molecular mechanisms driving human diseases by altered epigenetic regulation. The presented findings in the context of pan-organic cancer, fibrosis, neurodegeneration and metabolic diseases may provide valuable insights into the toxicity effects of PM components at the epigenomic level and may serve as biomarkers of early detection for novel targeted therapies.",air pollution,epigenetic regulation,cancer,neurotoxicity,"Manuel-Sanchez, Dulce Maria","Molina-Herrera, Alejandro",FRONTIERS IN GENETICS,metabolism,fibrosis,oxidative stress,transgenerational epigenetics,,,,,"Coral-Garcia, Miguel Angel","Anastasio, Estela",,,"Anaya-Hernandez, Arely","Lopez-Salazar, Primavera","Juarez-Diaz, Gabriel","Martinez-Juarez, Javier","Torres-Jacome, Julian","Albarado-Ibanez, Alondra","Martinez-Laguna, Ygnacio","Moran, Carolina","Rubio, Karla",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lack of adaptability in planning has led to increased social conflicts and many environmental issues, especially in global southern countries. Paying attention to the context in which LUP takes place is necessary to adapt to the nonlinear land-use changes. LUP theories have formed two general processes including top-down (comprehensive planning) and bottom-up (collaborative planning) processes to influence land use. However, the processes that shape the transformations of land uses are more sophisticated than being placed in this or that theory. Land-use transformations are rooted in contextual conditions that are shaped by the mutual interactions of social structures and power relations at different spatial levels which are different for each society. This research explores the challenges of the incompatibility of LUP general processes with contextual conditions. The study reviews the compliance of contextual conditions with the LUP main elements, including cognition, decision-making process, goal setting, and policy selection. The results showed that LUP to comply with the multi-layer nature of various situations needs a continuous connection of its elements. Efficient knowledge of changing forces enables planning adaptability and flexibility. This knowledge provides the opportunity to redefine the decision-making process.

By taking into account the strong interaction effects often observed in real phenomena, we aim to obtain an improved measure of edge usage during rush hours as traffic congestion patterns emerge in urban networks. In this approach, the network is iteratively populated by agents following dynamically evolving fastest paths who are progressively attracted towards uncongested parts of the network as the global traffic volume increases. Following the transition of the network state from empty to saturated, we study the emergence of congestion and the progressive disruption of global connectivity due to a relatively small fraction of crowded edges. We assess the predictive power of our model by comparing the speed distribution against a large experimental data set for the London area with remarkable results, which also translate into a qualitative similarity of the congestion maps. Also, percolation analysis confirms the quantitative agreement of the model with the real data for London. We perform simulations for seven other topologically different cities to obtain the Fisher critical exponent tau that shows no common functional dependence on the traffic level. The critical exponent gamma , studied to assess the power -law decay of spatial correlation, is found to be inversely proportional to the number of vehicles for both real and simulated traffic.

Existing studies on determinant factors affecting property prices, including air pollution, mainly employed hedonic and spatial regression models that have limitations in capturing non-linear relationships and local interactions. Neglecting the non-linear relationships can lead to incomplete estimation impacts between explainable features and prices. To fill these gaps, this study used machine learning algorithms and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to identify the relative importance of air pollutant variables on land values and their non-linear mechanism. The results showed that the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) outperformed Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), and Extra Tree Regression (ETR) models in price prediction and capturing the non-linear relationship between air pollution and land values. Notably, Ozone (O3) and Nitric Oxide (NO) concentrations contribute 1.64% and 1.47% to land value variation, respectively. The results confirmed the non-linear relationship and identified that the threshold effect between air pollution and land values is at mean concentration values. Furthermore, we observed that the negative influence of O3 and NO on land values appears as their concentration level is higher than 29.3 and 13 ppb, respectively.

However, few countries have currently achieved these targets, posing challenges to the realization of the UNAIDS goal to eliminate the global HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030. The Chinese government has implemented corresponding policies for HIV/AIDS prevention and control; however, it still faces the challenge of a large number of HIV/AIDS cases. Existing research predominantly focuses on the study of a particular region or population in China, and there is relatively limited research on the macro-level analysis of the spatio temporal distribution of HIV/AIDS across China and its association with socioeconomic factors. Objective: This study seeks to identify the impact of these factors on the spatiotemporal distribution of HIV/AIDS incidence in China, aiming to provide scientific recommendations for future policy development. Methods: This study employed ArcGIS 10.2 (Esri) for spatial analysis, encompassing measures such as the imbalance index, geographical concentration index, spatial autocorrelation analysis (Moran I), and hot spot analysis (Getis-Ord Gi*). These methods were used to unveil the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of HIV/AIDS incidence in 31 provinces of China from 2009to 2019. Geographical Detector was used for ecological detection, risk area detection, factor detection, and interaction detection. The analysis focused on 9 selected socioeconomic indicators to further investigate the influence of socioeconomic factors onHIV/AIDS incidence in China. Results: The spatiotemporal distribution analysis of HIV/AIDS incidence in China from 2009 to 2019 revealed distinct patterns. The spatial distribution type of HIV/AIDS incidence in China was random in 2009-2010. However, from 2011 to 2019, thedistribution pattern evolved toward a clustered arrangement, with the degree of clustering increasing each year. Notably, from2012 onwards, there was a significant and rapid growth in the aggregation of cold and hot spot clusters of HIV/AIDS incidencein China, stabilizing only by the year 2016. An analysis of the impact of socioeconomic factors on HIV/AIDS incidence in Chinahighlighted the ""urbanization rate"" and ""urban basic medical insurance fund expenditure"" as the primary factors influencing thespatial distribution of HIV/AIDS incidence. Additionally, among social factors, indicators related to medical resources exerteda crucial influence on HIV/AIDS incidence. Conclusions: From 2009 to 2019, HIV/AIDS incidence in China was influenced by various socioeconomic factors. In the future,it is imperative to optimize the combination of different socioeconomic indicators based on regional incidence patterns. Thisoptimization will facilitate the formulation of corresponding policies to address the challenges posed by the HIV/AIDS epidemic.",HIV/AIDS,spatiotemporal distribution,cluster analysis,socioeconomic factors,,,JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Direct sources include chemical production from other VOCs and anthropogenic emissions, terrestrial vegetation, biomass-burning emissions, and ocean production. Sinks include chemical loss, deposition onto the land surface, and ocean uptake. Acetone also has a lifetime that is long enough to allow transport and reactions with other compounds remote from its sources. The NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) Earth system model ModelE2.1 simulates a variety of Earth system interactions. Previously, acetone had a very simplistic representation in the ModelE chemical scheme. This study assesses a more sophisticated acetone scheme in which acetone is a full 3-dimensional tracer with explicit sources, sinks, and atmospheric transport. We first evaluate the new global acetone budget in the context of past literature. Estimated source and sink fluxes fall within the range of previous models, although total atmospheric burden and lifetime are at the lower end of the published literature. Acetone's new representation in ModelE2.1 also results in more realistic spatial and vertical distributions, which we compare against previous models and field observations. The seasonality of acetone-related processes was also studied in conjunction with field measurements, and these comparisons show promising agreement but also shortcomings at high-emission urban locations, where the model's resolution is too coarse to capture the true behavior. Finally, we conduct a variety of sensitivity studies that explore the influence of key parameters on the acetone budget and its global distribution. An impactful finding is that the production of acetone from precursor hydrocarbon oxidation has strong leverage on the overall chemical source, indicating the importance of accurate molar yields. Overall, our implementation is one that corroborates with previous studies and marks a significant improvement in the development of the acetone tracer in GISS ModelE2.1.",,,,,,,GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is known that the built environment can influence travel attitudes and choice, yet the empirical evidence for the role of built environment features in shaping the bicycle-metro integration remains rare. Inspired by the idea of text mining, this article is an attempt to demonstrate a data-driven semantic framework to capture key topic-based features of land use and bicycle-metro integrated usage in the vicinity of metro stations as well as their interactions. Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling is analogously implemented here to generate a range of probability-based land use patterns and mobility patterns, and the associations between them are investigated by multivariate linear regression. A case study from Shanghai shows that the mixed land use and diversification of urban functions in the catchment areas of the metro stations can be detected effectively by 11 identified land use patterns. Based on 7 derived mobility patterns, this paper gives a probabilistic explanation to the time-varying properties of the bicycle-metro usage. All of the above thematic topics exhibit notably heterogeneous patterns in spatial distribution. The topic compositions in terms of land use pattern and mobility pattern at the station level reveal the current performance of station areas. Plus, results from the regression analysis confirm that most of the land use patterns that are related to various mixed use have close relationships with mobility patterns of bicycle-metro integration. Yet it is noteworthy that the effects of land use patterns often differ and change over time, namely affecting different mobility patterns. This study gives rise to alternative insights into the synergy between bike sharing and metro, which may help policymakers to develop more targeted TOD strategies.",Bike sharing,Bicycle -metro integration,Built environment,Topic model,,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,Transport policy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified the most frequent vectors, reservoirs, and hosts, the most prevalent infections, and the factors associated with transmission risk and the anthropogenic landscape modification in urban, rural, ecotone, and sylvatic habitats. The most relevant pathogens of zoonotic risk included Trypanosoma cruzi, arboviruses, Leishmania, Rickettsia, Leptospira, and Toxoplasma gondii. Trypanosoma cruzi was the vector-borne agent with the largest number of infected vertebrate species across habitats, while Leishmania and arboviruses were the ones that affected the greatest number of people. Dogs, cats, backyard animals, and their hematophagous ectoparasites are the most likely species maintaining the transmission cycles in human settlements, while rodents, opossums, bats, and other synanthropic animals facilitate connection and transmission cycles between forested habitats with human-modified landscapes. Pathogens displayed different prevalences between the landscapes, T. cruzi, arbovirus, and Leptospira infections were the most prevalent in urban and rural settlements, whereas Leishmania and Rickettsia had similar prevalence across habitats, likely due to the diversity and abundance of the infected vectors involved. The prevalence of T. gondii and Leptospira spp. may reflect poor hygiene conditions. Additionally, results suggest that prevalence of zoonotic and vector-borne diseases is higher in deforested areas and agricultural aggregates, and in sites with precarious health and infrastructure services.Conclusions Some hosts, vectors, and transmission trends of zoonotic and vector-borne diseases in the YP are well known but others remain poorly recognized. It is imperative to reinforce practices aimed at increasing the knowledge, monitoring, prevention, and control of these diseases at the regional level. We also emphasize the need to perform studies on a larger spatio-temporal scale under the socio-ecosystem perspective, to better elucidate the interactions between pathogens, hosts, vectors, environment, and sociocultural and economic aspects in this and many other tropical regions.Modification of the landscape and ecosystems is tightly linked with the transmission of zoonotic and vector-biorne diseases, with crucial consequences on public health. We reviewed the published literature (2015-2024) on the most frequent vectors, reservoirs and hosts, the prevalent infections, as well as the factors associated with transmission risk and the anthropogenic landscape modification in the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. The most relevant pathogens of zoonotic risk included Trypanosoma cruzi, arboviruses, Leishmania, Rickettsia, Leptospira, and Toxoplasma gondii. Our summary suggests that prevalence is higher in deforested areas and agricultural aggregates, and in sites with precarious health and infrastructure services. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of zoonotic agents in the peninsula highlights the need to better understand the impact of land use changes on zoonoses.",,,,,"Falcon, Luisa I.","Vazquez-Dominguez, Ella",PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This proof-of-concept study presents the development of a Social Physical Activity Index for Area (SPAIFA) an indicator reflecting opportunities for individuals to actively participate as part of a group within which opportunities for social interaction can be developed. Methods: Six government councils in the state of New South Wales, Australia, were selected encompassing 174 suburbs. Using 2 search engines ' map tools, we identi fi ed PA venues for each suburb (eg, park, studios, etc). To enumerate activities per suburb, we used (1) venue websites, (2) New South Wales Office of Sport website, (3) national websites of grassroots PA for nonorganized activity (eg, parkrun , meetup, etc), and (4) social media. The database was linked to the suburb demographic pro fi le, the area disadvantage score, walkability and open space scores, and the proportion of insuf fi ciently active residents. Spatial analysis techniques were used to identify SPAIFA clusters. Results: SPAIFA councils ' average was 9.9 activities per 10,000 people (ranging from 6.6/10,000 to 16.2/10,000). SPAIFA-Old (ie, activities speci fi c to older adults) varied signi fi cantly (ranging from 11.7/10,000 to 0.8/10,000 seniors). Disadvantaged areas and a high proportion of insuf fi ciently active residents were associated with being classi fi ed as low SPAIFA ( P < .01). Three clusters of low SPAIFA were identi fi ed, and 17 high -risk areas where low SPAIFA was compounded by poor environmental support. Conclusions: SPAIFA can be used by councils and policymakers as an indicator for monitoring and intervening in areas where natural and/or urban design is not conducive for PA.",social environment,index,GIS,cross-sectional,,,JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY & HEALTH,councils,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The central region of Gennargentu-Mandrolisai in Sardinia (Italy) is particularly susceptible to this trend due to its distinctive topography, its remote localisation and the distance from the primary urban centres of the region. In fact, this region was traditionally suited for agro-silvopastoral systems, but it was included in the national strategy for inland areas mainly because of the demographic decline and land abandonment. This paper aims to identify the main drivers of rural marginalisation, abandonment and deanthropisation by combining qualitative and quantitative spatial data. Qualitative data were collected from 30 farmers' interviews targeting young, dynamic, innovative farmers in order to identify possible triggers for maintaining agricultural activities. A diachronic analysis of land use from Corine Land Cover maps at five different dates over thirty years (1990, 2000, 2006, 2012 and 2018) was used to understand the main land use changes. The analysis of the surveyed farmland (1602 ha) showed that 21 % of the area was abandoned in the last three decades, and 15 % of abandoned land was recovered as farmland. The drivers of marginalisation identified by the farmers were analysed by a logistic regression model, which revealed that field management was influenced by 'crop type', 'slope' and 'road distance from the farm buildings'. The interactions that arose between the natural characteristics and the traditional organisational system contributed to non-competitiveness and abandonment of farms in Gennargentu-Mandrolisai. The present data allow us to propose hypotheses on how agricultural activities could be shaped and how some drivers of marginality could be overcome thanks to the presence and the active work of many young farmers who are willing to further improve agriculture.",Farmland abandonment,Drivers of marginalisation,Farmers' interviews,Logistic regression model,,,CATENA,Gennargentu-Mandrolisai,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We convened a multistakeholder intersectoral collaborative group that developed a digital, web-based platform integrating open and big data to derive dynamic spatial - temporal accessibility measurements (DSTAM) for haemodialysis services. We worked with stakeholders and data scientists and considered people ' s places of residence, service locations, and travel time to the service with the shortest travel time. Additionally, we predicted the impacts of strategically introducing haemodialysis services where they optimise accessibility. Methods Cross-sectional analyses of DSTAM, accounting for traf fi c congestion, were conducted using a web-based platform. This platform integrated traf fi c analysis zones, public census and health services datasets, and Google Distance Matrix API travel-time data. Predictive and prescriptive analytics identi fi ed optimal locations for new haemodialysis services and estimated improvements. Primary outcomes included the percentage of residents within a 20-min car drive of a haemodialysis service during peak and free- fl ow traf fi c congestion. Secondary outcomes focused on optimal locations to maximise accessibility with new services and potential improvements. Findings were disaggregated by sociodemographic characteristics, providing an equity perspective. The study in Cali, Colombia, used geographic and disaggregated sociodemographic data from the adjusted 2018 Colombian census. Predicted travel times were obtained for two weeks in 2020. Findings There were substantial traf fi c variations. Congestion reduced accessibility, especially among marginalised groups. For 6 - 12 July, free- fl ow and peak-traf fi c accessibility rates were 95.2% and 45.0%, respectively. For 23 - 29 November, free- fl ow and peak traf fi c accessibility rates were 89.1% and 69.7%. The locations where new services would optimise accessibility had slight variation and would notably enhance accessibility and health equity. Interpretation Establishing haemodialysis services in targeted areas has signi fi cant potential bene fi ts. By increasing accessibility, it would enhance urban health and equity.

Due to its high reactivity, this compound contributes significantly to the production of tropospheric ozone in polluted areas and to the formation of secondary organic aerosols.The assessment of biogenic emissions is of great importance for regional and global air quality evaluation. In this study, we implemented the biogenic emission model MEGANv2.1 (Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature, version 2.1) in the surface model SURFEXv8.1 (SURface EXternalis & eacute;e in French, version 8.1). This coupling aims to improve the estimation of biogenic emissions using the detailed vegetation-type-dependent treatment included in the SURFEX vegetation ISBA (Interaction between Soil Biosphere and Atmosphere) scheme. This scheme provides vegetation-dependent parameters such as leaf area index and soil moisture to MEGAN. This approach enables a more accurate estimation of biogenic fluxes compared to the stand-alone MEGAN model, which relies on average input values for all vegetation types.The present study focuses on the assessment of the SURFEX-MEGAN model isoprene emissions. An evaluation of the coupled SURFEX-MEGAN model results was carried out by conducting a global isoprene emission simulation in 2019 and by comparing the simulation results with other MEGAN-based isoprene inventories. The coupled model estimates a total global isoprene emission of 443 Tg in 2019. The estimated isoprene is within the range of results obtained with other MEGAN-based isoprene inventories, ranging from 311 to 637 Tg. The spatial distribution of SURFEX-MEGAN isoprene is consistent with other studies, with some differences located in low-isoprene-emission regions.Several sensitivity tests were conducted to quantify the impact of different model inputs and configurations on isoprene emissions. Using different meteorological forcings resulted in a +/- 5 % change in isoprene emissions using MERRA (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications) and IFS (Integrated Forecasting System) compared with ERA5. The impact of using different emission factor data was also investigated. The use of PFT (plant functional type) spatial coverage and PFT-dependent emission potential data resulted in a 12 % reduction compared to using the isoprene emission potential gridded map. A significant reduction of around 38 % in global isoprene emissions was observed in the third sensitivity analysis, which applied a parameterization of soil moisture deficit, particularly in certain regions of Australia, Africa, and South America.The significance of coupling the SURFEX and MEGAN models lies particularly in the ability of the coupled model to be forced with meteorological data from any period. This means, for instance, that this system can be used to predict biogenic emissions in the future. This aspect of our work is significant given the changes that biogenic organic compounds are expected to undergo as a result of changes in their climatic factors.",,,,,"Hamer, Paul David",,GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, existing literature provides limited insights into the internal mechanisms and pathways for achieving green transformation of agricultural clusters. To address the challenges in international research on the collaborative green transformation of entire agricultural value chains, a theoretical analysis framework is constructed in this study, which is characterized by ""point-line-plane three-layer embeddedness and four-force interaction,"" positioning green innovation as a pivotal entry point. Through social network analysis, this study examines the processes and mechanisms underlying the collaborative green transformation of agricultural clusters and proposes viable pathways for implementation using the Shouguang vegetable industrial cluster as a case study. The research findings are as follows: (1) The green transformation of agricultural clusters includes the green transformation of cluster behavior actors (point), formation of a green innovation network (line), construction of a green environment (plane), and embedded integration and coordinated transformation of the three. Green innovations generated by leading enterprises, universities, and research institutions serve as the foundation for this transformation, whereas farmers' adoption of these innovations forms the basis, and government policies provide regulatory environment to ensure successful implementation. The transformation is realized through green collaborative innovation and governance, achieving the ""three-layer embeddedness."" (2) Under the influence of four driving forces, namely, market-driven mechanisms, environmental regulations, green innovation, and multidimensional proximity, actors at various levels form and embed green innovation networks that are integrated into regional environments through institutional constraints. This results in a ""five-in-one"" system of collaborative green innovation and governance encompassing enterprises, industries, technologies, institutions, and spatial dimensions, which constitute the internal mechanisms for the green transformation and upgrading of agricultural clusters.

Numerous articles, research papers, and projects have been proposed and implemented, which can be broadly categorized into two approaches. The first approach focuses on the physical aspects and the built environment of historical fabrics, addressing the issues related to structures and their physical connections. The second approach presents behavioral, socio-cultural, and symbolic studies regarding historical fabrics. Neither of these two approaches, which provide a discrete and tangible understanding of these valuable places, has been able to be effectively implemented on its own. Therefore, the primary concern of this research is how to employ landscape-oriented approaches in preserving and revitalizing the values of historical fabrics and strengthening the collective memory as an influential factor in their sustainability within the reconstruction and revitalization programs. In this study, after defining the landscape and its relationship with place and the significant factors that enhance this relationship, the landscape and spatial characteristics of historical fabrics are analyzed. Furthermore, various opinions ofexperts in this field are examined and classified. The aim is to identify the landscape values and their impact on the identity of historical fabrics, formulating a general roadmap for their sustainable regeneration and revitalization. Various approaches and strategies have been proposed to conserve, restore, and revitalize historical fabrics in cities. However, in most cases, the role of landscape and landscape-oriented approaches as influential factors in reviving and retrieving their identities must be adequately emphasized. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to identify and utilize the landscape values and collective memories to develop a model for the sustainable revival and revitalization of historical fabrics that can effectively contribute to the interpretation and perception of the narratives of these places in interaction with the landscape. This study is an analytical-descriptive research methodology employing a case study approach. Data were collected through library and field research. It explores the relevant literature on the landscape, landscape-oriented approaches, place identity, sense of place, and their different dimensions. The landscape-oriented perspective, as a novel approach to the conservation and revitalization ofhistorical fabrics (as places), can assist in protecting their tangible and intangible values and ensuring their sustainability. Moreover, on a larger scale, it can contribute to preserving the historical narrative of cities. This aspect can significantly impact enhancing the sense of belonging among citizens, which is an influential factor in the continuity and sustainability ofa place. Historical fabrics inherently possess a wealthy textual content; any intervention, alteration, or interaction without understanding and perceiving the related narrative would be incomplete. In this regard, employing a landscape-oriented approach by strengthening the connection with the place is essential and valuable. Integrating landscape-oriented approaches in revitalizing and restoring historical fabrics can enable a correct interpretation of the landscape narrative and the historical narrative of the place within historical fabrics and contribute to their sustainable stability.",Landscape,Landscape approaches,Sustainability,Historical urban fabrics,,,MANZAR-THE SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL OF LANDSCAPE,Revitalization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conducting management for such a hybrid multi-modal system faces various challenges, including the complex interactions between bike-sharing and other modes, highly dynamic passenger demand, and the difficulty of accessing direct transfer data. To overcome such difficulties, our study proposes a framework for assessing the dependency between the two usage modes. Firstly, a Dynamic-Time-Warping-based (DTW) method is utilized to determine the catchment area (CA) between the two modes, allowing the BnR-related tendency similarity under a given time scale to be considered. Then, the patterns of probabilistic dependence between travel demand of the two modes are obtained by a copula-based approach, which separates correlations under specific usage levels from single modal demands. A case study on the multi-modal system formed by docked bike-sharing and subway in New York is conducted to validate the proposed framework. The tendency similarity is found to be most pronounced within 500 m on average under a 4-hour interval. For each formed station group (SG), the best-fitted copula type is selected, capturing the strong tail correlations present only at specific usage levels. The results show a variety of different correlation patterns within SGs, despite the close geographic locations they may share. Areas of potential transfer resistance between the two modes are identified, which is more evident in first-milerelated (FMR) activities. In contrast, the two modes display more weak connections in last-mile-related (LMR) activities. The obtained results can be utilized by bike-sharing service providers to analyze demand distributions and conduct efficient station-level rebalancing. Compared to previous methods, our proposed framework is computationally inexpensive since no direct transfer of data or complex inference network is required. It incorporates statistically significant spatial-temporal information, allowing for a more accurate determination of the bi-modal assessment range. Moreover, considering that single-mode influences are mathematically removed, the resulting correlation in principle links to the strength of the connections between the two modes. Therefore, it can be assessed as an indicator of the reliability of the multi-modal system.",Docked bike-sharing,Multi-modal system,Catchment area,Demand dependence,,,TRAVEL BEHAVIOUR AND SOCIETY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They contribute to soil stabilization, regulation of soil water content, and act as robust structures impeding the downstream progression of debris flows. On the positive side, trees, to some extent, can intercept debris flows and effectively mitigate their velocity by increasing flow resistance. On the negative side, trees may suffer damage from debris-flow hazards, characterized by the generation of substantial quantities of wood fragments and consequential ramifications such as river channel blockage, resulting in backwater rise. In extreme cases, this blockage collapse can lead to instantaneous discharge amplification, thereby adversely impacting urban safety and impeding sustainable development. Therefore, in order to grasp the effects of tree characteristics on tree failure modes, the tree failure modes and corresponding parameters, diameters at breast height (DBH) and root-soil plate size, were identified and recorded through the post-event field investigation in Keze Gully, a region prone to debris-flow events in Sichuan, China, respectively. To investigate the impact of spatial variability in tree root distribution on tree failure modes, the root cross-sectional area ratio (RAR), root density (RD), root length density (RLD) and soil detachment rate (SDR) were obtained. The findings indicated that: (1) Tree characteristics reflect the interactions of debris flows and trees, and influence the tree failure modes ultimately. The root distribution characteristics influence the size and shape of the root-soil plate to affect the resistance of trees. (2) Compared to burial and abrasion, stem breakage and overturning are the predominant modes of tree failure in debris-flow hazards. Trees with a smaller DBH primarily experience stem breakage and bending, and trees with a larger DBH mostly experience overturning. (3) The root-soil plate shapes of overturned trees, affected by the root architecture and root growth range, are generally semielliptical or semicircular, and the horizontal and vertical radii increase with DBH, but the correlation between the root-soil plate's breadth-depth ratio and DBH is low. (4) The biomass and RAR decrease with distance. The RAR distribution exhibit the order of upslope direction > downslope direction > lateral direction. The coarse root biomass significantly increases with DBH, but no clear trend in fine root biomass. (5) The roots can significantly enhance the soil erosion resistance, but the erosion resistance of coarse roots is not as significant as that of fine roots. The erosion resistance increases with DBH, and follows the order of upslope direction > downslope direction > lateral direction.

To assess these factors, 13 water quality and ecological indicators were monitored over a 14month period. Chlorophyll-a concentrations in Shiyan Reservoir ranged from 21.25 to 88.77 mu g/L, with pronounced temporal heterogeneity and substantial variation. The highest chlorophyll-a levels, averaging around 85 mu g/L, were recorded from April to July, indicating a high risk of algal blooms during this period. The reservoir's annual average water temperature (WT) was 25.31 degrees C, with temperatures rising to approximately 30 degrees C from May to September, further increasing bloom risk. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) ranged from 1.71 to 3.08 mg/L, and total organic carbon (TOC) varied from 2.22 to 5.13 mg/L, indicating minimal organic pollution that meets Class I surface water standards. However, total nitrogen (TN) pollution remains severe, with concentrations between 1.66 and 2.49 mg/L, aligning with Class V surface water standards. Although recent reductions in TN levels have been observed, it continues to be the primary pollutant in the reservoir. Total phosphorus (TP) concentrations, ranging from 0.01 to 0.043 mg/L, are sufficiently low to meet Class I-II surface water standards. The reservoir's monthly average integrated trophic state index fluctuated between 43.13 and 53.81, with an annual average of 50.49, indicating a state of light eutrophication from April to May and moderate eutrophication in other months. Correlation analyses revealed WT as the primary factor influencing phytoplankton dynamics during the flood season, with a correlation coefficient of 0.69. In the flood season, WT, TOC, nitrate nitrogen, and transparency were the main factors affecting phytoplankton growth, while in the dry season, TOC, dissolved oxygen (DO), and WT were the primary drivers. Two-way ANOVA results indicated that temporal factors and sampling location, along with their interactions, explained the variations in environmental factors, with temporal heterogeneity significantly exceeding spatial heterogeneity. Cyanobacteria dominated from May to October, while diatoms were prevalent from November to February. Correlation and canonical correspondence analyses (CCA) highlighted significant differences in the environmental drivers of cyanobacteria, diatoms, and green algae. WT was the primary influencing factor for all three algae types, while organic matter and nutrients from runoff during the pre-flood season acted as critical triggers for cyanobacterial blooms.

However, in socio-technical-environmental realities in continuous transition, wellbeing extends to areas that cannot be confined within the notions of comfort or healthiness because it involves material and immaterial, cultural and technical, aesthetic and performative, real and virtual aspects.Method: The aim of this article emerges from studies being conducted as part of Ex-Mind research. The working hypothesis is to broaden performance-based approaches in a technological-environmental sense to avoid reducing the goal of psycho-physical wellbeing just to the compliance with technical-constructive aspects. It could be possible combining the material and quantifiable dimensions with other aspects that extend the project to sensorial, perceptive, and emotional interactions. Important theoretical-scientific evidence is already emerging on this dichotomy to be overcome from areas of project evaluation responsive to the new paradigms of sustainability such as resilience, inclusive placemaking, and wellbeing according to the flourish model. Characteristics such as dimensions, proportions, shapes, colors, scents and immaterial aspects of spaces, for example, should be evaluated with respect to the complex physical and mental comfort conditions that they can produce.Results: In the technological-environmental vision of the human habitat project, the objective of psycho-physical wellbeing should be a function of the dynamic balance between the constantly evolving users'/inhabitants' needs and the variability of context factors and agents. The concept of wellbeing therefore takes on a scalar and expanded declination. Considering the technological-environmental approach, a possible element of originality emerges in the integrated and balanced human-environmental centered vision aimed at broadening the framework of the qualitative-quantitative references of the project of the human habitat. This could be an alternative bio-psycho-socio-technological methodological vision starting from the determinants of wellbeing in a broad sense, including natural, cultural and socioeconomic environmental factors, social and collective networks of relationships and participation, individual behavioral, physical, and functional factors of people. Added to these determinants are the different technological-environmental interface systems with which the project is able to define, in a bio-psycho-socio-technological sense, multiple and variable regulatory conditions of wellbeing, at a building, urban, and territorial level.Discussion: The possible outcomes of this alternative and integrated hypothesis are related to the reconnection with the production and regeneration processes of the built material, to the reorganization and reinvention of spatial and perceptual relationships between individuals, communities, technologies, environment, and to the integration of non-directly quantifiable subjective variables into the design of the built environment.The proposed integrated bio-psycho-socio-technological vision may open for developments concerning the expansion of the determinants of psycho-physical wellbeing through new performative descriptors and the definition of agile tools, procedures, and metrics to integrate wellbeing assessments, including consensus-based approaches.",technological culture of design,wellbeing,performance-based approach,architecture for 5 senses,,,FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT,materiality/immateriality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
