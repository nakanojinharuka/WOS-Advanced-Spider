W.",Synergies and trade-offs in achieving sustainable targets of urban renewal: A decision-making support framework,ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE,JUN 2024,2,"Urban renewal in high-density cities presents a complex challenge when it comes to balancing social-environmental performance and economic benefits; improvements to the built environment and social wellbeing may be associated with substantial costs and economic loss, and particularly so where land resources are scarce and highly valued. The interplay that takes place between sustainable targets tends to be very complicated. This study proposes a decision-making support framework that can quantify the synergies and trade-offs between economic, environmental, and social targets pertaining to land use change and public open space (OS) provision in urban renewal processes. The proposed decision-making support framework operates at both neighbourhood and building levels, and is comprised of three analytical components: a redevelopment trend analysis module, a three-dimensional land use simulation module, and a sustainable performance evaluation module. One high-density and ageing district in Hong Kong, Yau Mong district, was selected as the case study area for this work. Six planning scenarios were built which reflect various priorities and principles including economic benefits, environmental benefits, the equal distribution of OS provision and enhancing the quality of OS. The findings suggest that there is a trade-off relationship between economic-environmental targets, a synergic relationship between social-environmental targets, and a mediational relationship between economic-social targets. Planning strategies such as rezoning, land use reconfigurations, plot ratio adjustment and the transfer of development rights could be triangulated as strategic approaches by which to maximising the synergies and achieve better sustainability. The study not only contributes to theory by introducing a prototype of a comprehensive decision-making framework to evaluate sustainability performance, but also provides important insights into reconciling the divergent sustainable targets inherent in urban renewal.",3D land use model,urban renewal decision-making,public open space,trade-off,synergy,,,,,,,,

As rapid urbanization continues to be a global challenge, the economic impacts of different urban revitalization strategies hold crucial importance in informed urban planning and policymaking. This study uses a spatial hedonic approach to analyze the influence of distinct urban renewal and regeneration initiatives on land values. The results reveal that the urban renewal project, which involves significant physical upgrades and redevelopment, appears to substantially increase land prices. However, a deeper analysis accounting for spatial spillover effects indicates that most of this increase is due to the influence of high-value adjacent areas. Conversely, urban regeneration projects, which focus on enhancing the socioeconomic and cultural aspects of urban areas without causing drastic physical changes, consistently have a significant positive impact on land prices, even when spatial structures are considered. This study underscores that urban planners and policymakers should carefully evaluate the type of urban revitalization strategy to be implemented and its contextual spatial effects. The findings suggest that urban regeneration can be a more effective tool than urban renewal for sustainable urban improvement, contributing to enhanced land utility and neighborhood development. These insights are particularly valuable for cities in developed and developing countries facing similar urban challenges.",Urban revitalization,Urban renewal,Urban regeneration,Neighborhood development,Land prices,Hedonic pricing model,Spatial hedonic approach,,,,,,
Row_3,"Wang, Wen-Kai","Tsai, I. -Chun",,,,Discussing the role of urban renewal incentive policies based on housing price effects,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND POLICY,MAR 2025,0,"Although policies to reward urban renewal are essential, their effects are difficult to measure. This paper takes Taipei City's ""bulk reward policy"" as an example to illustrate that the effectiveness of this type of incentive policy can be measured by changes in housing premiums of the properties that meet the policy. The policy is a floor area ratio reward policy, which is adopted to encourage people to renovate their old and dilapidated houses, solving the problem of buildings and infrastructure wearing out. This paper uses a theoretical model of real options to illustrate the possible impact of this rewarding policy, which states that if the policy is effective, the buildings that meet the reward type will increase the housing price due to the increase in the probability of redevelopment. This paper uses 16,865 transaction samples from 2019 to 2020 to verify the effect of the incentive policy revised by the Taipei City Government on December 19, 2019. The empirical tests also provide evidence showing that the increase in rewards can indeed boost housing prices. Through the analysis of this study, we can quantitatively measure the effectiveness of reward urban renewal policies based on changes in housing prices of old houses to be renovated. It will not only show the market's response to policies, but also capitalize the effects of urban renewal policies, providing a way to compare the benefits of urban renewal policies with their costs using monetary values. Urban renewal policies often involve the interests of many people and are complex. This paper contributes to this topic by providing a method for evaluating policies from a financial perspective.",Urban renewal,Urban renewal incentive policies,The floor area ratio,Land redevelopment,Evaluating policies,,,,,,,,

Time-series urban land use (ULU) maps are vital for capturing dynamic land changes in the urbanization process, giving valuable insights into urban development and its environmental consequences. Recent studies have mapped ULU in some cities with a unified model, but ignored the regional differences among cities; and they generated ULU maps year by year, but ignored temporal correlations between years; thus, they could be weak in large-scale and long time-series ULU monitoring. Accordingly, we introduce an temporal-spatial-semantic collaborative (TSS) mapping framework to generating accurate ULU maps with considering regional differences and temporal correlations. Firstly, to support model training, a large-scale ULU sample dataset based on OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Sentinel-2 imagery is automatically constructed, providing a total number of 56,412 samples with a size of 512 x 512 which are divided into six sub-regions in China and used for training different classification models. Then, an urban land use mapping network (ULUNet) is proposed to recognize ULU. This model utilizes a primary and an auxiliary encoder to process noisy OSM samples and can enhance the model's robustness under noisy labels. Finally, taking the temporal correlations of ULU into consideration, the recognized ULU are optimized, whose boundaries are unified by a time-series co-segmentation, and whose categories are modified by a knowledge-data driven method. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we consider all urban areas in China (254,566 km2), and produce a time-series China urban land use dataset (CULU) at a 10-m resolution, spanning from 2016 to 2022, with an overall accuracy of CULU is 82.42%. Through comparison, it can be found that CULU outperforms existing datasets such as EULUC-China and UFZ-31cities in data accuracies, spatial boundaries consistencies and land use transitions logicality. The results indicate that the proposed method and generated dataset can play important roles in land use change monitoring, ecological-environmental evolution analysis, and also sustainable city development.",Urbanization,Land use,Time-series mapping,China urban land use dataset (CULU),,,,"Du, Shihong",,,,,

This helps reveal how urban form evolution impacts the thermal environment. Previous research often used isolated images, ignoring the temporal dimension of thermal infrared and reflectance data from Landsat sensors. Additionally, cost-effective and efficient methods for reconstructing time-series built height are lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, we utilized Landsat time-series data to reconstruct the yearly trends in urban form in Beijing, China, spanning from 1990 to 2020. Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) time series analysis method was used to identify urban growth and renewal years. Employing a reference height for 2020 and logical reasoning method, we reconstructed the annual dynamics of built-up heights, pinpointing years of significant change. Finally, we analyzed the alterations in urban form over the past three decades and their impact on surface temperature changes. Our change detection method achieved an overall accuracy of 86 %, demonstrating its effectiveness in determining the year of change. When compared with data from Lianjia and LiDAR point cloud, our height reconstruction method showed impressive accuracy, with R-2 values of 0.9773 and 0.9526, respectively. Analysis of summer and winter LST values revealed distinct temperature patterns across different building heights, with mid-rise buildings exhibiting the highest LST in summer and low-rise buildings registering the highest LST in winter. During periods of urban growth, both mean and amplitude values of LST increased, while during urban renewal (demolition), they decreased. The date of annual temperature peaks advanced during urban growth but delayed during urban renewal (demolition). Our time series analysis framework offers a new method for understanding the yearly dynamics of urban form and its influence on surface temperature, with potential applications in carbon emission and urban climate modeling studies.",Urban growth,Urban renewal,Height dynamics,Time-series surface temperature,Temporal thermal signature,,,,,,,,

A planned unit development (PUD) is a land -use planning instrument that is often used to improve urban quality in urban renewal and densification worldwide. In this study, we analyse the influence of PUDs on urban vegetation in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland, by contrasting them with conventional zoning. We modelled the share of shrub and tree canopy cover per neighbourhood block using generalized linear mixed effect models (GLMM), with the type of planning instrument as the focal predictor amongst other control variables known from the literature to be influential on urban vegetation. Results show that PUDs are associated with significantly less urban vegetation cover than conventional zoning. This is unexpected and raises concerns. Given how important PUDs are as levers for improving urban quality, their observed inability to promote valuable shrub and tree structures leads us to recommend that good landscape planning and long-term management of (existing and new) urban vegetation be included as an additional standard criterion of high priority in the assessment of future PUDs.",Urban forestry,Zoning,Planned unit development (PUD),Density,Generalized linear effects model (GLMM),,,,,,,,

To characterize urban development at an accurate spatiotemporal scale, a change detection model is not only required to provide accurate location (Where) and time (When) of the changes, but also semantic information on the change types (What). Accordingly, this study proposed a deep learning method for temporal semantic segmentation change detection (TSSCD) that obtains information on the where, when, and what of changes simultaneously. TSSCD model bridges the semantic gap between remote sensing time series abrupt changes and land cover changes by learning the month-to-month mapping from spectral information to land cover types. We implemented a temporal semantic segmentation model based on the most classic fully convolutional network, where all two-dimensional convolutions and pooling operations were replaced with one-dimensional. We conducted tests on the TSSCD in several urban study areas, and it consistently exhibited good accuracy. In most cases, it outperformed the BFAST and CCDC algorithms, except when only a single spectral band was used. Simultaneously, we analyzed the minimum data requirements for training a TSSCD. The TSSCD currently faces challenges in achieving strong generalization beyond the training data distribution. Additionally, we observed that change detection for specific land cover types can be achieved through the flexible configuration of TSSCD. Finally, we explored a method for constructing datasets using existing products to minimize data annotation efforts, yielding promising results. However, there is still some gap compared to complete manual annotation. Overall, the TSSCD model provided a novel solution to accurately characterize sustainable urban development at the spatiotemporal scale.",TSSCD,Change detection,Remote sensing,Urban expansion and renewal,Sentinel-2 time series,Deep learning,,"Wang, Lizhe",,,,,

Urbanization that takes place without taking into account these legal and technical bases lead to the emergence of informal, risky and dysfunctional settlements. Over time, these settlements become increasingly vulnerable due to their failure to meet social and technical requirements, making their sustainability increasingly challenging, and inevitably becoming subjects of urban renewal activities. Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform's archive of satellite images provides temporal monitoring of urbanization on Earth for about 50 years and analysis of changes in the cloud environment. This study investigates whether the GEE platform can use to detect the impact of the areas where settlement activities are carried out without a development plan in the current urban transformation projects in Istanbul. Land use/cover maps classified with the Random Forest algorithm correlate urbanization activities in urban renewal areas with the entry into force date of the spatial plans that guide the settlement. The classification results evaluated in conjunction with statistical tests and spatial plan decisions demonstrate that unplanned urbanization is a serious obstacle to the sustainability of settlements. Additionally, the study results show the performance of the GEE platform in detecting the effects of factors in the urbanization period. The GEE platform can serve as a facilitative tool for deriving lessons from urbanization experiences to inform policymaking.",Urban renewal,Development plans,Informal settlements,Urbanization policies,Google Earth Engine (GEE),,,,,,,,

Revealing the driving mechanism of land use/cover change (LUCC) and simulating the land use pattern can help to coordinate the land use conflicts in the future. Utilizing the National Land Survey Data (NLSD) of Jiangling County in Jianghan Plain (2011-2020) and the patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model, this paper analyzed the characteristics of land use evolution, applied the random forest classification (RFC) to analyze the driving mechanism, simulated the 2035 land use pattern under three scenarios of natural development, planning guidance and ecological protection through Markov and Cellular Automaton based on multiple random seeds (CARS) models, and proposed several countermeasures. The study found that: 1) From 2011 to 2020, town construction land increased, village construction land, agricultural land and ecological land decreased. 2) The factors driving LUCC were socio-economic factors, spatial factors, and natural factors in descending order. 3) In the three scenarios, the trend of construction land expansion, agricultural land and ecological land encroachment is inevitable by 2035. 4) It is imperative to actively advocate for large-scale mechanization and informatization of agricultural production, encourage the repurposing of idle and inefficiently used construction land, facilitate multi-purpose land utilization, and implement a policy of locally balancing occupation and compensation for cultivated and ecological land. 5) When employing the PLUS model to simulate LUCC, using continuous NLSD yielded more accurate results than remote sensing image interpretation data.

The potential drivers of LST evolution were detected with random forest algorithm. We found that the thermal environment in the YRD had undergone deterioration trends, with the fastest warming trend observed in urban new towns (2.30 degrees C/decade). Although the urban cores had the highest LST, 15.91 % of urban cores exhibited a cooling trend, especially in cities with higher urbanization levels, which was caused by restored vegetation through urban renewal. Population density had the highest positive contributions in urban cores (21.08 %), while anthropogenic heat emissions accounted 21.87 % of the warming trend in urban new towns.

Thus, understanding the drivers of changes in settlement patterns is essential. In this article, we present a spatially explicit, geostatistical analysis of settlement dynamics, and a qualitative investigation of its regulative, demographic, and economic drivers, using the example of Vienna, Austria between 1984 and 2018. Combining spatially explicit metrics of urban sprawl and cluster analysis, we analyzed highresolution maps of buildings, population, and jobs to identify distinct settlement trajectories. Societal drivers of more or less sprawled settlement dynamics are analyzed with desk research and expert interviews. We distinguish five types of settlement dynamics: persistently dense areas with increasing use intensity, redensification of dense areas, persistently sprawled areas, redensification of sprawled areas, and persistently isolated buildings. Urban renewal schemes have fostered the re-densification of dense areas in response to population growth and urban economic restructuring. The combination of urban renewal schemes and green space policies has successfully limited urban expansion. Challenges arise from the demand for single-family housing and corresponding zoning regulations.

However, limited attention has been paid to detecting these mismatched commuting patterns and their associations with built environmental characteristics. To maximize the effectiveness of urban facility allocation and improve commuting efficiency, this paper developed a framework to identify anomalous commuting interaction patterns. A weighted bipartite network considering urban land attractiveness was first constructed to analyze the commuting flows between urban units. Then a modified Hungarian algorithm was proposed to obtain the optimal commuting interaction fluxes. By comparing real and optimal interaction fluxes, two types of commuting anomalies were detected. Finally, the machine learning model was used to explore the non-linear relationships between built environment and anomalous commuting patterns. Results show the spatial distribution of areas with significant anomalous interactions and the difference between overload- and underload- related anomalous commuting patterns.

Using the average of these thresholds, the low backscattering regions are extracted to generate a preliminary inundation map. Then, the neighborhood-based change detection method combined with entropy thresholding is adopted to detect the changed areas.

Using LST inversion and resampling methods, LST data for different grid sizes were obtained for spring, summer, and winter in the 2010s, 2015s, and 2020 s. A boosting regression tree model was employed to determine the key indicators affecting LST and effective cooling thresholds. The impact of green quality, structure, and pattern at the community scale on LST was discussed, providing feasible suggestions for green space planning and design in different urban spaces. The study found significant differences in the spatial patterns of green areas and LST among the three sample regions. The quantity and integrity of green spaces in the Huangpu, Minhang, and Songjiang sample areas have progressively improved, with overall green coverages of 19 %, 38 %, and 43 %, respectively. As grid size increases, the relative influence of fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) on LST generally decreases, whereas the relative influence of green structure and patterns gradually increases. Taking the summer of the 2020 s as an example, the influence of FVC on the three study sample areas was 80.79, 83.36, and 87.18 at a 30 m grid size, which decreased to 48.87, 40.59, and 47.64 at a 120 m grid size. The green structure's impact rose from 13.09, 15.22, and 10.6-30.01, 51.82, and 38.5; the influence of green patterns increased from 6.12, 1.42, and 2.21-21.13, 7.6, and 13.86. Key indicators affecting LST include FVC (Fractional Vegetation Coverage), AREA (Green Patch Area), PD (Patch Density), COHESION (Patch Cohesion Index), and ED (Edge Density). High temperatures in summer are one of the ecological issues that need special attention in Shanghai's green space design. Setting the green space proportion to 35 % while avoiding fragmentation and low vegetation coverage can achieve effective cooling. This study's main advancement lies in utilizing machine learning algorithms to identify the principal green spatial pattern impact factors and key thresholds influencing LST at the community scale in Shanghai. The related results and proposed strategies provide a research framework and strong basis for special regulations in urban green space system planning concerning urban thermal environments. They offer references for urban renewal and new town planning to address climate change and urban high-temperature issues, such as clear requirements for optimal green space area at the community scale, community park spatial layout and quantity regulations, and urban park planning design suggestions. This study also highlights obstacles in the practical application of planning and design strategies, which can help avoid difficulties in implementing planning policies. It attempts to set goals for community-scale vegetation planning in China from a policy perspective and provides relevant recommendations.",Surface temperature,Scale effect,High-density city,Machine learning,Green space system planning,,,"Che, Shengquan",,,,,

Referring to the theory of planned behavior (TPB), combined with the characteristics of regeneration decision-making, the external environmental factors affecting residents' participation in such decision-making activities, through impacting psychological environmental factors, were determined by establishing the structural equation model (SEM) and conducting a survey. The guidance measures of enhancing external pressure and providing regeneration information were selected. Participation guidance experiments were designed, and the typical communities located in the development zone and city center of Harbin, China were selected as the experiment regions. Forty-eight subjects were screened in each experimental region and divided into six groups; three participated in the experiments regarding the leading role of representatives, enhancing communication, and incentives, and three in the experiments on policy advocacy, regeneration technology popularization, and regeneration case sharing. Guidance measures' effects for introversion or extraversion, regardless of region are, from large to small, incentives, regeneration case sharing, leading role of representatives, enhancing communication, policy advocacy and regeneration technology popularization. There are significant differences in the effects of enhancing external pressure measures between different personalities, and enhancing external pressure measures are more effective for extraversion. Although the differences in the effects of providing regeneration information measures are statistically insignificant, providing such measures is more effective for introversion. The results reflect the analysis of the influencing factors. TPB application is enriched and the guidance experiments used to verify guiding measures' effectiveness are provided. Practically-significant implications include: communities and proprietor committees should organize neighborhood-relationship to enhance community activities, with the proprietor committee solving residents' daily problems to win authority and trust, positively guiding residents' participation. Community staff can also understand, via daily participation, residents' personality traits, so as to implement the above-mentioned guidance measures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
