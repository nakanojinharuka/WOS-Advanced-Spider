Row_229,"Xu, Pengpeng","Huang, Helai",Modeling crash spatial heterogeneity: Random parameter versus geographically weighting,ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION,FEB 2015,204,"The widely adopted techniques for regional crash modeling include the negative binomial model (NB) and Bayesian negative binomial model with conditional autoregressive prior (CAR). The outputs from both models consist of a set of fixed global parameter estimates. However, the impacts of predicting variables on crash counts might not be stationary over space. This study intended to quantitatively investigate this spatial heterogeneity in regional safety modeling using two advanced approaches, i.e., random parameter negative binomial model (RPNB) and semi-parametric geographically weighted Poisson regression model (S-GWPR).Based on a 3-year data set from the county of Hillsborough, Florida, results revealed that (1) both RPNB and S-GWPR successfully capture the spatially varying relationship, but the two methods yield notably different sets of results; (2) the S-GWPR performs best with the highest value of id as well as the lowest mean absolute deviance and Akaike information criterion measures. Whereas the RPNB is comparable to the CAR, in some cases, it provides less accurate predictions; (3) a moderately significant spatial correlation is found in the residuals of RPNB and NB, implying the inadequacy in accounting for the spatial correlation existed across adjacent zones.As crash data are typically collected with reference to location dimension, it is desirable to firstly make use of the geographical component to explore explicitly spatial aspects of the crash data (i.e., the spatial heterogeneity, or the spatially structured varying relationships), then is the unobserved heterogeneity by non-spatial or fuzzy techniques. The S-GWPR is proven to be more appropriate for regional crash modeling as the method outperforms the global models in capturing the spatial heterogeneity occurring in the relationship that is model, and compared with the non-spatial model, it is capable of accounting for the spatial correlation in crash data.

Symbiotic bacteria that oxidize dissolved sulfur, methane, and hydrogen gases nourish bathymodiolin mussels that thrive in these environments worldwide. The mussel symbionts are newly acquired in each generation via infection by free-living forms. This study examined geographical subdivision of the thiotrophic endosymbionts hosted by Bathymodiolus mussels living along the eastern Pacific hydrothermal vents. High-throughput sequencing data of 16S ribosomal RNA encoding gene and fragments of six protein-coding genes of symbionts were examined in the samples collected from nine vent localities at the East Pacific Rise, Galapagos Rift, and Pacific-Antarctic Ridge.Results: Both of the parapatric sister-species, B. thermophilus and B. antarcticus, hosted the same numerically dominant phylotype of thiotrophic Gammaproteobacteria. However, sequences from six protein-coding genes revealed highly divergent symbiont lineages living north and south of the Easter Microplate and hosted by these two Bathymodiolus mussel species. High heterogeneity of symbiont haplotypes among host individuals sampled from the same location suggested that stochasticity associated with initial infections was amplified as symbionts proliferated within the host individuals. The mussel species presently contact one another and hybridize along the Easter Microplate, but the northern and southern symbionts appear to be completely isolated. Vicariance associated with orogeny of the Easter Microplate region, 2.5-5.3 million years ago, may have initiated isolation of the symbiont and host populations. Estimates of synonymous substitution rates for the protein-coding bacterial genes examined in this study were 0.77-1.62%/nucleotide/million years.Conclusions: Our present study reports the most comprehensive population genetic analyses of the chemosynthetic endosymbiotic bacteria based on high-throughput genetic data and extensive geographical sampling to date, and demonstrates the role of the geographical features, the Easter Microplate and geographical distance, in the intraspecific divergence of this bacterial species along the mid-ocean ridge axes in the eastern Pacific.

""Aging before getting rich"", a notion in population and economic development, has been a serious threat to sustainable development in China. On the basis of town- and street block-scale data from the Fifth and Sixth National Census in the Yangtze River Delta, we studied spatial distribution characteristics of population aging using global Moran's I and hotspot analysis, and applied the geographical detector technique to explain the spatial heterogeneity of population aging. Several conclusions were drawn. (1) The promotion and replacement of aging coexist. Cluster of aging degree exhibits an increasing trend. Population aging is more severe in suburban areas than urban areas. (2) Migration is the main factor affecting the spatial heterogeneity of population aging. Per capital GDP and road network density are the second most influential factors. By contrast, the relief degree of land surface and the air quality index minimally influence population aging. The mechanisms of aging in various regions are affected by varying development levels. (3) The interaction among social, economic, and environmental factors enhances their effects and, thus, interacting factors have a greater influence on population aging than any single factor.

However, previous studies on ECEs that focus on both the global-regional scale and the interaction of factors have been seldom conducted. In this paper, ECE data from 143 countries from 1990 to 2014 were selected to analyze regional differences in ECE growth rates by using the coefficient of variation. Then a geographical detector was used to analyze the key determinant factors on ECE growth rates around the world and in eight types of regions. The results show that: (1) the ECE growth rate in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) region is low and tended to decrease, while in the non-OECD region it is high and tended to increase; (2) the coefficient of variation and detection factor of ECE growth rates at a regional scale are higher than those at a global scale; (3) in terms of the key determinant factors, population growth rate, growth rate of per capita GDP, and energy intensity growth rate are the three key determinant factors of ECE growth rates in the OECD region and most of the non-OECD regions such as non-OECD European and Eurasian (NO-EE), Asia (NO-AS), non-OECD Americas (NO-AM). The key determinant factors in the African (NO-AF) region are population growth rates and natural gas carbon intensity growth rates. The key determinant factors of the Middle East (NO-ME) are population growth rate, coal carbon intensity growth rate and per capita GDP growth rate; (4) the determinant power of the detection factor, the population growth rate at the global scale and regional scale is the strongest, showing a significant spatial consistency. The determinant power of per capita GDP growth rate and energy intensity growth rate in the OECD region, respectively, rank second and third, also showing a spatial consistency. However, the carbon intensity growth rates of the three fossil fuels contribute little to the growth rate of ECEs, and their spatial coherence is weak; (5) from the perspective of the interaction of detection factors, six detection factors showed bilinear or non-linear enhancement at a global and a regional scale, and the determinant power of the interaction of factors was significantly enhanced; and (6) from the perspective of ecological detection, the growth rate of carbon intensity and the growth rate of natural gas carbon intensity at the global scale and NO-ME region are significantly stronger than other factors, with a significant difference in the spatial distribution of its incidence. Therefore, the OECD region should continue to reduce the growth of energy intensity, and develop alternative energy resources in the future, while those that are plagued by carbon emissions in non-OECD regions should pay more attention to the positive influence of lower population growth rates on reducing the growth rate of energy-related CO2 emissions.

In India, it is highly prevalent but with varied distribution in various geographical areas resulting in substantial economic losses to farmers. The discrepancy in prevalence estimates across studies needs to be evaluated in order to strengthen the prevention and control strategies of CSF in pigs. The aim of the present study was to provide the pooled estimate of the prevalence of classical swine fever (CSF) in India and to examine the consistency of those estimates between published studies.Methods: The data regarding prevalence of CSF in 7045 pigs were compiled from 22 published studies using comprehensive literature search for period from 1998 to 2018. The pooled prevalence of CSF was obtained under random effects model and heterogeneity between studies was determined using I-2 Index. Representation of meta-analysis was done using forest plot and followed by funnel plot, Baujat plot and radial plot.Result: The result of Meta-analysis revealed that pooled estimate of prevalence of CSF under random effects model was 45% (95% confidence interval: 35, 55%) in India. The heterogeneity statistic (Q) was found to be significant (p<0.001) with I2=98% which indicated that prevalence of CSF was inconsistent between the studies.

Exploring geographical heterogeneity across Germany 2007-2017,DEMOGRAPHIC RESEARCH,APR 7 2022,6,"BACKGROUND Public childcare provision and female labor force participation (FLP) have strongly increased over the past decades in European societies. However, studies offer heterogeneous findings on the link between public childcare and FLP. OBJECTIVE We investigate the link between public childcare and FLP, using different indicators of childcare and accounting for heterogeneous time trends and regional heterogeneity. METHODS Based on a balanced panel of all German counties from 2007 to 2017, we estimate the effect of an increasing enrollment rate for children aged 0-2 and 3-5 on FLP. We compare fixed effect (FE) and fixed effect individual slope estimators (FEIS) to control for county-specific time trends. Subsequently, we compare the results across regions with different levels of urbanization. RESULTS We find that most FE results are biased due to selection on trends. Still, when accounting for selection on trends, childcare enrollment for the age group 0-2 increases FLP in West Germany and in urban areas. Furthermore, childcare enrollment for children aged 3-5 years is associated with higher FLP in West Germany, in rural and, most strongly, in metropolitan areas. CONCLUSIONS Our study highlights important heterogeneity in the general time trends of FLP and the effectiveness of childcare arrangements across different regions in Germany. CONTRIBUTION We provide a potential explanation for mixed results in previous studies. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that the effectiveness of childcare arrangements varies with the level of urbanization.

We used data from the China Air Pollution and Health Effects Study (CAPES), which demonstrated a geographical heterogeneity of the acute effect of particulate air pollution (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10 gm, or PM10) on mortality in 16 Chinese cities. Given that a large fraction of the exposure to PM10 of outdoor origin occurs indoors, we made the hypothesis that this heterogeneity might be partially explained by inter-city differences in indoor exposure to PM10 of outdoor origin. In our analysis, we estimated PM10 exposure coefficients (the change in the estimated personal exposure to PM10 of outdoor origin per unit change in outdoor PM10 concentration) in these 16 Chinese cities and examined their correlation with PM10 mortality coefficients (the increase in mortality associated with a given increase in the concentrations of outdoor PM10). We showed that the PM10 mortality coefficients and the PM10 exposure coefficients were significantly correlated, with an R-squared (R-2) value of 0.549 (95% confidence interval: 0.201, 0.771; p < 0.01) for the 16 cities. The correlation was robust with different values of the key input parameters, and close in value to estimations found in previous studies on similar subjects. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, we aimed to synthesize the global knowledge about the relationship between spatial EH and freshwater biodiversity (i.e. taxonomic and functional diversity, and their respective alpha and beta components). Through a systematic review, we integrated results from 98 studies, published in 33 different countries, about the role of spatial EH - biodiversity relationship in freshwater ecosystems. Through meta-analysis, we demonstrated that spatial EH has a positive effect over taxonomic and functional alpha diversity. Besides, we confirmed that the positive effect of spatial EH over taxonomic alpha diversity is consistent across geographical locations, ecosystem types, taxonomic groups, occurrence zones and between experiments with different methodological designs. Nonetheless, there was not enough evidence to robustly estimate the overall effect of spatial EH over taxonomic and functional beta diversity.

A wide variation ranging from 6th April to 8th May was observed among 404 accessions, and inter-and intra-population variations were also detected. Correlation analysis with eco-geographical variables clearly showed that early heading types are adapted to warmer and drier conditions, while late heading types are adapted to cooler and more humid conditions. Especially for the inland populations, about 2/3 of the inter-population variation could be explained by five eco-geographical variables, that is, altitude, temperature, rainfall, humidity, and evaporation. Intra-population variation was also largely affected by temperature and water conditions. In contrast to the relatively uniform populations in the western area, the variation was larger in the southeastern area where wild emmer wheat grows under severe aridity stress. Considering that vernalization response and narrow-sense earliness were related to heading date in wild emmer wheat, the variation of these traits was essential for the adaptation to macro-and microgeographical heterogeneities or instability of growing conditions.

Often the spatial heterogeneity of an area is handled by referring to a case-control design, in which spatial clusters occur as over-concentrations of firms belonging to a specific industry as opposed to the distribution of firms in the whole economy. Therefore, positive, or negative, spatial dependence between firms occurs when a specific sector of industry is seen to present a more aggregated pattern (or more dispersed) than is common in the economy as a whole. This approach has led to the development of relative measures of spatial concentration which, as a consequence, are not straightforwardly comparable across different economies. In this article, we explore a parametric approach based on the inhomogeneous K-function (Baddeley et al. in Statistica Nederlandica 54(3):329-350, 2000) that makes it possible to obtain an absolute measure of the industrial agglomeration that is also able to capture spatial heterogeneity.

The spatial heterogeneity of ET patterns poses a great challenge for regional ET estimation over heterogeneous landscapes. In this study, we proposed a framework for estimating ET through interactive detector for spatial associations (IDSA)-based machine learning (ML) approaches by combining data from remote sensing and four flux towers distributed in the Hai River Basin. The IDSA model was applied to explore individual and interactive determinants of ET over the Hai River Basin. In addition, the geographical regions of ET were determined according to the spatial heterogeneity. Then we simulated ET in each geographical region separately using three ML models, including random forest, gradient boosting decision tree, and Cubist. General ML models without considering spatial heterogeneity were used for comparison, and evaluations were conducted with the eddy covariance flux tower observations at the site scale, also with water balance ET at the basin scale. The results demonstrated that the spatial patterns of ET were difficult to be explained by individual environmental variables (64.9 %). The maximum interpretability was improved by about 11.2 % through the interaction of air temperature (T) and normalized different vegetation index (NDVI). The framework developed in this study had excellent performance with coefficient of determination (R2) ranging from 0.807 to 0.811, root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 0.654 mm/day to 0.661 mm/day, and mean absolute error (MAE) ranging from 0.470 mm/day to 0.485 mm/day. It was superior to general ML models at the site and basin scales. Additionally, the ET simulated by IDSA-based ML models were in good agreement with the reference product, further illustrating its reliability.

However, as Glaeser, Ponzetto, and Tobio highlighted, these laws are reliable for long-term dynamics; but in some moments or for some places, the balance between the different factors may change, giving rise to different specific behaviors. In this article, we study local population growth in Spain with no intention of searching for universal patterns. Rather, we are interested in identifying how relevant the temporal and spatial heterogeneity may be, that is, to assess the even and uneven effects that population growth determinants can exert across time and space. The geographically weighted regression (GWR) approach applied in this article for two different decades, 1991-2001 and 2001-2011, captures the spatial heterogeneity. Results on the spatially differentiated population growth factors are compared with the global ordinary least squares (OLS) estimators for both decades. Essential factors in urban and regional economics such as size (initial population) or distance (either to the big cities or to the coast) can have different effects on population growth across both space and time, corresponding to the global estimated effects for some areas but diverging from these in others. Using GWR estimation procedures, we can identify changes in the sign or in the intensity of a factor's effect across space, such that some factors could enhance population growth in one place but reduce it in another.

Instead of a logarithmic relationship with pixel size observed in the corresponding aggregated images, the spatial variability decayed and the spatial structures decomposed more slowly and complexly with spatial resolution for real multisensor images. As the spatial resolution increased, the proportion of spatial variability of the smaller spatial structure decreased quickly and only a larger spatial structure was observed at very coarse scales. Compared with visible band, greater spatial variability was observed in near infrared band for both densely and less densely vegetated landscapes. The influence of image size on spatial heterogeneity was highly dependent on whether the empirical semivariogram reached its sill within the original image size. When the empirical semivariogram did not reach its sill at the original observation scale, spatial variability and mean characteristic length scale would increase with image size; otherwise they might decrease.

While the composition of the living environment thus often seems to matter, when and where remain unclear. We contribute to the literature by: (1) scrutinizing the extent to which ethnic heterogeneity drives down trust in coethnic neighbours, non-coethnic neighbours, unknown neighbours and unknown non-neighbours similarly; (2) comparing effects of heterogeneity aggregated to geographical areas that vary in scale and type of boundary; and (3) assessing whether the impact of heterogeneity of the local area depends on the wider geographic context.

Our dependent variables are four different so-called wallet-items, which we model through spatial and multilevel regression techniques. We demonstrate that both trust in non-coethnic and coethnic neighbours are lower in heterogeneous environments. Trust in people outside the neighbourhood is not affected by local heterogeneity.

Open space fragmentation is the transformation of open space from a state of homogeneity, integration, and continuity to a state of heterogeneity, division, and incoherence. Nevertheless, one main obstacle to understanding this issue is how to address the spatial heterogeneity of the impact of urbanisation on open space fragmentation. Thus, this paper provides a comprehensive framework for the mechanistic associations between open space fragmentation and urbanisation in Hong Kong's built-up area. The results illustrate that both open space fragmentation index and urbanisation index values are noticeably higher in dense urban areas. Land urbanisation, represented by the percentage of construction land in total land, has the highest explanatory power for spatial differentiation in open space fragmentation, followed by social and population urbanisation factors. Furthermore, the relational interrelations of open space fragmentation drivers are the bivariate and nonlinear enhancement interactions. Social urbanisation and land urbanisation have the strongest bivariate enhancement interaction for the use fragmentation form and the largest nonlinear enhancement interaction for the internal fragmentation form. Based on initial urban planning, open space fragmentation is an adaptation outcome of population, land, and social urbanisation factors, and this self-organisation phenomenon has been further emphasised in the historical process. These insights significantly enrich our understanding of how urbanisation affects open space fragmentation and provide valuable guidance for better open space strategies.",open space fragmentation,urbanisation,spatial heterogeneity,geographical detector,open space planning,"Han, Mingqing","Yung, Esther H.

Nevertheless, quantifying the aggregation scale of flows is still an unsolved problem. In this paper, we propose the L-function for flows as a solution, derive theoretical null models of the K-function and L-function in a flow space. We conduct simulation experiments to validate the L-function and its capability to detect aggregation scales. Finally, we apply the solution in a case study with taxi data in Beijing and identify nine aggregation scales of taxi OD flows, ranging from 170 m to 22.1 km. These scales correspond to three classes: less than 300 m, from 600 m to 700 m and more than 1500 m. The classes are related to the sizes of the urban facilities where the dominant flow clusters occur, indicating that the L-function in flow space can detect the aggregation scale of flows at the building scale, the block scale and the district scale.",Flow space,aggregation scale,Ripley's L-function,origin-destination flow,spatial statistics,"Song, Ci","Chen, Xiao","Guo, Sihui","Liu, Yaxi","Chen, Jie","Wang, Xi",,"Zhou, Chenghu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study examines the effect of environmental heterogeneity of the Hyrcanian forests on populations of Circaea lutetiana L. (Onagraceae). Using morphometrics, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of leaf epidermis, and molecular markers, we analyzed genetic diversity and differentiation among nine populations from environmentally divergent habitats. Three different gene pools were observed. Our results indicate that the genetic structure is significantly correlated to environmental factors, but not to the geographical distance. Genetic clustering in C. lutetiana is affected by temperature, humidity, elevation, and average annual rainfall. Overall, our data indicate that gene flow does not contribute to explaining spatial patterns of genetic structure and the adaptation to the environment is the main factor shaping the genetic structure of the C. lutetiana populations. The populations belonging to each of the three gene pools have similarities in microclimate parameters, despite their geographical proximity, and populations from the same genetic pool can be up to 470 km apart. This evidence, as well as morphological and genetic similarities of the populations with greater geographical distance, suggest the possibility of cryptic speciation in this species.",Circaea lutetiana,environmental heterogeneity,gene flow,genetic diversity,Hyrcanian forests,"Naghiloo, Somayeh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To this end, this paper proposes a new LSM method that takes into account spatial heterogeneity and factor optimization. Firstly, a method based on frequency ratio, coupled with buffer-controlled sampling, is developed to extract non-landslides from the non-landslide area. Then, the study site is divided into several homogeneous areas using agglomerative clustering based on LIFs and spatial locations. Next, the LIFs are optimized in each region based on a combination of variance inflation factor, the Boruta algorithm, and geographical detector so as to avoid information redundancy and noise from both statistical and spatial perspectives. Finally, the random forest (RF) model with the optimized LIFs is used for LSM at the regional scale. Taking 686 landslides and 15 LIFs in Yibin city, China as an example, the proposed method was compared with four state-of-the-art models for LSM including regional RF, global RF with factor optimization, global RF using clustering attribute as one of its inputs, global RF without factor optimization, and global RF using a combination of factor optimization and clustering attribute. Results indicate that compared to the four classical models, the proposed method increases the Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1 score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve by 1.6-5.2%, 2.9-12.5%, 0.1-3.5%, 2.9-7.0%, and 1.8-4.7%, respectively. Additionally, the proposed method can produce more accurate and reasonable landslide susceptibility maps, with an increase in the disaster activity intensity index by 2.7-20.8%.

Considering the difference in topography and neglected landslide events, particularly in transboundary areas of the Himalayas, it is necessary to precisely model the susceptibility in relation to spatial heterogeneity. In this study, we have used multisource remote sensing data, open-source geographical data, and multisource landslide event inventories for the past 20 years (2000-2020). In addition, machine learning methods were implemented to establish a landslide susceptibility model with internal landslide drivers within the transboundary areas. Considering the spatial heterogeneity, the landslide susceptibility of the northern and southern slope in the transboundary areas of the Himalayas was determined using Google Earth Engine (GEE), an online cloud platform. Furthermore, we generated a thematic map of landslide susceptibility at a spatial resolution of 500 m, considering the contribution rate of each landslide internal driver of the landslide. Finally, we analyzed the landslide drivers in areas with high landslide susceptibility and low landslide event point density. The main results are as follows: (i) elevation, aspect, and fractional vegetation cover (FVC) are top three internal drivers of susceptibility on the northern and southern slopes. Meanwhile, the northern slope is dominated by geological, seismic, and soil structure parameters while the southern slope is dominated by terrain, geomorphological, and land cover parameters; (ii) elevation, aspect, and FVC of 3400-4100 m, 260 degrees -335 degrees, and 8 %-30 %, respectively, are related to high landslide susceptibility on the northern slope, while elevation, aspect, and FVC of 980-2100 m, 170 degrees -230 degrees, 70 %-98 %, respectively, are related to high landslide susceptibility on the southern slope, which presents more extreme landslide-susceptible areas compared with the northern slope; and (iii) areas with high landslide susceptibility and low landslide event density are universal. These insights demonstrate that modeling and analyzing the heterogeneity of landslide susceptibility of the northern and southern slopes in transboundary areas of the Himalayas are required to provide a reference for locating and preventing landslide disasters, increase to the focus on landslide-susceptible areas, improve the data gap between landslide inventories and actual landslide events, and reduce the impact of missing data in landslide inventories for this region.",Landslide susceptibility,Spatial heterogeneity,Himalayas,Transboundary,Machine learning,"Scaioni, Marco","Fu, Jing","Guo, Xin","Gao, Jun",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In fact, divergence among ITS2 variants within single mosquitoes from the Brazilian localities was often as great as that between localities. Similarly, the number of variants per mosquito was significantly greater in Brazil (maximum of six variants) than in both SO and SI (maximum of two variants). These results indicate that homogenization of ITS2 has proceeded to a greater extent in SO and SI than in the localities in Brazil.

Identifying the ecological and socioeconomic driving factors of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the relationships and bundles among multiple ESs is essential for effective agropastoral ecotone management and restoration. Herein, five key ESs, including water yield (WY), carbon sequestration (CS), sand fixation (SF), soil conservation (SC), and food production (FP), in the northern piedmont of the Yinshan Mountains (NPYM), a typical agropastoral ecotone, were quantified from 1990 to 2018. Ecosystem service bundles (ESBs) were identified by the Kmeans algorithm, and the trade-offs/synergies among the different ESs in each ESB were investigated using Spearman's correlation analysis. Moreover, the main driving factors of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the ES relationships and ESBs were identified by the geographical detector model. Our results showed that the five ESs in the NPYM exhibited high spatiotemporal heterogeneity over the last three decades, with WY, SC and FP significantly improving over time but CS and SF slightly decreasing. Considering the ecological features and spatial distribution, the NPYM could be divided into four ESBs: the grassland protection bundle (GPB), desertification control bundle (DCB), agricultural production bundle (APB) and forest conservation bundle (FCB). Although trade-offs between WY and CS and synergy between SC and CS occurred in almost all ESBs, significant differences in the relationships between the other ESs were observed in the different ESBs. Generally, land use type was one of the dominant drivers of most ES relationships in all ESBs, especially in the APB. However, climate, vegetation and socioeconomic factors also played important roles in the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of various ES relationships in some bundles. Moreover, the substantial changes in the different ESBs over the last three decades were mainly due to climatic and socioeconomic factors.

The spatial autocorrelation results showed that the spatial relationships between vegetation greening and browning were dominated by spatial heterogeneity (i.e., high greening and low browning, H-L clusters accounting for 60% and low greening and high browning, L-H clusters accounting for 14%), but we also revealed that there were still quite a few places (4%) with spatial dependence (i.e., high greening and browning, H-H clusters), occurring around urban areas and along roads. The factor detector indicated that the nighttime light intensity was among the most dominant factor of vegetation changes, followed by elevation and slope. Although the individual effect of the distance to roads was relatively weak on the vegetation changes, its indirect effect was found to be the strongest by the interaction detector, which was obtained from the interactions much larger than its independent impact. Simultaneously, the risk detector revealed that the greening preferred occurring in places with lower nighttime light intensity (<1.1 nW cm(-2)sr(-1)), higher elevation (>43.4 m) and slope (>6.3 degrees). Moreover, we found that the vegetation changes primarily occurred within a distance of 1685.4 m from roads. Our findings could deepen the understanding of vegetation change patterns and provide advice for mitigating the impact on the vegetation changes.",normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI),greening and browning,bivariate spatial autocorrelation,geographical detector,spatial dependence,"Lin, Sen","Wu, Zhilong","Qiu, Rongzu","Hu, Xisheng",,,spatial heterogeneity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on a survey of rural households in Qingyuan County located in the northeast forest zone in China, where is famous for GI product - Chinese Gentian (a Chinese herbal medicine), the efficiency enhancement mechanism of two groups of farmers (cooperative participants and cooperative non-participants) is analyzed, a meta-frontier analysis (MFA) model is constructed to empirical analyze the impact of farmers' participation in cooperatives on the efficiency of Chinese herbal medicine cultivation, and the heterogeneity of farmers that influence technical inefficiency is identified. The conclusions include: Two different ways to participate in the cultivation of GI products are through cooperatives and self-participation which keep farmers at different frontiers of production; The difference in efficiency within the rural cooperative is small but the efficiency of self-participating farmers is relatively large; The efficiency is about 32% higher, which explains the main reason for increase the efficiency of farmers are unified management, skill training and knowledge information diffusion.

Selection of diverse natural variations in heading date and photoperiod sensitivity is critical for adaptation of rice to different geographical environments. To unravel the genetic architecture underlying natural variation of rice flowering time, we conducted a genome wide association study (GWAS) using several association analysis strategies with a diverse worldwide collection of 529 O. sativa accessions. Heading date was investigated in three environments under long-day or short-day conditions, and photosensitivity was evaluated. By dividing the whole association panel into subpopulations and performing GWAS with both linear mixed models and multi-locus mixed-models, we revealed hundreds of significant loci harboring novel candidate genes as well as most of the known flowering time genes. In total, 127 hotspots were detected in at least two GWAS. Universal genetic heterogeneity was found across subpopulations. We further detected abundant interactions between GWAS loci, especially in indica. Functional gene families were revealed from enrichment analysis of the 127 hotspots. The results demonstrated a rich of genetic interactions in rice flowering time genes and such epistatic interactions contributed to the large portions of missing heritability in GWAS.

Research on ecosystem services (ESs) increasingly considers spatial heterogeneity in environmental management-related decision-making. This study quantified the dominant ESs and ES trade-offs for the Hengduan Mountain region in Southwest China. The spatial heterogeneity was analyzed by introducing gradients of elevation, vegetation cover, and land cover. The results showed that, in addition to inverse changes in ESs, ES change rates were important for ES trade-offs. Further, land cover was identified as the main factor influencing the spatial heterogeneity of the majority of ES trade-offs. Specifically, the net primary productivity (NPP), carbon storage (C), and habitat quality (HQ) all showed inverted U-shaped trends along the elevation gradient and HQ increased thereafter, water yield (WY) presented an overall decline but increased in high-altitude areas, and soil conservation (SC) exhibited a fluctuating trend. The change rate of SC was slower than that of NPP, C, and HQ, which led to changes in the trade-offs between SC and other ESs along the elevation gradient. The higher WY in built-up land and higher HQ in forests were the main reasons for higher trade-offs. The low trade-off for unused land was attributed to the limited levels of several ESs. Along the vegetation gradient, WY first decreased then increased, whereas all other services showed increasing trends. The limited promotion effect of vegetation on SC was the primary reason for increased trade-offs. Therefore, more attention should be devoted to improving SC via engineering measures. Furthermore, vegetation degradation on unused land should be prevented to maintain SC and reduce the trade-offs among ESs.",Ecosystem services,Trade-offs,Spatial heterogeneity,Gradients,Hengduan Mountain region,"Ge, Quansheng","Zhang, Xianzhou","Yu, Chengqun",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent genomic analyses have characterized genomic alterations and described gene expression profiling and epigenetic mechanisms in PTCL, leading to reveal molecular pathophysiology in detail. One of several important findings is that heterogeneities exist in both the disease and in individuals. Among PTCL subtypes, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) are common in Japan. ATLL is an incurable T-cell malignancy induced by human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). The global genomics of ATLL can be summarized as alterations involving T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling and immune escape mechanisms. This highlights the fact that ATLL is a viral-mediated T-cell malignancy. Interestingly, several previous studies have found that the genomics of ATLL differ according to geographical region and age at diagnosis, suggesting disease heterogeneity, though they share HTLV-1 infection as initial disease hit. Clonal expansion of the cells acquired by somatic mutations in ATLL-related genes is identified in a part of HTLV-1 carriers who developed ATLL later. The risk for ATLL may be updated based on findings in detail. PTCL-NOS is a heterogeneous disease type of T-cell lymphoma that does not correspond to any other type of PTCL. Several studies have stratified PTCL-NOS according to transcriptional, genomic, microenvironmental, and clinical aspects. These kinds of analysis from multiple aspects are useful to understand the heterogeneous group.

However, while climate niche conservatism varies markedly among regions and clades, the source of this variation remains poorly understood. We tested whether ecological opportunity can stimulate radiation within climate niche space at biogeographic scales, predicting that rates of climate niche evolution will scale with geographic area and climate heterogeneity.Location CaribbeanMethods We quantified two temperature axes (mean temperature and temperature seasonality of species' localities) of the climate niche for 130 Anolis species on Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, Jamaica and the northern and southern Lesser Antilles. Using a species-level phylogeny, we fitted macroevolutionary models that either constrained rates of climate niche evolution or allowed them to vary among regions. Next, we regressed region-specific evolutionary rates against area, species richness and climate heterogeneity. We evaluated whether results were robust to uncertainty in phylogenetic and biogeographic reconstructions and the assumed mode of evolution.Results For both niche axes, an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model that allowed the net rate of evolution (sigma(2)) to vary among island groups fit the data considerably better than a single-rate Brownian motion model. Nagelkerke pseudo-R-2 values of the fit of these OU models to mean temperature and seasonality axes were 0.43 and 0.66, respectively. Evolutionary rates for both axes were higher in larger areas, which also have more species. Only the rate of mean occupied temperature evolution was positively related to climate heterogeneity, and only after accounting for region size.Conclusions Rates of climate niche evolution scale consistently with the area available for radiation, but responses to climate heterogeneity vary among niche axes. For the mean temperature axis, climate heterogeneity generated additional opportunities for radiation, but for seasonality it did not. Overall, the physical setting in which a clade diversifies can influence where it falls on the evolutionary continuum, from climate niche conservatism to radiation.",Adaptive radiation,Anolis,climate heterogeneity,climate niche,ecological opportunity,,,,,,,evolutionary rates,,,island biogeography,,niche conservatism,niche evolution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiple efforts are currently focused on the development of models to better predict distribution range shifts due to GCC. We addressed this issue by including intraspecific genetic structure and spatial autocorrelation (SAC) of data in distribution range models. Both factors reflect the joint effect of ecoevolutionary processes on the geographical heterogeneity of populations. We used a collection of 301 georeferenced accessions of the annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana in its Iberian Peninsula range, where the species shows strong geographical genetic structure. We developed spatial and nonspatial hierarchical Bayesian models (HBMs) to depict current and future distribution ranges for the four genetic clusters detected. We also compared the performance of HBMs with Maxent (a presence-only model). Maxent and nonspatial HBMs presented some shortcomings, such as the loss of accessions with high genetic admixture in the case of Maxent and the presence of residual SAC for both. As spatial HBMs removed residual SAC, these models showed higher accuracy than nonspatial HBMs and handled the spatial effect on model outcomes. The ease of modelling and the consistency among model outputs for each genetic cluster was conditioned by the sparseness of the populations across the distribution range. Our HBMs enrich the toolbox of software available to evaluate GCC-induced distribution range shifts by considering both genetic heterogeneity and SAC, two inherent properties of any organism that should not be overlooked.",Arabidopsis thaliana,geographical genetic structure,global climate change,hierarchical Bayesian models,Maxent,"Fortin, Marie-Josee","Alonso-Blanco, Carlos","Xavier Pico, F.","Marcer, Arnald",,,>,,,spatial autocorrelation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Providing personalized savings information can thus inform and better motivate those consumers who would save more. Abatement costs for carbon and electricity use are similarly heterogenous as consumer economic benefits, indicating that adoption by heavy users is in the public as well as private interest. The cost of abating carbon via a utility appliance rebate program varies greatly by consumer. To scope the emission benefits of targeted adoption, we find that adoption by heavy users saves around 3 times more carbon than an average user for 10% participation in an efficiency program.",ENERGY STAR,Rebates,Efficiency program,Policy,Heterogeneity,"Hittinger, Eric","Chen, Roger",,,,,Behavior,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our main goal is to assess whether structural heterogeneity in the context of the ""urban-rural dichotomy"" and international borders can explain differences in the regions' engagement in inter-regional innovation cooperation. We estimate a gravity equation to model innovation cooperation, proxied by inter-regional co-patent applications, as a function of region-specific context conditions as well as technological and geographical distance. Our data comprise dyadic information on 203 NUTS2 regions in 15 European countries (EU-15) for the year 2010. The empirical results show that the basic gravity mechanisms drive the direction and strength of innovation cooperation between EU regions; i.e., geographical distance acts as an impediment to inter-regional co-patent applications. Regarding the importance of structural heterogeneity, we find that pairs of rural regions have lower levels of innovation cooperation compared to urban regions. Similarly, border regions are generally disadvantaged compared to non-border regions in terms of the intensity of innovation cooperation. However, while the latter result points to a negative border effect, our gravity model estimates also show that pairs of border regions are more active in terms of close geographical innovation cooperation (e.g., through international cross-border cooperation), which partly compensates for the negative border effect. This finding not only holds for urban but also rural border regions and may reflect policy attempts to support border regions, e.g., by strengthening the level of international cross-border cooperation within the EU.",Innovation cooperation,Co-patent applications,Structural heterogeneity,Rural-urban dichotomy,International borders,"Mitze, Timo",,,,,,Knowledge networks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The variable localized climates and topographic complexity of the Taihang Mountains make them a major natural boundary in Northern China that influences the divergence of organisms distributed across this region. Opisthopappus is an endemic genus of the Taihang Mountains that includes only two spatially partitioned species Opisthopappus longilobus and Opisthopappus taihangensis. For this study, the mechanisms behind the genetic variations in Opisthopappus populations were investigated. Results Using SNP and InDel data coupled with geographic and climatic information, significant genetic differentiation was found to exist either between Opisthopappus populations or two species. All studied populations were divided into two genetic groups with the differentiation of haplotypes between the groups. At approximately 17.44 Ma of the early Miocene, O. taihangensis differentiated from O. longilobus under differing precipitation regimes due to the intensification of the Asian monsoon. Subsequently, intraspecific divergence might be induced by the dramatic climatic transformation from the mid- to late Miocene. During the Pleistocene period, the rapid uplift of the Taihang Mountains coupled with violent climatic oscillations would further promote the diversity of the two species. Following the development of the Taihang Mountains, its complex topography created geographical and ecological heterogeneity, which could lead to spatiotemporal isolation between the Opisthopappus populations. Thus the adaptive divergence might occur within these intraspecific populations in the localized heterogeneous environment of the Taihang Mountains.

Our empirical study indicates that the R-2 and R-adj(2) values of E-RGWR are 0.8644 and 0.8642, which are 10.98% and 11.01% higher than those of GWR, and 3.26% and 3.27% higher than those of RGWR, respectively. In addition, through an analysis of related variables, the quantitative impacts of greening rate, distance to market, distance to hospitals. and construction time on housing prices in Beijing are found to present significant spatial discrete heterogeneity, and a positive relationship between school districts and housing prices was also observed. The obtained evaluation results indicate that E-RGWR can explain the spatial instability of housing prices in Beijing and the spatial discrete heterogeneity caused by education factors. Finally, based on the estimation results of the E-RGWR model, regarding housing prices in Beijing, we analyze the relationships between enrollment policy, real estate sales policy, and housing prices, E-RGWR can provide policy makers with more refined evidence to understand the nature of the centralized change relationship of Beijing's housing price data in a well-defined manner. The government should not only carry out macro-control, but also implement precise policies for different regions, refine social governance, promote education equity, and boost the economy.",GWR,RGWR,spatial discrete heterogeneity,house price valuation,,"Zhao, Yangyang",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It evaluates the influence of the heterogeneity of this territory, including relief and elevation, based on climatic-geographical types. Methods: Phenological stages, including leaf unfolding, full leaves, leaf coloring, and leaf fall, were monitored at 40 phenological stations across eight elevation zones. The study assesses trends in the occurrence of phenological stages, the length of the growing season, and phenological elevation gradients. Results: The results indicate a statistically significant earlier onset of spring phenological phases and delay in autumn phases, resulting in an average extension of the beech growing season by 12 days. Our findings confirm that the lengthening of the growing season due to warming, as an expression of climate change, is predominantly attributed to the warming in the spring months. The detected delayed onset of autumn phenophases was not due to warming in the autumn months, but other environmental factors influence it. The trend of elongation of the growing season (p<0.01) is observed in all elevation zones, with a less significant trend observed only in zones around 400 and 600 m a.s.l, signaling changes in environmental conditions across most of the elevation spectrum. Moreover, the heterogeneity of climatic-geographical types within each elevation zone increases the variability in the duration of the growing season for sites with similar elevations. By extending the growing season, it is assumed that the beech area will be changed to locations with optimal environmental conditions, especially in terms of adverse climatic events (late spring frosts, drought) during the growing season. The phenological elevation gradients reveal an earlier onset of 2.2 days per 100 m for spring phenophases and a delay of 1.1-2.9 days per 100 m for autumn phenophases. Discussion: These findings highlight the specific environmental conditions of European beech in the Western Carpathians and their potential for anticipating changes in its original area. Additionally, these observations can aid in forecasting the further development of phenological manifestations related to climate change.",phenology,European beech,climate change,Western Carpathians,trend,"Vido, Jaroslav","Snopkova, Zora","Skvarenina, Jaroslav",,,,relief,,,elevation,,heterogeneity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach This paper estimates technical efficiency based on the true random-effects stochastic production frontier estimator with a Mundlak adjustment. By utilising comprehensive panel data with 4,694 observations from 39 districts of four major maize-producing regions in Ethiopia, the author measures technical efficiency and examine its determinants while disentangling unobserved time-invariant heterogeneity from technical inefficiency. By using competing stochastic production frontier estimators, the author provides insights into the influence of farm heterogeneity on measuring farm efficiency and the subsequent impact on the ranking of farmers based on their efficiency scores. Findings The study results indicate that ignoring unobservable farmer heterogeneity leads to a downwards bias of technical efficiency estimates with a consequent effect on the ranking of farmers based on their efficiency scores. The mean technical efficiency score implied that about a 34% increase in maize productivity can be achieved with the current input use and technology in Ethiopia. The key determinants of the technical inefficiency of maize farmers are the age, gender and formal education level of the household head, household size, income, livestock ownership, and participation in off-farm activities. Research limitations/implications While the findings of this study are critical for informing policy on improving agricultural production and productivity, a few important things are worth considering in terms of the generalisability of the findings. First, the study relied on secondary data, so only a snapshot of environmental factors was accounted for in the empirical estimations. Second, there could be other sources of unmeasured potential sources of heterogeneity caused by persistent technical inefficiency and endogeneity of inputs. Third, the study is limited to one country. Therefore, future research should extend the analysis to ensure the generalisability of the empirical findings regarding the extent to which unmeasured potential sources of heterogeneity caused by persistent technical inefficiency, endogeneity of inputs and other unobservable country-specific features - such as geographical differences. Originality/value This paper contributes to the literature on agricultural productivity and efficiency by providing new evidence on the influence of unobservable heterogeneity in a farm efficiency analysis. While agricultural production is characterised by heterogeneous production conditions, the influence of unobservable farm heterogeneity has generally been ignored in technical efficiency estimations, particularly in the context of smallholder farming.

Yet, environmental representativeness is generally overlooked in existing sampling designs, and there are no user-friendly tools available for grassroots investigators that account for transportation accessibility and phased funding. We developed a novel sampling site selection approach using Marxan, by simply modifying default input datasets to include geographical and environmental data and transportation accessibility. Using the NuSalween River as a case study, we compiled an occurrence database of freshwater fish and then designed phased sampling strategies aiming at optimizing the coverage of species through geographical and environmental gradients, improving cost-effectiveness, and ensuring sampling feasibility compared to a random approach. Our approach was highly flexible in determining the optimal number of sampling units based on the number of surveying features (i.e., geographical units and environmental clusters). The output and visualization of the geographical locations of newly added sampling sites were adaptable to sampling strategies with phased funding. Compared to the random approach, the Marxan approach showed a two-fold increase in the mean species richness for selected sampling units and improved sampling effectiveness by 81.18 % (+/- 0.83 %) and cost efficiency by 81.75 % (+/- 0.02 %).

Studying the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of customer preferences is crucial to engineering design as it provides a dynamic perspective for understanding the trend of customer preferences. However, existing choice models for demand modeling do not take the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of customer preferences into consideration. Learning-based spatiotemporal data modeling methods usually require large-scale datasets for model training, which are not applicable to small aggregated data, such as the sale records of a product in several regions and years. To fill this research gap, we propose a spatial panel modeling approach to investigate the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of customer preferences. Product and regional attributes varying in time are included as model inputs to support demand forecasting in engineering design. With case studies using the dataset of small SUVs and compact sedans in China's automotive market, we demonstrate that the spatial panel modeling approach outperforms other statistical spatiotemporal data models and non-parametric regression methods in goodness of fit and prediction accuracy. We also illustrate a potential design application of the proposed approach in a portfolio optimization of two vehicles from the same producer. While the spatial panel modeling approach exists in econometrics, applying this approach to support engineering decisions by considering spatiotemporal heterogeneity and introducing engineering attributes in demand forecasting is the contribution of this work.

This study argues that failing to capture students' out-migration within their states of residence may overestimate the positive returns of ""out-migrating"" by underestimating the effect of attending college ""in state."" Accordingly, the purpose of the study was 2-fold. First, it relied on geographical network analysis to offer a framework that disaggregated the sole measure of in-state enrollment into (a) nearby college enrollment and (b) within-state out-migration. Second, it tested the impact of these newly proposed conceptualizations of students' out-migration decisions on educational and financial outcomes.

The Yihe River Basin (YRB) in central China's Henan province, which is located in the north-south transition zone and has a mountain-hill-plain landscape from the upstream to the downstream, is adopted as the research area in this study. A watershed ecosystem health assessment system is constructed based on an ecosystem vigor-organization-resilience-service supply and demand harmony (EVORSH) framework and utilized to assess the ecosystem health in the YRB by taking a 3 km x 3 km grid as the evaluation unit. Thirteen factors are selected from natural and human social factors, and from them, the factors that influence watershed ecosystem health through the generation of spatial heterogeneity are identified using the geographical detector model. The following findings are obtained. (1) The mean value of ecosystem health levels in the YRB is 0.65 and at the good level. The ecosystem health has considerable spatial heterogeneity. The areas with high-high concentration are distributed in the mountains in the upper reaches of the YRB, and the areas with low-low concentration are mainly distributed in the plain areas in the middle reaches of the YRB. (2) The geographical detector result shows that 9 of 13 factors have a considerable impact on the spatial distribution of the YRB's ecosystem health. The interaction between two factors is enhanced synergically. The decisive power of population density, rainfall, and potential evapotranspiration are more than 0.5, so these three are the main factors that influence the distribution of ecosystem health in the YRB. (3) The EVORSH framework is suitable for the measurement of ecosystem health in the YRB. The evaluation result is consistent with the actual situation in the YRB. A 3 km x 3 km grid is used as the basic research unit, and it can more accurately and scientifically express the spatial heterogeneity of ecosystem health in the YRB compared with the macro evaluation unit. This study can provide a scientific basis for ecological protection and high-quality development planning in the YRB.

However, TB's spatial features and risk factors in urban areas remain poorly understood. This study aims to identify the spatial differentiations and potential influencing factors of TB in highly urbanized regions on a fine scale.Methods: This study included 18 socioeconomic and environmental variables in the four central districts of Guangzhou, China. TB case data obtained from the Guangzhou Institute of Tuberculosis Control and Prevention. Before using Pearson correlation and a geographical detector (GD) to identify potential influencing factors, we conducted a global spatial autocorrelation analysis to select an appropriate spatial scales.Results: Owing to its strong spatial autocorrelation (Moran's / = 0.33, Z= 4.71), the 2 km x 2 km grid was selected as the spatial scale. At this level,TB incidence was closely associated with most socioeconomic variables (0.31 P < 0.01). Of five environmental factors, only the concentration of fine particulate matter displayed significant correlation (r= 0.21, P < 0.05).

According to the GrantStebbins model speciation begins with adaptive local differentiation in the response to spatial heterogeneity in pollinators. Although this crucial process links the micro- and macroevolution of floral adaptation, it has received little attention. In this study geographical phenotypic variation was investigated in Patagonian Calceolaria polyrhiza and its pollinators, two oil-collecting bee species that differ in body size and geographical distribution.Patterns of phenotypic variation were examined together with their relationships with pollinators and abiotic factors. Six floral and seven vegetative traits were measured in 45 populations distributed across the entire species range. Climatic and edaphic parameters were determined for 25 selected sites, 216 bees per site of the most frequent pollinator species were captured, and a critical flowerbee mechanical fitting trait involved in effective pollination was measured. Geographical patterns of phenotypic and environmental variation were examined using uni- and multivariate analyses. Decoupled geographical variation between corolla area and floral traits related to the mechanical fit of pollinators was explored using a Mantel test.The body length of pollinators and the floral traits related to mechanical fit were strongly correlated with each other. Geographical variation of the mechanical-fit-related traits was decoupled from variation in corolla size; the latter had a geographical pattern consistent with that of the vegetative traits and was mainly affected by climatic gradients.The results are consistent with pollinators playing a key role in shaping floral phenotype at a geographical scale and promoting the differentiation of two floral ecotypes. The relationship between the critical floral-fit-related trait and bee length remained significant even in models that included various environmental variables and an allometric predictor (corolla area). The abiotic environment also has an important role, mainly affecting floral size.

However, the cyclical or seasonal variations in the temporal dimension of most spatiotemporal processes are rarely considered along with spatiotemporal non-stationarity. Seasonal variations are widespread and typical in marine environmental processes, and addressing both spatiotemporal heterogeneity and seasonal variations is particularly difficult in the turbid and optically complex coastal seas. By incorporating seasonal periodic effects into a geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model, we proposed a geographically and cycle-temporally weighted regression (GcTWR) model. To test its performance, modelling of chlorophyll-alpha, known as an important indicator of the coastal environment, is performed using the in situ data collected from 2012 to 2016 in the coastal sea of Zhejiang Province, China. GcTWR is compared with global ordinary least squares (OLS), geographically weighted regression (GWR), cycle-temporally weighted regression (cTWR), and GTWR models. In the results, the GcTWR model decreases absolute errors by 89.74%, 79.77%, 76.60% and 29.83% relative to the OLS, GWR, cTWR, and GTWR models, and presents a higher R-2 (0.9274) than the GWR (0.5911), cTWR (0.6465), and GTWR (0.8721) models. The estimation results further confirm that the seasonal influences in coastal areas are much more significant than the interannual effects, which accordingly demonstrates that extending the GTWR model to handle both spatiotemporal heterogeneity and seasonal variations are meaningful.

Using regression analysis with auto spatial correlation, we explored the geographical transformation of urban sprawl between 1992 and 2015 in China and explained the dynamic changes from the perspectives of population, economy and ecology. The major conclusions drawn are listed as follows. First, although the built-up area in all the cities across China maintained an increasing trend during 1992-2015, the pace of expansion changed massively in different periods. The expansion of urban built-up area was accelerated noticeably during the period of 2000-2010 prior to a slowdown post 2010. Second, there was a significant regional variation in urban built-up area and urban sprawl in China. Urban agglomeration in the coastal areas and the provincial capital showed a distinctive trend of growth, especially during 2000-2010. Since 2010, cities located in the central, north and northeast plains grew into larger cities due to sufficient flat lands for urban expansion. Third, the residential population was among the deciding factors for urban expansion while the registered population had a negative correlation with urban built-up area in China. The cities in the plain areas enjoyed the advantages in land supply for urban expansion, which may be affected by the local extensive land use policies. Economic factor was not a significant driving force, except in the west region, which may be a result from the different industrial and economic structures between regions. Finally, we suggested applying different policies in different regions. As an ecologically fragile region, the limitations of terrain and natural resources should be highlighted, especially in the west region. Furthermore, accounting for the slowdown of urban sprawl across China, more policies should focus attention on the quality of stock land within cities.",Urban sprawl,Geographic transformation,Driving factors,China,,"Fu, Bojie","Wang, Kevin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on comparison of four evaluation methods (namely, the classic statistical method, geostatistical method, information theory method, and fractal method), this study proposed a new scheme for evaluating the spatial heterogeneity of LSHCs. This scheme incorporates diverse remotely sensed surface parameters, e.g., leaf area index-LAI, the normalized difference vegetation index-NDVI, net radiation-Rn, and land surface temperature-LST. The LSHCs can be classified into three categories, namely homogeneous, moderately heterogeneous and highly heterogeneous based on the remotely sensed LAI data with a 30 m spatial resolution and the combination of normalized information entropy (S ') and coefficient of variation (CV). Based on the evaluation scheme, the spatial heterogeneity of land surface hydrothermal conditions at six typical flux observation stations in the Heihe River Basin during the vegetation growing season were evaluated. The evaluation results were consistent with the land surface type characteristics exhibited by Google Earth imagery and spatial heterogeneity assessed by high resolution remote sensing evapotranspiration data. Impact factors such as precipitation and irrigation events, spatial resolutions of remote sensing data, heterogeneity in the vertical direction, topography and sparse vegetation could also affect the evaluation results. For instance, short-term changes (precipitation and irrigation events) in the spatial heterogeneity of LSHCs can be diagnosed by energy factors, while long-term changes can be indicated by vegetation factors. The spatial heterogeneity of LSHCs decreases when decreasing the spatial resolution of remote sensing data. The proposed evaluation scheme would be useful for the quantification of spatial heterogeneity of LSHCs over flux observation stations toward the global scale, and also contribute to the improvement of the accuracy of estimation and validation for remotely sensed (or model simulated) evapotranspiration.",land surface hydrothermal conditions (LSHCs),evapotranspiration,spatial heterogeneity,remote sensing,evaluation scheme,"Hu, Xiao","Wang, Jianghao","Li, Xiang","Xu, Ziwei","Ma, Yanfei","Liu, Rui",,"Xu, Tongren","Yang, Xiaofan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study describes asthma triggers using a large-scale electronic dataset from the smartphone-based Chinese Children's Asthma Action Plan (CCAAP) app and aims to examine the difference in asthma triggers among different subgroups of children with asthma.Methods: Data from the smartphone-based CCAAP app between February 22, 2017, and November 23, 2020, were reviewed, and children with asthma who reported their asthma triggers were enrolled. Eight common asthma triggers were listed in the software: upper respiratory infection (URI), allergen sensitization, exercise, emotional disturbances, pungent odors, air pollution/smog, weather change, and tobacco smoke. We compared the incidence of asthma triggers among different subgroups (<6 years vs. 6-17 years; boy vs. girl; eastern region vs. central region vs. western region).Results: We enrolled 6,835 patients with self-reported asthma triggers. When compared by sex, boys had a higher proportion of exercise-triggered asthma than girls (boys vs. girls, 22.5 vs. 19.7%, p < 0.05). The proportion of patients <6 years of age with URI-triggered asthma was higher than that of patients 6-17 years of age (<6 vs. 6-17 years, 80.9 vs. 74.9%, p < 0.001). Patients 6-17 years of age were more likely than patients <6 years of age to report five of the asthma triggers: allergen sensitization (<6 vs. 6-17 years, 26.6 vs. 35.8%, p < 0.001), exercise (<6 vs. 6-17 years, 19.3 vs. 23.7%, p < 0.001), pungent odors (<6 vs. 6-17 years, 8.8 vs. 12.7%, p < 0.001), air pollution/smog (<6 vs. 6-17 years, 9.4 vs. 16.2%, p < 0.001), and tobacco smoke (<6 vs. 6-17 years, 3.5 vs. 5.3%, p < 0.001). In subgroups based on geographical distribution, asthma triggering of allergen sensitization was reported to be the most common in patients from the eastern region (eastern region vs. central region vs. western region, 35.0 vs. 24.6 vs. 28.0%, p < 0.001). Exercise-triggered asthma was found to be the most prevalent among patients from the central region (eastern region vs. central region vs. western region, 21.6 vs. 24.8 vs. 20.4%, p < 0.05). However, the proportion of patients with air pollution/smog as an asthma trigger was the lowest among those from the western region (eastern region vs. central region vs. western region, 14.1 vs. 14.1 vs. 10.8%, p < 0.05).Conclusion: Children with asthma present different types of asthma triggers, both allergenic and nonallergenic.

Recently, three independent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) confirmed that HLA-A is the main risk gene for NPC. However, the results of studies conducted in regions with dissimilar incidence rates contradicted the claims that HLA-A is the sole risk gene and that the association of rs29232 is independent of the HLA-A effect in the chromosome 6p21.3 region.Methods: We performed a meta-analysis, selecting five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in chromosome 6p21.3 mapped in three published GWASs and four case-control studies. The studies involved 8994 patients with NPC and 11,157 healthy controls, all of whom were Han Chinese.Results: The rs2517713 SNP located downstream of HLA-A was significantly associated with NPC (P = 1.08 x 10(-91), odds ratio [OR] = 0.58, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0.55-0.61). The rs29232 SNP exhibited a moderate level of heterogeneity (I-2 = 47 %) that disappeared (I-2 = 0 %) after stratification by moderate-and high-incidence NPC regions.Conclusions: Our results suggested that the HLA-A gene is strongly associated with NPC risk. In addition, the heterogeneity revealed by the meta-analysis of rs29232 might be associated with regional differences in NPC incidence among Han Chinese people. The higher OR of rs29232 and the fact that rs29232 was independent of the HLA-A effect in the moderate-incidence population suggested that rs29232 might have greater relevance to NPC incidence in a moderate-incidence population than in a high-incidence population.",,,,,,"Shugart, Yin Yao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exploring the spatial drivers of flood disasters on a macroscopic scale is of great significance for mitigating their impacts. This study proposes a comprehensive framework for integrating driving-factor optimization and interpretability, while considering spatial heterogeneity. In this framework, the Optimal Parameter-based Geographic Detector (OPGD), Recursive Feature Estimation (RFE), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) models were utilized to construct the OPGD-RFE-LGBM coupled model to identify the essential driving factors and simulate the spatial distribution of flood disasters. The SHapley Additive ExPlanation (SHAP) interpreter was employed to quantitatively explain the driving mechanisms behind the spatial distribution of flood disasters. Yunnan Province, a typical mountainous and plateau area in Southwest China, was selected to implement the proposed framework and conduct a case study. For this purpose, a flood disaster inventory of 7332 historical events was prepared, and 22 potential driving factors related to precipitation, surface environment, and human activity were initially selected. Results revealed that flood disasters in Yunnan Province exhibit high spatial heterogeneity, with geomorphic zoning accounting for 66.1% of the spatial variation in historical flood disasters. The OPGD-RFE-LGBM coupled model offers clear advantages over a single LGBM in identifying essential driving factors and quantitatively analyzing their impacts. Moreover, the simulation performance shows a slight improvement (a 6% average decrease in RMSE and an average increase of 1% in R2) even with reduced factor data. Factor explanatory analysis indicated that the combination of the essential driving factor sets varied across different subregions; nevertheless, precipitation-related factors, such as precipitation intensity index (SDII), wet days (R10MM), and 5-day maximum precipitation (RX5day), were the main driving factors controlling flood disasters. This study provides a quantitative analytical framework for the spatial drivers of flood disasters at large scales with significant heterogeneity, offering a reference for disaster management authorities in developing macro-strategies for disaster prevention.

This results in geographical clusters of residual transmission in the dry, low transmission season, which can fuel the transmission to wider areas or populations during the wet season. A better understanding of spatial clustering of malaria can lead to a more efficient, targeted strategy to reduce malaria transmission. This study aims to evaluate the potential of the use of serological markers to define spatial patterns in malaria exposure.Methods: Blood samples collected in a community-based randomized trial performed in 98 high endemic communities in Ratanakiri province, north-eastern Cambodia, were screened with a multiplex serological assay for five serological markers (three Plasmodium falciparum and two Plasmodium vivax). The antibody half-lives range from approximately six months until more than two years. Geographical heterogeneity in malaria transmission was examined using a spatial scan statistic on serology, PCR prevalence and malaria incidence rate data. Furthermore, to identify behavioural patterns or intrinsic factors associated with malaria exposure (antibody levels), risk factor analyses were performed by using multivariable random effect logistic regression models. The serological outcomes were then compared to PCR prevalence and malaria incidence data.Results: A total of 6502 samples from two surveys were screened in an area where the average parasite prevalence estimated by PCR among the selected villages is 3.4 %. High-risk malaria pockets were observed adjacent to the 'Tonle San River' and neighbouring Vietnam for all three sets of data (serology, PCR prevalence and malaria incidence rates). The main risk factors for all P. falciparum antigens and P. vivax MSP1.19 are age, ethnicity and staying overnight at the plot hut.Conclusion: It is possible to identify similar malaria pockets of higher malaria transmission together with the potential risk factors by using serology instead of PCR prevalence or malaria incidence data. In north-eastern Cambodia, the serological markers show that malaria transmission occurs mainly in adults staying overnight in plot huts in the field. Pf.GLURP.R2 showed a shrinking pocket of malaria transmission over time, and Pf.MSP1.19, CSP, PvAMA1 were also informative for current infection to a lesser extent. Therefore, serology could contribute in future research.

The Tanaka line, extending within southwestern China from its northwest to its southeast, is an important biogeographical boundary between the Sino-Japanese and Sino-Himalayan floristic regions. Understanding the evolutionary history of the regional keystone species would assist with both reconstructing historical vegetation dynamics and ongoing biodiversity management. In this research, we combined phylogeographic methodologies and species distribution models (SDMs) to investigate the spatial genetic patterns and distribution dynamics of Quercus kerrii, a dominant evergreen oak inhabiting southwest China lowland evergreen-broadleaved forests (EBLFs). A total of 403 individuals were sampled from 44 populations throughout southwest China. SDMs and mismatch distribution analysis indicated that Q. kerrii has undergone northward expansion since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Quantitative analysis revealed that the range expansion of Q. kerrii since the LGM exceeded that of the sympatric mid-elevation species Quercus schottkyana, likely owing to their contrasting distribution elevations and habitat availabilities. The historical climate change since the LGM and the latitude gradient of the region played an important role in shaping the genetic diversity of Q. kerrii. The genetic differentiation index and genetic distance surface of Q. kerrii populations east of the Tanaka line exceeded those to its west. The long-term geographic isolation and environmental heterogeneity between the two sides of the Tanaka line might increase species divergence patterns and local adaptation.

However, the relationship between them and population distribution has regional heterogeneity in different geographic contexts. It is necessary to improve data processing methods and spatialization models in areas with large geographical differences. We used land cover data to extract human activity, nighttime light and point-of-interest (POI) data to represent human activity intensity, and considered differences in geographical context to divide mainland China into northern, southern and western regions. We constructed random forest models to generate gridded population distribution datasets with a resolution of 500 m, and quantitatively evaluated the importance of auxiliary data in different geographical contexts. The street-level accuracy assessment showed that our population dataset is more accurate than WorldPop, with a higher R2 and smaller deviation. The improved datasets provided broad potential for exploring the spatial-temporal changes in grid-level population distribution in China from 2010 to 2020. The results indicated that the population density and settlement area have increased, and the overall pattern of population distribution has remained highly stable, but there are significant differences in population change patterns among cities with different urbanization processes. The importance of the ancillary data to the models varied significantly, with POI contributing the most to the southern region and the least to the western region. Moreover, POI had relatively less influence on model improvement in undeveloped areas. Our study could provide a reference for predicting social and economic spatialized data in different geographical context areas using POI and multisource satellite data.",Population spatialization,Spatial-temporal pattern,Regional heterogeneity,Point of interest,Random forest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we provide subnational and sub-population estimates of three key HIV epidemiological indicators, which have been unavailable for most settings.Methods: We used surveillance data on newly diagnosed HIV cases from 2004 to 2014 and back-calculation modelling to estimate in France, at national and subnational levels, by exposure group and country of birth: the numbers of new HIV infections, the times to diagnosis, the numbers of undiagnosed HIV infections. The denominators used for rate calculations at national and subnational levels were based on population size (aged 18 to 64) estimates produced by the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies and the latest national surveys on sexual behaviour and drug use.Results: We estimated that, in 2014, national HIV incidence was 0.17 parts per thousand (95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.16 to 0.18) or 6607 (95% CI: 6057 to 7196) adults, undiagnosed HIV prevalence was 0.64 parts per thousand (95% CI: 0.57 to 0.70) or 24,197 (95% CI: 22,296 to 25,944) adults and median time to diagnosis over the 2011 to 2014 period was 3.3years (interquartile range: 1.2 to 5.7). Three mainland regions, including the Paris region, out of the 27 French regions accounted for 56% of the total number of new and undiagnosed infections. Incidence and undiagnosed prevalence rates were 2- to 10-fold higher than the national rates in three overseas regions and in the Paris region (p-values < 0.001). Rates of incidence and undiagnosed prevalence were higher than the national rates for the following populations (p-values < 0.001): born-abroad men who have sex with men (MSM) (respectively, 108- and 78-fold), French-born MSM (62- and 44-fold), born-abroad persons who inject drugs (14- and 18-fold), sub-Saharan African-born heterosexuals (women 15- and 15-fold, men 11- and 13-fold). Importantly, affected populations varied from one region to another, and in regions apparently less impacted by HIV, some populations could be as impacted as those living in most impacted regions.Conclusions: In France, some regions and populations have been most impacted by HIV.

Therefore, we analyse this question by applying an innovative approach called multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy (MAIHDA).Patients and Methods: We analysed 49,019 patients categorized into 18 sociodemographic contexts and 21 counties of residence. All patients had a hospital COPD diagnosis and had been on inhaled maintenance medication during the 5 years before the study baseline in 2010. We defined ""discontinuation"" as the absolute lack of retrieval from a pharmacy of any inhaled maintenance medication during 2011. We performed a cross-classified MAIHDA and obtained the average proportion of discontinuation, as well as county and sociodemographic absolute risks, and compared them with a proposed benchmark value of 10%. We calculated the variance partition coefficient (VPC) and the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) to quantify county and sociodemographic differences. To summarize the results, we used a framework with 15 scenarios defined by the size of the differences and the level of achievement in relation to the benchmark value.Results: Around 18% of COPD patients in Sweden discontinued maintenance medication, so the benchmark value was not achieved. There were very small county differences (VPC=0.35%, AUC=0.54). The sociodemographic differences were small (VPC=4.98%, AUC=0.57).Conclusion: Continuity of maintenance medication among COPD patients in Sweden could be improved by reducing the unjustifiably high prevalence of discontinuation. The very small county and small sociodemographic differences should motivate universal interventions across all counties and sociodemographic groups. Geographical analyses should be combined with sociodemographic analyses, and the cross-classified MAIHDA is an appropriate tool to assess health-care quality.",COPD,socioeconomic inequity,multilevel analysis,equity in health care,health care quality,"Ekberg-Jansson, Ann","Leckie, George","Perez-Vicente, Raquel","Merlo, Juan",,,compliance,,,discriminatory accuracy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study proposes a framework to identify and quantify the contributions of potential sources of trace elements in groundwater. Health risk assessment is first conducted to identify the trace elements with the highest threats to groundwater quality, and then the geographical detector is used to qualitatively investigate the potential sources and processes dominating the pollution from identified trace elements, and the absolute principal component scores-multivariate linear regression (APCS-MLR) is used to quantify the contributions of different sources to the accumulation of trace elements. The proposed approach was applied to China's Loess Plateau, a typical water-limited area with rapid urbanization and intensive agricultural activities, after conducting two groundwater sampling campaigns in a flood and a dry season. The trace element concentrations in groundwater exhibited significant spatial and seasonal differences. Health risk assessment revealed that Cr and As through oral ingestion were responsible for non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks in different seasons. Land use was the primary factor influencing the spatial heterogeneity of Cr in the flood season, while elevation and distance from city were dominant factors in the dry season. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and distance from city contributed the most to As change in the flood season, but NDVI was the major contributor in the dry season. The average contributions of potential pollution sources to trace elements in groundwater were in the order of natural source (35%) > geogenic process (17%) > industrial source (13%) in the flood season, but mixed sources (47%) > agricultural activities (18%) in the dry season. Distinguished from the traditional source apportionment methods, the newly proposed approach is not limited to identification of pollutant sources, but also can obtain the exact contributions of different sources.

Four locations, with different land use and substrate characteristics were used to determine the extent of biological crust cover and the factors affecting the spatial heterogeneity in soil nutrients and ecology. Despite the sandy texture of Kalahari soils and regular surface disturbances, there is a significant biological soil crust cover (19-40%) at all locations. This is due to a combination of resistance to trampling, sub-canopy niches protected from disturbance and the prevalence of Microcoleus vaginatus cyanobacteria, which are able to rapidly reform crusts. Crust cover and diversity is enhanced on ironstone and calcrete soils. The spatial variability of soil nutrients is low but is increased by grazing-induced bush encroachment. The preferential development of nitrogen-fixing biological soil crusts under bushes could enhance the competitive advantage of Acacia mellifera favouring further bush encroachment. Whether this constitutes land degradation is dependent upon the extent to which sub-bush canopy niches retain palatable grass species.

Here the drivers and mechanisms that best explain alpha- and beta-diversity of orchids in the Aegean Archipelago were explored. The analyses were based on (a) matrix of the total number of orchid taxa recorded on each island, and (b) matrix containing the number of grid cells of each island in which each orchid has been recorded. Based on these matrices, generalized linear models (GLMs) were then used to determine the most important factors (geographical, climatic, geological) associated with orchid richness. Generalized dissimilarity modelling (GDM) was used to explore whether there are specific patterns in beta-diversity and to evaluate contributions to individual factors to these patterns. To investigate the similarity of the Aegean islands in terms of their orchid flora, a beta-diversity abundance matrix was analyzed using non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination method. GLM analysis revealed that maximum elevation, index of bioclimatic breadth (IBB), neighbour index (NI), island area, and the percentage of granite, limestone and quartz at each island were the best predictors of orchid alpha-diversity. Maximum elevation, habitat heterogeneity, IBB and island area were positively associated with alpha-diversity, whereas neighbour index and the percentage of granite, limestone and quartz at each island were negatively associated. Maximum elevation, NI, habitat heterogeneity and geographical distance were the best predictors of orchid turnover across the Aegean islands, whereas IBB, granite and limestone were less important. The NMDS ordination revealed that islands are structured from the southernmost to the northernmost, in a way that in general conforms to the phytogeographical division of the Aegean Archipelago. The drivers that account for the patterns in alpha- and beta-diversity were associated with differences in the degrees of isolation and heterogeneity (climatic and habitat) of the islands. Among the predictors, elevation and IBB proved to be better surrogates of habitat heterogeneity than island area.",abundance data,generalized dissimilarity model,habitat heterogeneity,island biogeography,isolation,,,,,,,orchid richness and composition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, there are changes in sectoral employment, demographic changes and changes in the social structure of the population. Rural restructuring is understood as a process that affects different levels of individual sites, thus leading to an increase in the heterogeneity of rural areas. The aim of this paper is to describe the existing heterogeneity in the Czech countryside. In our research, we find whether there is a dependence of selected socio-economic indicators on the size groups of municipalities and the character of settlements in typological regions. As an indicator of the character of settlements OECD typology is used. This typology divides regions according to population density into significantly rural regions, predominantly rural regions and predominantly urban regions. The methodology of this paper is based on the evaluation of municipalities in relation to the OECD typology and size groups of municipalities. For each category of typology selected socio -economic characteristics (migration balance, sectoral employment, education structure and the unemployment rate) are observed. Furthermore, the differentiation of these indicators by size of municipality and district is analyzed. On the basis of indicators, it can be demonstrated that the smallest municipalities in rural areas have worse socioeconomic characteristics. The analysis also shows considerable diversification of selected indicators, depending on the geographical location of the region, which plays an important role in the process of rural restructuring.",Rural development,rural restructuring,rural heterogeneity,Czech Republic,,,,,,,,,,,,AGRARIAN PERSPECTIVES XXII: DEVELOPMENT TRENDS IN AGRIBUSINESS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, interactions with other organisms, such as pollinators, also have the potential to influence plant distributions. To investigate this, we developed niche models for 32 plant taxa that have specialized pollination systems and which are native to a biodiversity hotspot (South Africa). We found that the distributions of these taxa are best explained by a combination of biotic (pollinators) and abiotic factors, rather than by abiotic factors alone. For approximately 66% of these plant taxa, pollinator distributions were the factor that provided the best predictor of their niches. Furthermore, co-occurrence of these plants and their pollinators was generally not explained solely by shared abiotic niches, and thus probably reflects broad-scale positive ecological interactions. These results are consistent with the proposal that pollinator distributions may constrain plant distributions and highlight the general potential for species distributions to be shaped by positive interactions with other species. This has important consequences for predicting howdistributions of species might change in the face of loss of their key mutualists.",environmental heterogeneity,facilitation,mutualism,niche,species distributions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The urban environment was examined using composite criteria related to natural, built and socioeconomic environment, housing conditions, public services and infrastructures, and cultural and recreational facilities. Each criterion constructed from a set of mappable sub-criteria/variables. Weighted cartographic overlay was implemented to assess the overall urban quality of life of each spatial unit, based on the importance the residents of the area attributed to each criterion. High levels of quality of life were revealed in the eastern neighborhoods of the municipality, whereas low levels were noticed mainly in the western neighborhoods. The results of the study were validated using the perceived quality of life of the study area's residents, resulting in substantial agreement. Finally, after spatial autocorrelation analysis, significant clustering of urban quality of life in Athens was revealed.

Such problems have gained urgency in China during recent years. However, there has been no research on the relationship between drug dealing and associated factors and its variation over space at a fine scale, such as the police station management area (PSMA), in China. Based on a seven-year data set obtained in ZG city, China, a geographically weighted Poisson regression (GWPR) model was employed to explore the spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between drug dealing and related risk factors, including social-demographic factors and environmental characteristics. The model results indicated that there were more drug dealings in the socially disorganized areas, typically associated with urban villages and floating population. Spatial accessibility had significant impacts on drug dealing. While the main road showed a negative effect, areas with more branch roads and bus stops tended to attract more drug dealings. Additionally, we found that these relationships were spatially nonstationary across space. This research represents the first in discerning spatial variation of drug dealing within a major Chinese city.

We examined whether socio-ecological factors affected the spatial distribution and their interactive effects. Methods: Moran's I was applied to first examine the spatial cluster of dengue fever in Guangzhou. Nine socio-ecological factors were chosen to represent the urbanization level, economy, accessibility, environment, and the weather of the 167 townships/streets in Guangzhou, and then the geographical detector was applied to analyze the individual and interactive effects of these factors on the dengue outbreak. Results: Four clusters of dengue fever were identified in Guangzhou in 2014, including one hot spot in the central area of Guangzhou and three cold spots in the suburban districts. For individual effects, the temperature (q = 0.33) was the dominant factor of dengue fever, followed by precipitation (q = 0.24), road density (q = 0.24), and water body area (q = 0.23). For the interactive effects, the combination of high precipitation, high temperature, and high road density might result in increased dengue fever incidence. Moreover, urban villages might be the dengue fever hot spots. Conclusions: Our study suggests that some socio-ecological factors might either separately or jointly influence the spatial distribution of dengue fever in Guangzhou.",dengue fever,socio-ecological factors,geographical detectors,GIS and RS,,"Li, Xing","Wang, Jin","Lin, Hualiang","Chen, Lingling","Wu, Zhifeng","Ma, Wenjun",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current machine learning-based spatial interpolation methods are subject to the statistical constraints of spatial stratified heterogeneity (SSH), normally involving separate modeling of each stratum and simple weighted averaging to integrate intra-stratum and inter-strata features. However, these models overlook the different contributions of inter-strata features to different locations within a stratum (heterogeneous inter-strata associations, HIA) and the explanation of spatial effects on the interpolation process, leading to suboptimal and unreliable interpolation outcomes. This article proposes a novel explainable spatial interpolation method considering SSH (X-SSHM). Spatial and environmental features are utilized to describe intra-stratum and inter-strata information, which are fed into random forest-based learners to achieve high-level semantic feature mapping. Geographically weighted regression is employed to integrate intra-stratum and inter-strata features to achieve a unified expression of SSH and HIA, obtaining the final interpolation result. Geographically weighted Shapley (GSHAP) is proposed to decompose the marginal contributions of intra-stratum and inter-strata features. Model performance is evaluated on simulated and soil organic matter datasets. X-SSHM outperformed five baselines regarding interpolation accuracy. Moreover, statistical methods validated X-SSHM's ability to elucidate the mechanisms by which SSH, spatial autocorrelation and HIA affect the model interpolation process.",Spatial interpolation,spatial association,spatial heterogeneity,explainability,,"Luo, Peng","Wang, Lizeng","Lu, Feng",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, this paper first analyses the relationship between the breadth, depth of ETA and enterprises' innovation performance with patent transaction data of listed manufacturing enterprises in China. Then we further investigate how GD moderates the relationship. Results show that both the breadth and depth of ETA positively affect enterprises' innovation performance.

The existing studies mainly focused on the various impacts of urbanization on ES supply, however, there is still a lack of comprehensive research on the spatial heterogeneity response of ES supply, demand and supply-demand ratio (i.e., surplus or deficit) to urbanization, especially at the national scale. To fill this gap, we measured the spatiotemporal changes of ES supply, demand and supply-demand ratios in China utilizing the ecological footprint model at the county scale of resolution. Additionally, the Geographical Weighted Regression (GWR) model was used to explore the spatial heterogeneity response of ES supply, demand and supply-demand ratios to different types of urbanization (i.e., population, economic and land). The results showed that areas with larger total ES demand was mainly concentrated in the Northeast Plain, Liaodong Peninsula, North China Plain, Pearl River Delta, Southeast coastal areas, and Sichuan Basin, while the northwest, northeast and north of China had the greater total ES supply. The counties with strong ES deficit were found in southeastern China, while, most counties in northwestern China were in ES surplus. Additionally, there was significant spatial heterogeneity influence of different types of urbanization on ES in China. Population urbanization in the southeast and south of China had a strong positive impact on the supply-demand ratio in 2000 and 2015, while economic urbanization in the northwest and south regions exerted a more remarkable positive influence. The greater positive impact of land urbanization on the supply-demand ratios was mostly concentrated in northwest China in 2000, and this effect also appeared in southeast China in 2015. Moreover, land urbanization presented a more direct and dominant impact on the ES supply, demand and supply-demand ratios than population and economic urbanization. The findings highlighted that we should focus on the impact of urban expansion on the ecosystem, formulating rational land use planning and optimizing urban spatial configurations, can be used to offset the ES deficit and realize regional sustainable development.",Spatially heterogeneity response,Urbanization,Ecosystem services supply and demand,Supply-demand ratio,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This framework, which accounts for spatial heterogeneity demonstrated strong goodness-of-fit and prediction capa-bility, which has been ignored in previous studies. Furthermore, the proposed framework contributed to modeling based on geographical weighted regression and global machine learning models. Local relative importance mapping of built environment variables revealed varying impacts across Shanghai, diverging from the common practice of averaging into a single value in global machine learning models. Additionally, the nonlinear relationship between influencing variables, such as leisure and shopping, demonstrated a positive trend with boarding and alighting ridership in different periods, and spatio-temporal heterogeneity with the effective range and threshold effect.

In this study, using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a proxy of vegetation growth status and coverage, we analyzed the temporal and spatial characteristics of the NDVI in China's Inner Mongolian grasslands using Theil-Sen slope statistics and Mann-Kendall trend test methods. In addition, using the GeoDetector method, a spatially-based statistical technique, we assessed the individual and interactive influences of natural factors and human activities on vegetation-NDVI change. The results show that the growing season average NDVI exhibited a fluctuating upward trend of 0.003 per year from 2000 to 2018. The areas with significant increases in NDVI (p < 0.05) accounted for 45.63% of the entire region, and they were mainly distributed in the eastern part of the Mu Us sandy land and the eastern areas of the Greater Khingan Range. The regions with a decline in the NDVI were mainly distributed in the central and western regions of the study area. The GeoDetector results revealed that both natural and human factors had significant impacts on changes in the NDVI (p < 0.001). Precipitation, livestock density, wind speed, and population density were the dominant factors affecting NDVI changes in the Inner Mongolian grasslands, explaining more than 15% of the variability, while the contributions of the two topography factors (terrain slope and slope aspect) were relatively low (less than 2%). Furthermore, NDVI changes responded to the changes in the level of specific influencing factors in a nonlinear way, and the interaction of two factors enhanced the effect of each singular factor. The interaction between precipitation and temperature was the highest among all factors, accounting for 39.3% of NDVI variations.

However, previous studies were less to test the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of on-road PM2.5 and its related factors at micro scale. To this end, collecting high resolution PM2.5 data by mobile monitoring along different roads in Guangzhou, China, this paper explored the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of the relationship between built environment and on-road PM2.5 during the morning (7-9 am) and evening (7-9 pm) rush hours.

In addition to mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB, 2773 data), oceanic island basalts (OIB, 1515 data) and arc basalts (AB, 1049 data) that have been used in the previous studies, the new data set includes continental basalts (CB, 1517 data) to densely cover the globe and examine the geographical distribution of the mantle heterogeneity. It is found that CB are heavily concentrated in the eastern hemisphere, while MORB, OIB and AB are broadly distributed in the eastern and western hemispheres evenly. Then the independent features hidden in the data have been extracted using the multivariate analysis ""Independent Component Analysis (ICA)"", which provide information concerning the overall structure of the data and its origin. As a result, three independent components (ICs), which are similar to those deduced in the previous studies on the oceanic and arc basalts, are identified and account for 99% of the sample variance. Of these, the two independent components (IC1 and IC2) span a compositional plane that concentrates most of the data (95%), and the third minor component (IC3) accounts for 4%. Therefore, the oceanic, arc and continental basalts mostly plot on the same plane. The geochemical nature and the statistical properties (mean, standard deviation and skewness) of the ICs suggest that IC1 is related to variability of a long-term 'melt component' inherited in the mantle, whereas IC2 corresponds to a long-term 'aqueous fluid component' in the mantle. Numerical models for a differentiation-recycling system explain most of the statistical features of IC1 and IC2, which have likely been produced by melting and aqueous fluid-rock interactions in ridge, plume and subduction zone. Material recycling and multiple processing in these tectonic settings allow IC1 and IC2 to overlap and create a joint distribution (i.e., the major compositional plane). On the other hand, IC3 exhibits unique features (e.g., a large positive skewness), suggesting that it represents minor and incomplete mixing of continental components from outside the mantle recycling system. In addition, IC2 shows global geographical discrimination, irrespective of the type of basalts, indicating the presence of east-west geochemical hemispheres in the mantle. We have also found a striking geometrical similarity between the IC2 hemispheres and the inner core hemispheric structure: the eastern hemisphere shows positive IC2 in the mantle and high seismic velocities in the inner core. Combining these constraints, we propose top-down hemispherical dynamics involving both the mantle and the core: focused subduction towards the supercontinents has formed a fluid component-rich hemispheric domain that seems to have been anchored to the asthenosphere during the continental dispersal in the past several hundred million years, and may affect the temperature and growth rate of the inner core, resulting in the synchronized hemispherical structures in the mantle and the core.

However, these methods require a large number of cells, which prevents their use for the special form infecting humans. DNA sequence analysis of genomic regions is useful to study P. carinii diversity, both at the evolutionary and epidemiological levels. To type the special form specific to humans, several methods are currently used to detect polymorphism in PCR products of polymorphic regions of the genome: DNA sequencing, type-specific hybridisations, and single-strand conformation polymorphism. All these methods still need evaluation. The frequency of potential co-infections in humans determined by these various methods is different. The differences could be due to methodological problems or to real variations between patient populations, geographical locations and/or prophylaxis regimens.

Moreover, the copula joint functions of characteristics and dominant factors of agricultural droughts were constructed.

In Subregion II, the climate tendency rate of droughts in different seasons has no significant change. Through geographical detection, the single factor detection illustrates that temperature and Precipitation Conversion Efficiency (PCE) show the highest explanatory power in different subregions. The interactive detection also demonstrates the explanatory powers of the combination of the PCE and temperature, respectively.

Nevertheless, previous evaluations of environmental policies regarding urban PM2.5 concentrations have rarely taken into account the influence of the natural geographical environment. Utilizing panel data and DID models for 266 prefecture-level cities in China from 2006 to 2019, this study thoroughly examines the impact of geographical environment on the China's Carbon Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) in reducing urban PM2.5 concentrations. The results suggest that (1) Neglecting the impact of natural geographical environment, although the ETS effectively reduces the PM2.5 concentration in the pilot cities from an overall perspective, there are anomalies in the robustness test and the heterogeneity analysis, which are mainly reflected in the decrease in the significance of the PSM-DID results, and the positive haze-enhancement effect of the ETSs of Fujian, Beijing, Shanghai, etc. (2) Considering the influence of geographic environment, combined with the spatial correlation between China's topographic distribution and PM2.5 concentration, four control groups of Basin, Coastal, etc. are screened for group regression, and the results show that geographic environment factors significantly affect the emission reduction effect of each ETS on PM2.5 concentration. (3) The regression results of the three types of spatial econometric models all indicate that there is a significant spatial spillover effect of ETS to reduce PM2.5 concentration. Considering the influence of geographic environment on the spatial spillover effect and the fact that China's provincial division is mostly based on geographic environment factors, in order to more reasonably assess the effect of the policy on the PM2.5 concentration, the researcher should select sample cities with no spatial correlation of PM2.5 and clustering robust standard errors to the provincial level.",China 's carbon emissions trading scheme,Urban PM2.5 concentrations,Geographical environment,Cluster robust standard errors,,"Su, Xianhong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We explore patterns and predictors of species richness across Africa in one such group, the palaeotropical genus Grewia L. (Malvaceae).Methods Grewia species richness was quantified by extracting herbarium records from GBIF and Tropicos and creating geographical grids at varying spatial scales. We assessed predictors of species richness using spatial regression models with 30 environmental variables. We explored species co-occurrence in Madagascar at finer resolutions using Schoener's index and compared species range sizes and International Union for Conservation of Nature status among ecoregions. Lastly, we derived a trait matrix for a subset of species found in Madagascar to characterize morphological diversity across space.Key Results Grewia species occur in 50 countries in Africa, with the highest number of species in Madagascar (93, with 80 species endemic). Species richness is highest in Madagascar, with <= 23 Grewia species in a grid cell, followed by coastal Tanzania/Kenya (<= 13 species) and northern South Africa and central Angola (11 species each). Across Africa, higher species richness was predicted by variables related to aridity. In Madagascar, a greater range in environmental variables best predicted species richness, consistent with geographical grid cells of highest species richness occurring near biome/ecoregion transitions. In Madagascar, we also observe increasing dissimilarity in species composition with increasing geographical distance.Conclusions The spatial patterns and underlying environmental predictors that we uncover in Grewia represent an important step in our understanding of plant distribution and diversity patterns across Africa. Madagascar boasts nearly twice the Grewia species richness of the second most species-rich country in Africa, which might be explained by complex topography and environmental conditions across small spatial scales.",Africa,co-occurrence,endemism,environmental heterogeneity,Grewia,,,,,,,Madagascar,,,Malvaceae,,morphological diversity,spatial diversity,,species richness,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to understand the spatial heterogeneity of stroke onset and residential environment influence scopes from multiscale. Methods: The 2013 to 2022 spatiotemporal distribution pattern of stroke onset was obtained via out-patient data from a hospital in Shanghai. Then nine residential environmental factors were selected to estimate the association of stroke onset by multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR), in three scenarios. Results: Accessibility to pubs/bars (PUB) and building density (BD) were the top two residential environmental factors both for the entire sample and by gender. Stress-related environmental factors have a greater impact on the onset of stroke in men but are limited in scope. The population of elderly people have relevance to environmental variables heterogeneity. The indicators relating to unhealthy food and alcohol suggest that habitinducing environmental factors have a limited impact on stroke onset, but rather that pre-existing habits play a greater role. Conclusions: MGWR analyses individual components across multiple bandwidths, revealing geographical disparities in the impact of elements that would otherwise be undetected on a global scale.

Potential causes include geographical differences, limited external validity (due to the focus on small-scale projects) and self-selection bias (due to not accounting for observed and unobserved heterogeneities) of some studies. Moreover, a large part of the literature on energy-gender nexus addresses between-gender instead of within-gender disparity, which is considered relevant because socio-economic characteristics do differ within a particular gender group. We address some of these concerns in the literature, using the endogenous switching regression (as identifying strategy) and the Rwanda national fifth Integrated Household Living Conditions Survey data of 2016/2017 to examine electricity adoption decision and impact of electrification on welfare outcomes in rural Rwanda. We find that having access to electricity impacts positively on equivalised consumption and labour force participation by 3.097 percent and 22 more days, respectively. We find significant positive transitional heterogeneity effects, suggesting that unobserved factors do inflate the estimated impacts.

The findings indicate that under different terrain conditions, there are significant differences in the decision-making of farmers concerning cultivated land use, leading to different land use efficiencies in different areas. Specifically, rural labour force transfer enhances land use efficiency in plain areas; however, it does not affect that in the low-hill areas. In addition, we found that in the plain areas, improving the quality of rural household labour can increase the cultivated land use efficiency, while in low-hill areas, enhancement of geographical accessibility is the key to improving land use efficiency.",cultivated land use,rural labour transfer,terrain heterogeneity,,,"Lu, Xinhai","Zhang, Lu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Knowledge of geographical variation in participation rates may help design targeted interventions to improve uptake. This study describes small-area and broad geographical patterns in bowel screening participation in Australia between 2015-2020. MethodsPublicly available population-level participation data for Australia's National Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP) were modelled using generalized linear models to quantify screening patterns by remoteness and area-level disadvantage. Bayesian spatial models were used to obtain smoothed estimates of participation across 2,247 small areas during 2019-2020 compared to the national average, and during 2015-2016 and 2017-2018 for comparison. Spatial heterogeneity was assessed using the maximized excess events test. ResultsOverall, screening participation rates was around 44% over the three time-periods. Participation was consistently lower in remote or disadvantaged areas, although heterogeneity was evident within these broad categories. There was strong evidence of spatial differences in participation over all three periods, with little change in patterns between time periods. If the spatial variation was reduced (so low participation areas were increased to the 80th centile), an extra 250,000 screens (4% of total) would have been conducted during 2019-2020. ConclusionsDespite having a well-structured evidence-based government funded national bowel cancer screening program, the substantial spatial variation in participation rates highlights the importance of accounting for the unique characteristics of specific geographical regions and their inhabitants.

Methods A total of 341 isolates from lesions of patients living in 11 provinces of Iran were grown in culture medium and inoculated to BALB/c mice to detect possible visceralisation. The species were identified by isoenzyme analysis using a battery of six enzymes and kinetoplast (k) DNA-PCR technique. Genetic variation among L. major isolates was analysed by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique. Results Of the total 341 isolates, 283 isolates were L. major and 58 isolates were Leishmania tropica. In rural areas, the causative agent of CL was mainly L. major (95%L. major vs. 5%L. tropica), in urban areas it was L. tropica (65%L. tropica vs. 35%L. major). All isolates of L. major and 8.6% of L. tropica isolates showed visceralisation in BALB/c mice.

However, the importance of links and the roles of neighbors of a node has been ignored if not all. To fill this gap, this article introduced the approach of weighted ego network analysis (WENA) to visualize the spatial heterogeneity of the maritime network at global and local levels. The topological connectivity graph of the global marine network was derived, and its structural properties were analyzed. It is found out that the values of the degree of ports follow power-law distribution, which indicates that the global marine network is scale-free, that is, there are few well-connected ports and a majority of less connected ports. The spatial disparities of the network can be described by a core-periphery pattern. In global, most of the hubs or ports with extremely high values of degree locate in the big-three maritime regions including Far East, North America, and West Europe. Along the peripheral belts of the three regions, there are lots of less connected small ports. A different hierarchical structure of six continents was captured by WENA. It is found that Europe, Asia, North America, and Africa showcase a pyramid-shaped hierarchical structure with a scale-free feature similar to the entire network, while South America and Oceania exhibit the fusiform hierarchy like small-world networks. It is proposed that such spatial inequality and heterogeneity were caused by the geographical environments such as the hub-and-spoke organization, the embedded trade pattern, and the proximity of location. These findings help us to understand the characteristics of the international trade pattern and shed light on the strategies of development for the industry stakeholders.",Global maritime network,spatial heterogeneity,hierarchical structure,weighted average centrality rank,weighted ego network analysis,"Zhang, Hong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sponge city construction has become an effective means to curb urban waterlogging. Although related studies have explored the comprehensive benefits of sponge cities, few studies have been conducted on the effects of different geographical environments on runoff control and suspended solid (SS) removal. Based on 76 cities with sponge cities in China, this study used the meta-analysis method to evaluate the relationships of climate, terrain, underlying surface conditions, and construction area with the increase in the total annual runoff control rate and SS removal rate. The results reveal that the runoff control benefit can be significantly improved by sponge cities under the combined conditions of average annual precipitation of approximately 1000 mm, high fractional vegetation cover, sufficient soil fertility, a terrain slope i of <= 2%, and a permeability coefficient of strata of 100-200 m/d, especially in northern China, where the weight representing the quantity of comprehensive benefits was calculated to be 25.5%. In addition, the study results assist in reforming unfavorable geographical environments in the construction of sponge city, thus providing more effective solutions for tackling SS pollution. The most significant benefits of SS removal were obtained in north central China, where the weight was 21.4%. This study comprehensively investigated the effects of geographical environmental factors on the comprehensive benefits of sponge city reflected by the improvement in the total annual runoff control rate and the SS removal rate.

Four measures of species richness were computed: total richness, and richness of the 18 most restricted species, 19 species of medium incidence (intermediate species) and 18 most widespread species. We used ordinary least-squares regression and spatial autoregressive modelling to test and estimate the richness-climate relationships.Results LGM climate constituted the best single set of explanatory variables for richness of restricted species, while modern climate and climatic heterogeneity was best for total and widespread species richness and richness of intermediate species, respectively. The autoregressive model with all climatic predictors was supported for all richness measures using an information-theoretic approach, albeit only weakly so for total species richness. Among the strongest relationships were increases in total and intermediate richness with climatic heterogeneity and in restricted richness with LGM growing-degree-days. Partial regression showed that climatic heterogeneity accounted for the largest unique variation fraction for intermediate richness, while LGM climate was particularly important for restricted richness.Main conclusions LGM climate appears to still affect geographical patterns of tree species richness in Europe, albeit the relative importance of modern and LGM climate depends on range size.

Patterns and determinants of species richness are well-known to vary with spatial scale. However, most studies on the effects of scale have focused on grain size whereas the quantitative effects of geographical extent are rarely tested. Here, using distribution maps of 11 405 woody species found in China and associated environmental data to the domain, we investigated the influence of geographical extent on the determinants of species richness patterns. Our results revealed consistent extent dependence of all species, narrow- and wide-ranged species: with the expansion of geographical extents, the explanatory power of climate (i.e. environmental energy, water availability and climatic seasonality) increased, while the explanatory power of habitat heterogeneity and human activities decreased. Although the primary determinant of species richness patterns varied significantly at small to meso-geographical extent, we showed that species richness was predominantly determined by environmental energy at large extent. Our findings indicate that differences in geographical extent may have led to the controversies regarding the primary determinants of richness patterns in previous studies, and that a multi-scale perspective not only with regard to grain-size but also extent is likely to shed new light on this old debate of what determines richness patterns.",,,,,,"Fang, Jingyun",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the southernmost population of A. nodosum in Europe and shows morphological and demographic traits that are different from those of populations from more central locations within its range of distribution.

Urbanisation of societies, associated with changes in diet, antibiotic use, hygiene status, microbial exposures and pollution have been implicated as potential environmental risk factors for IBD. Changes in socioeconomic status might occur differently in different geographical areas and populations and, consequently, it is important to consider the heterogeneity of risk factors applicable to the individual patient.

Studying on the geographical distribution pattern and predicting the potential geographical distribution of species are of great significance for developing scientific and effective biodiversity conservation strategies. Plenty of rare and endangered species that need immediate conservation are distributed in Northwest Yunnan. In this regard, this research is conducted in the purpose of predicting the potential geographical distribution of 25 rare and endangered plant species in Northwest Yunnan and analyzing the explanation capabilities of various environmental factors on the potential geographical distribution patterns of these species. Initially, the ecological niche model MaxEnt was employed to predict the potential geographical distribution of target species. Following that, the superposition method was applied to obtain the potential geographical distribution pattern of species richness on the spatial scale of the ecological niche model with a resolution of 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees. Ultimately, geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was adopted to investigate the explanation capabilities of various environmental parameters on the potential distribution patterns. The research results showed that the average value of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of each species was between 0.80 and 1.00, which indicated that the simulation accuracy of the MaxEnt model for each species was good or excellent. On the whole, the potential distribution area for each species was relatively concentrated and mainly distributed in the central-western, central-eastern and northern regions of Northwest Yunnan. In addition, the potential distribution areas of these species were between 826.33 km(2) and 44,963.53 km(2). In addition, the annual precipitation (Bio12), precipitation of coldest quarter (Bio19), and population density (Pop) made a greater contribution to the species distribution model, and their contribution values were 25.92%, 15.86%, and 17.95%, respectively. Moreover, the goodness-of-fit R-2 and AIC value of the water model were 0.88 and 7,703.82, respectively, which indicated the water factor largely influenced the potential distribution of these species. These results would contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the potential geographical distribution pattern and the distribution of suitable habitats of some rare and endangered plant species in Northwest Yunnan and would be helpful for implementing long-term conservation and reintroduction for these species.",biodiversity conservation,environmental explanations,geographically weighted regression,habitat suitability,MaxEnt,"Zhao, Xiao","Chen, Hui","Si, Qin","Wu, Jianyong",,,Northwest Yunnan,,,potential geographical distribution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study developed a full-track stochastic model to generate synthetic TCs based on historical TCs and climatology data in Northwest Pacific. A variable geographical sampling approach was proposed to capture the spatial heterogeneity as a function of the density of historical TC data. The track model is derived using the Cartesian coordinate system and considers the statistical characteristics of TC lysis to simulate the TCs better regardless of their heading direction. The effect of ocean feedback was included in the TC intensity model by the one-dimensional ocean model. The track and intensity models were then validated with the statistical characteristics of historical TCs. The TC wind hazards along the China coast were assessed. The main findings include: (1) the developed TC track and intensity model agree well with the historical data; (2) the accuracy of stochastic modeling of TCs is enhanced by including the spatial heterogeneity; (3) considering ocean feedback by one-dimensional ocean model arrives in better modeling of TC intensity.

This study addressed issues on the vulnerability of water resources and provided a multiscale comparison of spatial heterogeneity under a climate change background. Using improved quantitative evaluation methods of vulnerability, the Theil index and the Shannon-Weaver index, we evaluated the vulnerability of water resources and its spatial heterogeneity in the Haihe River Basin in four scales, namely, second-class water resource regions (Class II WRRs), third-class water resource regions (Class III WRRs), Province-Class II WRRs, and Province-Class III WRRs. Results show that vulnerability enhances from the north to south in the different scales, and shows obvious spatial heterogeneity instead of moving toward convergence in multiscale assessment results. Among the Class II WRRs, the Tuhai-Majia River is the most vulnerable area, and the vulnerability of the Luanhe River is lower than that of the north of the Haihe River Basin, which in turn is lower than that of the south of the Haihe River Basin. In the scales of Class III WRRs and Province-Class III WRRs, the vulnerability shows obvious spatial heterogeneity and diversity measured by the Theil index and the Shannon-Weaver index.

The theoretical frameworks and implementation of both approaches are discussed: GWR models calibrate multiple models whereas GAMs provide a full single model; GAMs can automatically penalise local collinearity; GWR-based approaches are computationally more demanding; MGWR is still only for Gaussian responses; MGWR bandwidths are intuitive indicators of spatial heterogeneity. GGP-GAM calibration and tuning are also discussed and areas of future work are identified, including the creation of a user-friendly package to support model creation and coefficient mapping, and to facilitate ease of comparison with alternate SVC models.

Given the fact that most existing models cannot comprehensively depict heterogeneities (e.g., the population heterogeneity and the distribution heterogeneity) and complex contagion patterns (which are mostly caused by the human interaction induced by modern transportation) in the real world, a theoretical model of the spread of infectious diseases is proposed. It employs geo-entity based cellular automata to simulate the spread of infectious diseases in a geographical environment. In the model, physical geographical regions are defined as cells. The population within each cell is divided into three classes: Susceptible, Infective, and Recovered, which are further divided into some subclasses by states of individuals. The transition rules, which determine the changes of proportions of those subclasses and reciprocal transformation formulas among them, are provided. Through defining suitable spatial weighting functions, the model is applied to simulate the spread of the infectious diseases with not only local contagion but also global contagion. With some cases of simulation, it has been shown that the results are reasonably consistent with the spread of infectious diseases in the real world. The model is supposed to model dynamics of infectious diseases on complex networks, which is nearly impossible to be achieved with differential equations because of the complexity of the problem. The cases of simulation also demonstrate that efforts of all kinds of interventions can be visualized and explored, and then the model is able to provide decision-making support for prevention and control of infectious diseases.",cellular automata,infectious disease,modeling,geographic information systems,spatial weighting function,Song DunJiang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cooperators' specific distribution contributes to an enhanced level of cooperation in the system compared with random one, and cooperation is robust to cooperators' specific distribution but fragile to defectors' specific distribution. Especially, unlike the specific case, increasing heterogeneity of network does not always favor the emergence of cooperation under random mechanism.

We investigated the land use/cover changes and drivers of those changes between 1990 and 2010 in the Austrian and Italian bi-national region of Tyrol. We focus on grasslands as they covered around 94% of the utilized agricultural area since 1990. We mapped changes in grassland areas and assessed the socio-economic and biophysical factors associated with those changes using statistical modelling. Both sub-regions of Tyrol experienced changes in grasslands, but national and local scale factors mediated the impact of regional integration on land use decisions. Marginal grasslands decreased more rapidly in Austria's than in Italy's Tyrol, mostly in high elevation areas. High-management intensity grasslands slightly expanded in Austrian Tyrol, while in Italy's South Tyrol their conversion to other land uses such as permanent crops was more frequent. In the whole Tyrol region, grasslands of high management intensity expanded mostly in municipalities with a larger population, greater livestock density, smaller farms, more remote location, and fewer municipal grasslands and natural parks. Our findings suggest that grasslands conversion is a geographically heterogeneous process. Notwithstanding the de-agrarisation of the Tyrolean landscapes that took place in some Alpine areas, an expansion of grasslands was observed in others.

This research addresses a critical gap in understanding the role of local spatial factors, which previous studies have often overlooked, focusing instead on macroeconomic variables. Design/methodology/approach - Using a data set of housing transactions of Metropolitan Tehran from 2010 to 2020 sourced from secondary data, this study uses generalized linear mixed models and spatial clustering techniques. These methods enable an examination of geographical clustering and the effects of local contextual variables on the dynamics between housing prices and transaction volumes. Findings - Results indicate significant spatial heterogeneity within Tehran's housing market. Higher prices and transaction volumes are concentrated in the northern and western regions, influenced by factors such as employment rates, rental housing supply and the physical attributes of the housing stock. The findings suggest that macroeconomic policies alone are insufficient to address housing challenges in Tehran; targeted, localized interventions are necessary. Research limitations/implications - This study's reliance on secondary data and its focus on a single urban environment may limit the generalizability of the findings. Further research incorporating a wider range of local and macro variables could strengthen the applicability of the results across different contexts. Practical implications - This study underscores the need for region-specific housing policies that consider local economic, social and spatial conditions. Policymakers could improve housing affordability and accessibility in Tehran by implementing tailored strategies to address the distinct needs of different districts. Originality/value - This study offers a novel perspective by integrating spatial and contextual factors in housing market analysis, providing insights that challenge the traditional macroeconomic focus.

The empirical analysis is based on a novel corruption dataset we developed on local corruption in China at various disaggregation levels. The empirical results using fixed effects and instrumental variable estimation methods suggest that corruption has an economically and statistically significant negative effect on firm productivity. The estimated economic cost of corruption is found to be high; a one standard deviation increase in corruption reduces firm TFP by around 3.8%. We also find that firm heterogeneity shapes business reactions to corruption in a given geographical location. Increasing corruption hurts firms less when they are publicly owned, export-oriented, more profitable, have faster growth, or operate in industries with lower levels of competition. We also show that firms in cities with higher levels of human capital and higher levels of public spending on education and scientific research are less sensitive to corruption. As for transmission channels, we find that corruption is likely to hurt TFP through its negative effects on private ownership, investment rate, export intensity, innovation, leverage, employment growth, and profit.Published by Elsevier Ltd.

(ii) Temperature has a dominant influence on the snow cover in all three regions, showing that net surface energy flux balance is the major limitation to the snow cover so that temperature becomes the key factor of snow-related risk management. (iii) The impact of precipitation on snow cover is only significant in the Qaidam areas according to the interaction detector approach, where the combination of temperature and precipitation can explain more than 65% of the snow cover distribution.

Using the Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration as research area, four landscape metrics were used to analyze landscape characteristics of urban expansion from 1990 to 2015. Spatial autocorrelation analysis was used to study the characteristics of built-up land expansion, while geographical detector was employed to identify the driving forces of urban land growth and their interactions. The results show the extent of built-up land has been increasing, the structure has become more complex, the level of fragmentation has been increasing, and the aggregation degree is in decline. The built-up landscape index shows spatial heterogeneity occurring in the core and peripheral towns of cities, as well as in the core and peripheral areas of the entire region. Also, changes in the built-up landscape index indicate increased spatial aggregation occurring in the past 25 years. Results from the geographical detector show natural, socio-economic, and transportation-related factors have substantial influence on built-up land expansion. Elevation, slope, population density, change in population density, and road network density were shown to have high influencing power. The influencing powers of slope and change in population density were also found to be different from other factors, highlighting their important role in urban development.

Midlands sites, with complex topography and nutrient-rich and deep soils, had higher soil arthropod diversity than sandy, shallow Zululand soils. Indigenous forest and grassland supported complementary arthropod assemblages. The responses of arthropod diversity and assemblage composition to local environmental variables varied greatly among biotopes, taxa, and regions, but responses were more pronounced in the Midlands than in Zululand, and arthropods were more responsive to site-and soil-related variables than to landscape variables. Lower soil biodiversity in Zululand compared to the Midlands emphasizes that management efforts to limit further homogenization from inappropriate management is particularly important in this sandy region. Lack of common drivers of soil arthropod diversity suggests that conservation strategies need to be tailored to different locations.

This helps to mitigate the impact of sample selection and assumptions about spatial stationarity on simulation results. The performance of GOS-SSN-CA simulation was tested by taking the urban expansion in the Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan urban agglomeration in China as an example. The results show that GOS can derive more accurate and reliable urban transition rules with fewer samples, thereby significantly reducing spatial prediction errors compared with logistic regression. Moreover, SSN selects different neighborhood sizes to represent the difference between the local self-organizing range and surrounding cells, thus further improving the simulation accuracy and restricting urban expansion morphology. Overall, GOS-SSN-CA effectively characterizes the geographical similarity of urban expansion, improves simulation accuracy while constraining the urban expansion form, and enhances the practical application value of CA.",urban growth,cellular automata,geographic similarity,model optimization,spatial nonstationarity,"Zhou, Zhou","Ren, Hui","Tan, Xuelan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identifying the determinants of residents' travel-related CO2 emissions (TCE) from a spatial perspective is significant for formulating effective carbon reduction strategies. However, limited research explores the spatial heterogeneous relationship between TCE and its determinants. In this study, we focus on Guiyang, China, as a representative city and adopt Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZ) as geospatial units of analysis to capture regional differences in CO2 emissions. By analyzing data from the 2021 Guiyang resident travel survey, we measure per capita CO2 emissions and reveal that in Guiyang, each person emits 599.42 g of CO2 during their travels. Furthermore, we apply a semiparametric geographically weighted regression model to investigate the spatial nonstationarity of the variables' impact on TCE. Our findings reveal that local variables have heterogeneous effects on TCE across different TAZs. For example, while the Huaxi district in southern Guiyang shows a negative correlation between TCE and the proportion of low-income individuals, most regions in Guiyang exhibit the opposite trend with a positive correlation. In the northern regions of Guiyang, such as Kaiyang and Xifeng, the proportion of car ownership negatively impacts TCE, contrasting with conclusions drawn from other regions. Moreover, the results of geographical variation tests indicate that sociodemographic attributes exhibit greater spatial heterogeneity in their influence on TCE, in contrast to built environment attributes.

This study takes the Beibu Gulf urban agglomeration, a national-level model area for integrated land and sea development in China, as an example to investigate the spatial heterogeneity of CLIU and explore its driving factors through multiple econometrical and geographical methods, including identifying its underlying mechanisms. The results indicate that (1) the CLIU index is 0.334, its Gini coefficient is 0.183, and its comprehensive level has a low intensity and obvious spatial nonequilibrium characteristics. Hypervariable density (50.33%) and the intraprovincial gap (45.6%) are the main sources. (2) Among the independent effects of single factors, the multiple cropping index (0.57), labor force index (0.489), and intensification of construction land (0.375) exert the most influence on CLIU spatial variation. The interaction effects of two factors primarily manifested as nonlinear enhancements, with the interaction between the labor force index and multiple cropping index being particularly noteworthy (0.859). (3) The geographically weighted regression coefficients reveal that temperature (0.332), multiple cropping index (0.211), and labor force index (0.209) have relatively large and positive impacts on CLIU, while slope (-0.1), precipitation (-0.087), and population urbanization (-0.039) have relatively small and negative impacts; all factors exhibit spatial nonstationarity. The spatial heterogeneity of CLIU in the Beibu Gulf urban agglomeration is characterized by patterns' nonequilibrium and factors' nonstationarity. The driving mode of multiple factors on CLIU is manifested as follows: natural factors of cropland utilization provide basic guarantees, internal factors of CLIU provide positive enhancement, and external factors of land intensive utilization provide auxiliary promotion.",,,,,,"Zhang, X",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our OLS results suggest that income, population density, commercial land use and Saudi population characteristics are statistically significant for Type-2 diabetes prevalence. However, by the GWR model, income, commercial land use and Saudi population characteristics were significantly positive while population density was significantly negative in this model for 70.6%, 9.1%, 26.6% and 58.7%, respectively, out of 109 districts investigated; by the MGWR model, the corresponding results were 100%, 22%, 100% and 100% of the districts. With the given data, the corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc), the adjusted R2, the log-likelihood and the residual sum of squares (RSS) indices demonstrated that the MGWR model outperformed the GWR and OLS models explaining 29% more variance than the OLS model, and 10.2% more than the GWR model.

It has been shown through analysis and simulation that it is impossible to guarantee uniform energy depletion of all the sensors in static uniformly distributed always-on WSNs with constant data reporting to the sink when the sensors use their nominal communication range to transmit data to the sink. We prove that the energy sink-hole problem can be solved provided that the sensors adjust their communication ranges. This solution, however, imposes a severe restriction on the size of a sensor field. To overcome this limitation, we propose a sensor deployment strategy based on energy heterogeneity with a goal that all the sensors deplete their energy at the same time. Simulation results show that such a deployment strategy helps achieve this goal. To solve the energy sink-hole problem for homogeneous WSNs, we propose a localized energy-aware-Voronoi-diagram-based data forwarding ( EVEN) protocol. EVEN combines sink mobility with a new concept, called energy-aware Voronoi diagram. Through simulations, we show that EVEN outperforms similar greedy geographical data forwarding protocols and has performance that is comparable to that of an existing data collection protocol that uses a joint mobility and routing strategy. Precisely, we find that EVEN yields an improvement of more than 430 percent in terms of network lifetime.",wireless sensor networks,energy sink-hole problem,energy heterogeneity,sink mobility,energy-aware Voronoi diagram,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, surveillance data of HFMD cases for patients 15 years of age or younger in east Mainland China between 2009 and 2015 was retrieved from the national surveillance system, and then an age and gender-stratified spatiotemporal Bayesian hierarchical model was built with three types of transmission hazards (intra-area transmission, inter-area transmission, and environmental risk factors). Spatial and temporal heterogeneities of HFMD transmission were quantified by the contribution of the hazard components over time and regions. In addition, the transmission heterogeneity by age-gender subgroups was determined by the transmission probabilities derived from the transmission rate matrix. We found that the intra-area transmission hazard dominated HFMD transmission (56.4% to 96.3%), followed by environmental risk factors (1.1% to 42.1%), whereas the contribution of the inter-area transmission hazard component was relatively small (1.5% to 3.6%). During school holidays, the contribution of the inter-area transmission component caused an instantaneous increase in the overall transmission hazard. In addition, the cumulative hazard contribution across time varied with the geographic region, and three distinct clusters were identified and related with the size of the local population. Moreover, the transmission probability was the highest among the same age-gender group within the intra-area transmission hazard, whereas inter-area and environmental transmission hazards had stronger effects among older children. HFMD transmission varied significantly over time, geographical regions, and age-gender subgroups. Development of targeted and individualized precise policies of HFMD control can benefit from illuminating its spatiotemporal transmission heterogeneity and consideration of the characteristics of population at risk.

Conventional quantitative methods for determining these associations primarily involve correlating various geochemical elements with ore-forming elements and mineral deposits. However, these approaches often face challenges in elucidating the complex interrelationships among geochemical elements and are less effective in regions without known mineral deposits. The geographical detector has emerged as a powerful tool for detecting spatial heterogeneity and identifying key driving factors in mineralization processes. Since geochemical elements are regional variables characterized by spatial heterogeneity, the geographical detector is particularly suited for analyzing interactions among these elements. Additionally, unsupervised machine learning algorithms have proven adept at managing complex interrelations among geochemical elements and extracting deeper insights into mineralization patterns. Despite their advantages, these algorithms carry inherent systematic errors, which introduce uncertainties when relying on a single method, thereby increasing exploration risks. This study applies the geographical detector to the Nanling metallogenic belt, one of the most significant tungsten (W) polymetallic metallogenic belt in South China, to investigate the complex relationships between the ore-forming element W and other geochemical elements, as well as to identify associations pertinent to W polymetallic mineralization. Furthermore, 3 widely used unsupervised learning algorithms, including one-class support vector machines (OCSVM), isolation forest (IF), and deep auto-encoder neural networks (DAE), are employed to detect geochemical anomalies. A model averaging strategy is implemented to calculate the average and standard deviation of geochemical anomaly scores, providing robust anomaly predictions and the quantifying uncertainties associated with systematic errors across different algorithms. The enhanced prediction-area (P-A) plot is used to further assess these anomalies and their uncertainties. Key results include: (1) Geochemical elements such as Sn, Mo, Ag, and Bi have the largest impact on the enrichment of W, followed by Cu, Pb, and Be, with these elements often found in co-occurring or associated minerals linked to W polymetallic mineralization. Additional elements, including Nb, Th, Al2O3, U, As, F, Y, Cd, and Li, also contribute to W enrichment, reflecting the geochemical characteristics of plutons associated with W polymetallic deposits; (2) Element interactions are complex, with most showing nonlinear enhancement effects on W enrichment, which is critical for large-scale W mineralization in the region; (3) Among the machine learning algorithms, IF and OCSVM demonstrate superior and relatively stable performance, whereas DAE exhibits more scattered and disorganized anomaly detection, possibly due to limitation in the pixel-based anomaly recognition; (4) 6 prospective areas for mineral exploration have been identified based on geochemical anomaly scores and their associated uncertainties. This study not only introduces a novel methodology for quantitatively analyzing the complex relationships among geochemical elements, selecting relavant geochemical associations, and elucidating key geological processes related to mineralization.

Variable-selection methods were applied to select important predictors for each mosquito species and malaria incidence.The proposed joint model led to a general reduction of the variance in the estimates compared to independent modelling. There was high variability in the composition of Anopheles mosquito species in the villages with each species suitability only partly overlapping geographically. Abundances of An. gambiae, An. funestus and An. nili were primarily determined by temperature. None of the species were found as a significant predictor for the others. Anopheles gambiae was the predominant species and only An. gambiae female abundance was an important variable (linear predictor) for malaria incidence. However, the geographic correlation analyses show that the rest of Anopheles species are likely playing a role in malaria suitability.Residuals from the models of mosquito abundance and malaria cases are also correlated with each other and overlapping but in geographic patches, meaning that local drivers of vector-malaria suitability are still present and not represented by the predictors used in the model.Synthesis and applications: Joint modelling improve predictive estimation compared to individual modelling. The accurate predictions highlighted high diversity in the association between malaria and vector species, with most of the area having more than one species suitability correlated with malaria suitability. These zones are unlikely to benefit from species-specific interventions. Areas with correlated malaria and vector species suitability residuals contain local information, not included in the model, that requires further investigation.

Despite the significance of this knowledge, a comprehensive quantification of the influence of regional topographical and geological factors on the spatial heterogeneity of debris-flow-prone areas has been lacking. This study selected the Hengduan Mountains, an earthquake-prone region characterized by diverse surface conditions and complex landforms, as a representative study area. An improved units zoning and objective factors identification methodology was employed in earthquake and fault analysis to assess the impact of seismic activity and geological factors on spatial heterogeneity of debris-flow prone areas. Results showed that the application of GIS technology with hydrodynamic intensity and geographical units analysis can effectively analyze debris-flow prone areas. Meanwhile, earthquake and fault zones obviously increase the density of debris-flow prone catchments and make them unevenly distributed.

These data types have different spatial characteristics. We investigated whether these differences influence conclusions regarding postulated determinants of species richness patterns.Location Our study examined terrestrial bird diversity patterns in 13 nations of southern and eastern Africa, spanning temperate to tropical climates.Methods Four species richness maps were compiled based on range maps, field-derived bird atlas data, logistic and autologistic distribution models. Ordinary and spatial regression models served to examine how well each of five hypotheses predicted patterns in each map. These hypotheses propose productivity, temperature, the heat-water balance, habitat heterogeneity and climatic stability as the predominant determinants of species richness.Results The four richness maps portrayed broadly similar geographical patterns but, due to the nature of underlying data types, exhibited marked differences in spatial autocorrelation structure. These differences in spatial structure emerged as important in determining which hypothesis appeared most capable of explaining each map's patterns. This was true even when regressions accounted for spurious effects of spatial autocorrelation. Each richness map, therefore, identified a different hypothesis as the most likely cause of broad-scale gradients in species diversity.Main conclusions Because the 'true' spatial structure of species richness patterns remains elusive, firm conclusions regarding their underlying environmental drivers remain difficult. More broadly, our findings suggest that care should be taken to interpret putative determinants of large-scale ecological gradients in light of the type and spatial characteristics of the underlying data.

In 2019, we reported low rates of TAVI in the UK compared with other countries in western Europe and highlighted profound geographical variation in TAVI care. Here, we provide contemporary data on access to aortic valve replacement by either TAVI or SAVR across clinical commissioning groups in England. Methods: We obtained aggregated data from the UK TAVI registry and the National Adult Cardiac Surgery Audit between 2019 and 2023. Rates of TAVI and SAVR procedures per million population were reported by clinical commissioning groups. The relationship between TAVI and SAVR rates was determined using Pearson correlation coefficients. Results: In 2022/23, the rates of TAVI and SAVR in England were 136 per million population and 60 per million population, respectively. The observed increase in TAVI rates since 2019/20 corresponded with a decline in SAVR rates. There remains substantial variation in access to both procedures, with an over tenfold variation in TAVI rates, and an over fourfold variation in SAVR rates across clinical commissioning groups in England. No relationship was identified between the rates of TAVI and those for SAVR (correlation coefficient 0.06).

Recently, its distribution widened, threatening Europe. The probability of the introduction and large-scale spread of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) in Europe is low, but localized RVF outbreaks may occur in areas where populations of ruminants and potential vectors are present. In this study, we assumed the introduction of the virus into Italy and focused on the risk of vector-borne transmission of RVFV to three main European potential hosts (cattle, sheep and goats). Five main potential mosquito vectors belonging to the Culex and Aedes genera that are present in Italy were identified in a literature review. We first modelled the geographical distribution of these five species based on expert knowledge and using land cover as a proxy of mosquito presence. The mosquito distribution maps were compared with field mosquito collections from Italy to validate the model. Next, the risk of RVFV transmission was modelled using a multicriteria evaluation (MCE) approach, integrating expert knowledge and the results of a literature review on host sensitivity and vector competence, feeding behaviour and abundance. A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the results with respect to expert choices. The resulting maps include (i) five maps of the vector distribution, (ii) a map of suitable areas for vector-borne transmission of RVFV and (iii) a map of the risk of RVFV vector-borne transmission to sensitive hosts given a viral introduction. Good agreement was found between the modelled presence probability and the observed presence or absence of each vector species.

Forests (q = 0.620), slopes (q = 0.616), elevation (q = 0.579), grasslands (q = 0.534), and artificial surfaces (q = 0.506) are the main individual factors affecting AOD distribution. Among them, natural factors such as topography, ecological space, and wind speed are negatively correlated with AOD values, whereas the opposite is true for human factors such as roads, artificial surfaces, and population. Each factor can barely affect the air pollution status significantly alone, and the explanatory power of all influencing factors showed an improvement through the two-factor enhanced interaction. The associations of elevation boolean AND artificial surface (q = 0.625), elevation boolean AND NDVI (q = 0.622), and elevation boolean AND grassland (q = 0.620) exhibited a high explanatory power on AOD value distribution, suggesting that the combination of multiple factors such as low altitude, high building density, and sparse vegetation can lead to higher AOD values. These results are conducive to the understanding of the air pollution status and its influencing factors, and in future, decision makers should adopt different strategies, as follows: (1) high-density built-up areas should be considered as the key areas of pollution control, and (2) a single-factor pollution control strategy should be avoided, and a multi-factor synergistic optimization strategy should be adopted to take full advantage of the interaction among the factors to address the air pollution problem more effectively.",air pollution,spatial heterogeneity,Geodetector,influencing factors,Shijiazhuang City,"Namaiti, Aihemaiti",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, spatiotemporal variability in these communities over large geographical scale remains understudied. We investigated sediment bacterial communities and their metabolic potential in an intertidal mangrove forest of India, Bhitarkanika, using high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and community-level physiological profiling. Bulk surface sediments from five different locations representing riverine and bay sites were collected over three seasons. Seasonality largely explained the variation in the structural and metabolic patterns of the sediment bacterial communities. Freshwater Actinobacteria were more abundant in monsoon, whereas -Proteobacteria demonstrated higher abundance in summer. Distinct differences in the bacterial community composition were noted between riverine and bay sites. For example, salt-loving marine bacteria affiliated to Oceanospirillales were more prominent in the bay sites than the riverine sites. l-asparagine, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, and d-mannitol were the preferentially utilized carbon sources by bacterial communities. Bacterial community composition was largely governed by salinity and organic carbon content of the sediments. Modeling analysis revealed that the abundance of -Proteobacteria increased with salinity, whereas -Proteobacteria displayed an opposite trend. Metabolic mapping of taxonomic data predicted biogeochemical functions such as xylan and chitin degradation, ammonia oxidation, nitrite reduction, and sulfate reduction in the bacterial communities suggesting their role in carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycling in mangrove sediments. This study has provided valuable clues about spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the structural and metabolic patterns of bacterial communities and their environmental determinants in a tropical mangrove forest.",Mangrove forest,Bhitarkanika,Bacterial communities,Spatiotemporal heterogeneity,,"Kim, Ji Yoon","Adhya, Tapan K.","Pattnaik, Ajit K.","Rastogi, Gurdeep",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These findings refute the traditional image of the early modern peasant society as static. Still, there were people who never moved, and lived their whole lives where they were born. By asking questions about who moved and who did not, we are able to shed new light on living conditions and the social community in early modern peasant society.Using two unique visitation registers as well as other sources from late seventeenth-century Vastmanland, we have analysed the mobility of men, women, and children from different social strata. We find that in the parish Bjorskog, in the fertile lowlands of the Malaren valley in central Sweden, most people did not live where they had been born, and in the parish Gunnilbo, a rural society dominated by the mining industry, half the population had moved on to a new area within a five-year period. Thus, there were more people looking out for new places to live than there were people who never moved.An important finding from our study is that geographical mobility varied with social status and land rights. Access to land and other earning opportunities was decisive in determining people's behaviour. Depending on social class, gender, and age, these factors varied significantly, and with them geographical mobility. While the pattern of sons inheriting farms from their fathers may have been true of certain propertied and perhaps more influential and visible peasants, early modern peasant society was far more varied than this.

Interspecies transmission of BDV between sheep, cattle, and pigs occurs regularly, sometimes making diagnosis a challenge. BDV can yield substantial economic losses, including prenatal and postnatal infections in lambs, which are the primary source of infection and maintenance of the virus in the population. Since BDV is antigenically and genetically related to bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), it might pose a significant risk to cattle, influencing BVDV eradication campaigns. Similarly, the presence of BDV in swine herds due to pestivirus spillover between small ruminants and pigs might cause uncertainty in classical swine fever virus (CSFV) diagnostics.

This study aimed to determine whether treatment effects from different geographical recruitment regions impacted significantly on five-year MACCE rates in the SYNTAX trial.Methods and results: Five-year SYNTAX results (n= 1,800) were analysed for geographical variability by site and country for the effect of treatment (CABG vs. PCI) on MACCE rates. Fixed, random, and linear mixed models were used to test clinical covariate effects, such as diabetes, lesion characteristics, and procedural factors. Comparing five-year MACCE rates, the pooled odds ratio (OR) between study sites was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.47-0.71), and countries 0.59 (95% CI: 0.45-0.73). By homogeneity testing, no individual site (X-2= 93.8, p= 0.051) or country differences (X-2= 25.7, p= 0.080) were observed. For random effects models, the intraclass correlation was minimal (ICC site= 5.1%, ICC country= 1.5%, p< 0.001), indicating minimal geographical heterogeneity, with a hazard ratio of 0.70 (95% CI: 0.59-0.83).

Like all cancers, prostate cancer is a genetic disease that is characterized by multiple genomic alterations, including point mutations, microsatellite variations, and chromosomal alterations such as translocations, insertions, duplications, and deletions. In prostate cancer, but not other carcinomas, these chromosome alterations result in a high frequency of gene fusion events. The development and application of novel high-resolution technologies has significantly accelerated the detection of genomic alterations, revealing the complex nature and heterogeneity of the disease. The clinical heterogeneity of prostate cancer can be partly explained by this underlying genetic heterogeneity, which has been observed between patients from different geographical and ethnic populations, different individuals within these populations, different tumour foci within the same patient, and different cells within the same tumour focus. The highly heterogeneous nature of prostate cancer provides a real challenge for clinical disease management and a detailed understanding of the genetic alterations in all cells, including small subpopulations, would be highly advantageous.",,,,,,"Lu, Yong-Jie",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that plant populations may escape extinction because of both spatial range and ecological niche shifts. Exact analytical formulas predict that increasing pollen dispersal distance slows the expected spatial range shift and accelerates the ecological niche shift. There is an optimal distance of pollen dispersal, which maximizes the sustainable rate of climate change. These conclusions hold in simulations relaxing several strong assumptions of our analytical model.

Methods: We performed a retrospective observational study in four Italian regions, including all resident subjects aged 5-69 years, and undergoing first dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in the period 28th December 2020- 3rd April 2022. We estimated cumulative coverage percentages, by age class and geographical area. To compare first-dose vaccine coverage by geographical area of origin, we estimated, through a Poisson analysis, Vaccine Coverage Ratios (VCR) with 95 % confidence intervals (95 %CI), adjusting for age and sex. Results: We included 16,294,785 Italian citizens and 2,534,351 immigrants aged 5-69 years and resident in the four regions considered.

Targeting indoor residual spraying (IRS) to areas where cases have been detected is one strategy currently under investigation in northeastern South Africa. This seroprevalence baseline study, nested within a targeted IRS trial, was undertaken to provide insights into malaria transmission dynamics in South Africa and evaluate whether sero-epidemiological practices have the potential to be routinely incorporated into elimination programmes.Methods: Filter-paper blood spots, demographic and household survey data were collected from 2710 randomly selected households in 56 study wards located in the municipalities of Ba-Phalaborwa and Bushbuckridge. Blood spots were assayed for Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen-1 and merozoite surface protein-1(19) blood-stage antigens using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Seroprevalence data were analysed using a reverse catalytic model to determine malaria seroconversion rates (SCR). Geospatial cluster analysis was used to investigate transmission heterogeneity while random effects logistic regression identified risk factors associated with malaria exposure.Results: The overall SCR across the entire study site was 0.012 (95% CI 0.008-0.017) per year. Contrasting SCRs, corresponding to distinct geographical regions across the study site, ranging from <0.001 (95% CI <0.001-0.005) to 0.022 (95% CI 0.008-0.062) per annum revealed prominent transmission heterogeneity. Geospatial cluster analysis of household seroprevalence and age-adjusted antibody responses detected statistically significant (p < 0.05) spatial clusters of P. falciparum exposure. Formal secondary education was associated with lower malaria exposure in the sampled population (AOR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56-0.95, p = 0.018).Conclusions: Although overall transmission intensity and exposure to malaria was low across both study sites, malaria transmission intensity was highly heterogeneous and associated with low socio-economic status in the region.

The method consists of using the geographical coordinates of a region, based on eigenanalyses of geographical distances, to establish a set of spatial filters (eigenvectors) expressing the spatial structure of the region at different spatial scales. These filters can then be used as predictors in multiple and partial regression analyses, taking into account spatial autocorrelation. Autocorrelation in filters and in the regression residuals can be used as stopping rules to define which filters will be used in the analyses.Results Environmental component alone explained 8% of variation in richness, whereas 77% of the variation could be attributed to an interaction between environment and geography expressed by the filters (which include mainly broad-scale climatic factors). Regression coefficients of environmental component were highest for AET. These results were unbiased by short-scale spatial autocorrelation. Also, there was a significant interaction between topographic heterogeneity and minimum temperature.Conclusion Eigenvector-based spatial filtering is a simple and suitable statistical protocol that can be used to analyse patterns in species richness taking into account spatial autocorrelation at different spatial scales. The results for South American birds are consistent with the climatic hypothesis, in general, and energy hypothesis, in particular.

Water resource spatial equilibrium (WRSE) is an important yardstick for guiding regional water resource planning and sustainable utilization. However, research on the spatiotemporal heterogeneity and driving factors of WRSE is extremely lacking, and few existing studies have considered drought and flood disasters as the important reflection of WRSE. Therefore, this paper proposes a systematic integrated model for WRSE including regional evaluation, spatiotemporal heterogeneity and geodetector analysis functions, and constructs the evaluation index system considering droughts and floods. First, the performance of WRSE is quantified using the general deprivation index (GDI) innovatively. Then, combined with the Moran's I, the spatial patterns and regional differences of WRSE are analyzed. Last, the geographical detector models are employed to perform driving analysis of WRSE. The effectiveness of the model is verified in China. Results show that (1) from 2009 to 2021, the national average of WRSEI exhibits a declining trend from 0.879 in 2009 to 0.789 in 2021. (2) The areas with high WRSEI values are mainly distributed in the western provinces, whereas the eastern region has a higher percentage of imbalanced provinces.

From the numerical experiments, we find that the high strain rates can be reproduced by viscosity heterogeneities either in the crust or the mantle. If viscosity heterogeneity in the crust is an origin, the conditions to be satisfied are (i) an effective elastic thickness of 5 km for short-term loading (10(2)-10(3) yr), (ii) a low viscosity (< 1019 Pa s) in the lower crust beneath the zone, with a normal Viscosity (> 10(21) Pa s) in the ambient lower crust, and (iii) a uniform viscosity of 1019 Pa s in the upper mantle. On the other hand, if viscosity heterogeneity in the mantle is an origin, the conditions to be satisfied are (i) an effective elastic thickness of similar to 30 km for short-term loading, (ii) a low viscosity (similar to 10(18) Pa s) at least down to a depth of 60 km in the zone and to a depth of 10 km further seaward below the Moho depth, and (iii) a Viscosity of 1020 Pa s in the ambient mantle. The crust heterogeneity model contradicts the 15-km cut-off depth of intraplate seismicity and the similar to 20-km effective elastic thickness previously inferred from gravity and topography in central Honshu. The fact that Quaternary active faults and intraplate earthquakes are not particularly concentrated in the zone also favours the mantle viscosity heterogeneity model. Thus, we prefer the mantle heterogeneity model. We suggest that upward movement of water dehydrated from the subducting Philippine Sea and Pacific plates, partial melting of the mantle above the Pacific plate, and serpentinization in the wedge mantle above the Philippine Sea plate are possible origins of the low viscous upper mantle. Possible low viscosities in the upper mantle wedge presented in this study seem to provide important constraints for subduction processes of oceanic plates and strain accumulation processes in the upper plate.

Woodland proportion is crucial in reducing the quality and concentration of at-mospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and improving the atmospheric environment. Existing studies have mostly examined the connection between the woodland proportion and PM2.5 on a global scale, while ignoring the geographical variability and differences in the scope and intensity of the effect. Therefore, this study investigated the regional features of the effect from the perspective of spatial heterogeneity, using a spatial agglomeration analysis method, and global and local regression analyses models with 1049 counties in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB). The studies reveal that woodland proportion has a considerable impact on PM2.5, and the effect's direction is identical to that of the expectation at the global scale. The PM2.5 concentration falls by 0.017% for every 1% increase in the woodland proportion. The influence of woodland proportion on PM2.5 showed noticeable spatial heterogeneity, and the woodland proportion in 794 counties is strongly asso-ciated with PM2.5 concentration in local areas, with 66.44% of counties having the most obvious negative effect, and the areas with the greatest effect intensity are mostly distributed in mountainous areas.

The distance coefficients of reasonable and existing landscape indexes of farmland shelterbelt networks were computed, and then through the classification of the distance coefficients, and the establishment of evaluation rules, the spatial heterogeneity of farmland shelterbelts was evaluated. The method can improve the evaluating system of previous studies on shelterbelts distribution, resolve the disadvantages of lacking spatiality of overall evaluation, and make the evaluation results have more directive significance for shelterbelt management. Based on this method, spatial heterogeneity of shelterbelt networks was evaluated in the midwest of Jilin Province, China. The results show that the regions with fewer shelterbelts and no closed network account for 34.7% of the total area, but only 4.9% of the area has relative reasonable pattern of shelterbelt networks.

A positive interspecific relationship between abundance and distribution is widely considered to be one of the most general patterns in ecology. However, the relationship appears to vary considerably across assemblages, from significant positive to significant negative correlations and all shades in between.2. This variation has led to the suggestion that the abundance-distribution relationship has multiple forms, with the corollary that different patterns may inform about, or have different, causes. However, this variation has never been formally quantified, nor has it been determined whether the observed variation is indicative of sampling error in estimating a single effect or of real heterogeneity in such relationships. Here, we use the meta-analytical approach to assess variation in abundance-distribution relationships, and to test different hypotheses for it.3. Analysis of 279 relationships found a mean effect size of 0.655, which was both highly significantly different from zero and indicative of a strong positive association between abundance and distribution. However, effect sizes were highly heterogeneous, supporting the contention that this relationship does indeed have multiple forms.4. Most notably, relationships vary significantly in strength across realms, with the strongest in the marine and intertidal, intermediate relationships for terrestrial and parasitic assemblages, and the weakest relationships in freshwater systems. Effect sizes in all of the aquatic realms are homogeneous, suggesting that realm is an important source of the heterogeneity observed across all studies. We posit that this may be because the different spatial structure of the environment in each realm affects the opportunity for the dispersal of individuals between sites.5. Some of the remaining heterogeneity in effect sizes for terrestrial assemblages could be explained by partitioning assemblages by habitat, scale, biogeographical region and taxon, but considerable heterogeneity in effect sizes for terrestrial and parasitic assemblages remained unexplained.",density,geographical range size,macroecology,meta-analysis,occupancy,"Gaston, Kevin J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on data from 285 prefecture-level (and above) Chinese cities in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020, this study uses spatial econometric models to examine how highway accessibility and railway accessibility influence the urban-rural income disparity and to identify their spatial heterogeneity. The result reveals that highway accessibility and railway accessibility have 'coreperiphery' ring-like circle structures. The urban-rural income disparity exhibits strong spatial clustering effects. Both highway accessibility and railway accessibility are negatively associated with urban-rural income disparity, and the former having a greater effect size. Moreover, there is a substitution effect between highway accessibility and railway accessibility in the whole sample. Furthermore, these associations differ in geographic regions. In the central region, highway accessibility is more important in reducing the urban-rural income disparity, but its effect is weakened with the increase of railway accessibility. In the western region, railway accessibility has a larger effect on narrowing the urban-rural income disparity, and this effect is strengthened by the increase of highway accessibility. We conclude that improving transportation accessibility is conducive to reducing the urban-rural income disparity but its effect is spatial heterogenetic.

PM2.5 is the primary air pollutant across China. PM2.5 mainly comes from human activities, and the natural environment and urban built environment affect its distribution and diffusion. In contrast to American and European cities, Chinese cities are much denser, and studies on the relationships between urban form and air quality in high-density Chinese cities are still limited. In this paper, we used the ordinary least square (OLS) and geographical weighted regression (GWR) models, selected an already high-density city, Shenzhen, as the study area, and explored the effects of the natural and built environments on air pollution. The results showed that temperature always had a positive influence on PM2.5 and wind speed had a varied impact on PM2.5 within the city. Based on the natural factors analysis, the paper found that an increase in the floor area ratio (FAR) and road density may have caused the increase in the PM2.5 concentration in the central city. In terms of land use mix, land use policies should be adopted separately in the central city and suburban areas. Finally, in terms of spatial heterogeneity, the GWR models achieved much better performances than the global multivariate regression models, with lower AICc and RMSE values and higher adjusted R-2 values, ultimately explaining 60% of the variance across different city areas. The results indicated that policies and interventions should be more targeted to improve the air environment and reduce personal exposure according to the spatial geographical context.",natural and built environment,PM2,5 concentrations,spatial heterogeneity,,"Jiang, Dumei","Jiang, Yulin","Lin, Yinzhi","Gong, Ziying",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dietary consumption of foods rich in vitamin A was low in Ethiopia. This study aimed to assess the spatial distribution and spatial determinants of dietary consumption of foods rich in vitamin A among children aged 6-23 months in Ethiopia.Methods Ethiopian 2016 demographic and health survey dataset using a total of 3055 children were used to conduct this study. The data were cleaned and weighed by STATA version 14.1 software and Microsoft Excel. Children who consumed foods rich in vitamin A (Egg, Meat, Vegetables, Green leafy vegetables, Fruits, Organ meat, and Fish) at least one food item in the last 24 hours were declared as good consumption. The Bernoulli model was fitted using Kuldorff's SaTScan version 9.6 software. ArcGIS version 10.7 software was used to visualize spatial distributions for poor consumption of foods rich in vitamin A. Geographical weighted regression analysis was employed using MGWR version 2.0 software. A P-value of less than 0.05 was used to declare statistically significant predictors spatially.Results Overall, 62% (95% CI: 60.56-64.00) of children aged 6-23 months had poor consumption of foods rich in vitamin A in Ethiopia. Poor consumption of foods rich in vitamin A highly clustered in Afar, eastern Tigray, southeast Amhara, and the eastern Somali region of Ethiopia. Spatial scan statistics identified 142 primary spatial clusters located in Afar, the eastern part of Tigray, most of Amhara and some part of the Oromia Regional State of Ethiopia. Children living in the primary cluster were 46% more likely vulnerable to poor consumption of foods rich in vitamin A than those living outside the window (RR = 1.46, LLR = 83.78, P < 0.001). Poor wealth status of the household, rural residence and living tropical area of Ethiopia were spatially significant predictors.Conclusion Overall, the consumption of foods rich in vitamin A was low and spatially non-random in Ethiopia. Poor wealth status of the household, rural residence and living tropical area were spatially significant predictors for the consumption of foods rich in vitamin A in Ethiopia.

The geographical heterogeneity of HIV infection and the impact of COVID-19 on the diagnosis of HIV at regional level are important to understand. This study aimed to estimate the HIV incidence by geographical region and understand how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced diagnosis of HIV. Methods: We used an extended back-calculation method to reconstruct the epidemiological dynamics of HIV/AIDS by geographical region. We used eight regions: Tokyo, the capital of Japan, Hokkaido plus Tohoku, Kanto plus Koshinetsu (excluding Tokyo), Hokuriku, Tokai, Kinki, Chugoku plus Shikoku, and Kyushu plus Okinawa. Four different epidemiological measurements were evaluated: (i) estimated HIV incidence, (ii) estimated rate of diagnosis, (iii) number of undiagnosed HIV infections, and (iv) proportion of HIV infections that had been diagnosed. Results: The incidence of HIV/AIDS during the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 to 2022 increased in all regions except Kanto/Koshinetsu (51.3 cases/year), Tokyo (183.9 cases/ year), Hokuriku (1.0 cases/year), and Tokai (43.1 cases/year). The proportion of HIV infections that had been diagnosed only exceeded 90% in Tokyo (91.7%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 90.6, 93.3), Kanto/Koshinetsu (91.0%, 95% CI: 87.3, 97.8), and Kinki (92.5%, 95% CI: 90.4, 95.9). The proportion of infections that had been diagnosed was estimated at 83.3% (95% CI: 75.1, 98.7) in Chugoku/Shikoku and 80.5% (95% CI: 73.9, 91.0) in Kyusyu/ Okinawa. Conclusions: In urban regions with major metropolitan cities, including Tokyo, Kinki, and Kanto/Koshinetsu, the number of undiagnosed HIV infections is substantial. However, the proportion of undiagnosed infections was estimated to be smaller than in other regions. The diagnosed proportion was the lowest in Kyusyu/Okinawa (80.5%), followed by Chugoku/Shikoku and Hokkaido/Tohoku. The level of diagnosis in those regional prefectures may have been more influenced and damaged by the COVID-19 pandemic than in urban settings. (c) 2024 The Authors.

Tropical species that do not naturally experience high temperature variability have a narrow thermal tolerance compared to similar taxa at temperate latitudes and could therefore be most vulnerable to warming. However, the thermal adaptation of a species may also be influenced by spatial temperature variations over its geographical range. Spatial climate gradients, especially from topography, may also broaden thermal tolerance and therefore act to buffer warming impacts. Here we show that for low-seasonality environments, high spatial heterogeneity in temperature correlates significantly with greater warming tolerance in insects globally. Based on this relationship, we find that climate change projections of direct physiological impacts on insect fitness highlight the vulnerability of tropical lowland areas to future warming. Thus, in addition to seasonality, spatial heterogeneity may play a critical role in thermal adaptation and climate change impacts particularly in the tropics.",biodiversity,climate change,elevation,global warming,insects,,,,,,,latitude,,,macroecology,,macrophysiology,thermal adaptation,,tolerance,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using partial regression, the variation in species richness was decomposed into the purely environmental fraction; the spatially structured environmental fraction; and the purely spatial fraction, including variables retained in cubic trend surface regression.Results Species richness of all taxa was positively correlated with temperature. Species richness of plants and butterflies was also positively correlated with the heterogeneity of landscape. The extent of low-intensity agricultural land and forest had a positive effect, and the extent of cultivated field a negative effect on the species richness of these taxa. The effect of soil characteristics on the number of observed species was negligible for all taxa.

Regressions investigated are: (1) multiple linear regression, (2) a simultaneous autoregressive error model, and (3) geographically weighted regression. The first is nonspatial and acts as a control, the second accounts for stationary spatial autocorrelation via the error term, while the third captures spatial heterogeneity through the modeling of nonstationary relationships between the response and predictor variables. The geostatistical-based simulation experiment generates data and coefficients with known multivariate spatial properties, all within an area-unit spatial setting. Spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity effects are varied and accounted for. On fitting the regressions, that each have different assumptions and objectives, to very different geographical processes, valuable insights to their likely performance are uncovered. Results objectively confirm an inherent interrelationship between autocorrelation and heterogeneity, that results in an identification problem when choosing one regression over another. Given this, recommendations on the use and implementation of these spatial regressions are suggested, where knowledge of the properties of real study data and the analytical questions being posed are paramount.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When geodata producers have finished updating their own database, the problem of how to use the updates in new version of MDB to update the users' database has become a research focus. Due to differences in some ways such as subject background, design methodology, application purpose, there may be much semantic heterogeneities between these two databases although they are abstraction of the same geographic phenomena. Because of these heterogeneities, GIS Client Database updating will be a complex and time-taking process.

Evergreen broad-leaved woody plants (EBWPs) are important components of numerous biomes and are the main contributors to the flora south of 35 degrees N in China. We calculated the grid cell values of species richness (SR) for a total of 6265 EBWP species in China, including its four growth-forms (i.e., tree, shrub, vine, and bamboo), and estimated their phylogenetic structure using the standardized phylogenetic diversity (SPD) and net relatedness index (NRI). Then we linked the three biogeographical patterns that were observed with each single environmental variable representing the current climate, the last glacial maximum (LGM)present climate variability, and habitat heterogeneity, using ordinary least squares regression with a modified t-test to account for spatial autocorrelation. The partial regression method based on a general linear model was used to decompose the contributions of current and historical environmental factors to the bio-geographical patterns observed. The results showed that most regions with high numbers of EBWP species and phylogenetic diversity were distributed in tropical and subtropical mountains with evergreen shrubs extending to Northeast China. Current mean annual precipitation was the best single predictor. Topographic variation and its effect on temperature variation was the best single predictor for SPD and NRI. Partial regression indicated that the current climate dominated the SR patterns of Chinese EBWPs. The effect of paleo-climate variation on SR patterns mostly overlapped with that of the current climate. In contrast, the phylogenetic structure represented by SPD and NRI was constrained by paleo-climate to much larger extents than diversity, which was reflected by the LGMpresent climate variation and topography-derived habitat heterogeneity in China. Our study highlights the importance of embedding multiple dimensions of biodiversity into a temporally hierarchical framework for understanding the biogeographical patterns, and provides important baseline information for predicting shifts in plant diversity under climate change.",evergreen broad-leaved woody plants,species richness,standardized phylogenetic diversity,net relatedness index,present climate,Ying Lingxiao,Zang Runguo,Jiang Youxu,,,,Quaternary climate variability,,,habitat heterogeneity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, its spatial pattern has received limited attention. Here, we examine Corine land cover diversity patterns across Europe, and test (1) if geographical (longitudinal, latitudinal) gradients exist, (2) if the scale of analysis (and specifically the grain of analysis) influences the patterns, and (3) if the thematic resolution affects the results. We estimated diversity landscape metrics for 2818 locations throughout Europe. We analysed the spatial pattern at five grains (0.25, 1, 25, 100 and 625 km(2)), and for three hierarchical levels of the Corine Land Cover 2000 classification scheme. To account for spatial autocorrelation, we used Clifford's test. Latitude was significantly correlated with land cover diversity (once spatial autocorrelation was taken into account) only at large grain sizes. Longitude, with a few exceptions at fine grain, was not correlated to land cover diversity. The spatial pattern of land cover diversity is scale-dependent, with spatial pattern at fine grain (< 1 km(2)) being statistically independent of the pattern at large grain (625 km(2)). Also the grain of the analysis affected the spatial autocorrelation of land cover diversity. Fine grain analysis displayed autocorrelation, but over short (hundreds of kilometres) distances, while large grain analysis displayed autocorrelation over longer distances (thousands of kilometres). Increasing the detail of the thematic resolution seems to have effects similar to increasing the grain size. The thematic resolution in certain cases influenced the results qualitatively and thus inference from low-resolution landscape analysis should be done with caution.",CLC2000,CORINE land cover land use,landscape diversity,scale-dependence,spatial heterogeneity,,,,,,,thematic resolution of classification scheme,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper focuses on the resistance and recoverability dimensions of resilience and analyzed the dynamic changes in economic resilience in China's Yellow River Basin in response to the 2008 economic crisis. The multi-scale geographical weighted regression model was utilized to examine the effect of key factors on regional economic resilience. Our findings show the following: (1) The resistance of the Yellow River Basin to the financial crisis was high; however, the recoverability decreased significantly over time. (2) The spatial heterogeneity of driving factors was significant, and they had different effect scales on economic resilience. Related variety, government agency, environment, and opening to the global economy had a significant effect on economic resilience only in a specific small range. Specialization, unrelated variety, and location had opposite effects in different regions of the Yellow River Basin. (3) Specialization limited the area's resistance to shock but enhanced the recoverability. Related variety improved regional economic resilience. Unrelated variety was not conducive to regional resistance to shock and had opposite effects on the recoverability in different regions. (4) Government agency and financial market promoted regional economic resilience. Environment pollution and resource-based economic structure limited regional economic resilience. Opening to the global economy and urban hierarchy limited regional resistance to shock, but strong economic development had the opposite effect of improved regional resistance.

Understanding the main metabolite types and characteristics of wild A. roxburghii is important for efficiently utilizing resources and examining quality according to origin. Methods Samples were collected from the main production areas across five regions in Fujian Province, China. An untargeted metabolomics analysis was performed on the entire plants to explore their metabolic profiles. We utilized UPLC-MS/MS to specifically quantify eight targeted flavonoids in these samples. Subsequently, correlation analysis was conducted to investigate the relationships between the flavonoids content and both the biological characteristics and geographical features. Results A comprehensive analysis identified a total of 3,170 differential metabolites, with terpenoids and flavonoids being the most prevalent classes. A region-specific metabolite analysis revealed that the Yongchun (YC) region showed the highest diversity of unique metabolites, including tangeretin and oleanolic acid. Conversely, the Youxi (YX) region was found to have the smallest number of unique metabolites, with only one distinct compound identified. Further investigation through KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted a significant enrichment in pathways related to flavonoid biosynthesis. Further examination of the flavonoid category showed that flavonols were the most differentially abundant. We quantified eight specific flavonoids, finding that, on average, the YX region exhibited higher levels of these compounds. Correlation analysis highlighted a significant association between flavonoids and habitat, especially temperature and humidity.

However, current analysis methods cannot objectively capture the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of GWSA, which might lead to erroneous inferences of the evolution mechanisms. Here, we developed a new framework to address the challenge of spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the GWSA evolution analysis. It is achieved by integrating the Bayesian Estimator of Abrupt change, Seasonal change, and Trend (BEAST), the Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies (BIRCH), and the Optimal Parameters-based Geographical Detector (OPGD). In the case study of the North China Plain (NCP), the GWSA time series is divided into four stages by three trend change points in BEAST. An increasing trend of GWSA is observed at Stage IV, and the third trend change point occurs before the third seasonal change point. This distinguishes the positive feedback of anthropogenic interventions and the effects of seasonal precipitations for the first time. Moreover, the spatial distribution of GWSA in the NCP is classified into two clusters by BIRCH in each stage. The differences in GWSA trends and responses to environmental changes between Cluster-1 and Cluster-2 are significant. Then the driving effects of 16 factors on the evolution of GWSA are identified using OPGD, in which the contributions of topographic and aquifer characteristics are highlighted by quantitative analysis. This framework provides a novel method for examining the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of GWSA, which can be extended to analyze spatiotemporal trends in GWSA at diverse scales.",GRACE,groundwater storage,spatiotemporal evolution,heterogeneity decomposition,driving factors,"Cheng, Jianmei","Ding, Kuiyuan","Luo, Yiming","Zheng, Kun","Xian, Yang","Lin, Yihang",North China Plain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper uses fuzzy rough sets for quantifying local and overall variable relationships to address this limitation, relying on the consistent degree between variables. This approach uses a sliding window to scan the entire study area and build a local region for each object. The local variable relation is quantified using the local average membership degree to the positive region for each object during the scan. The overall variable relation in the whole study area is quantified using the median value of the local consistent degree between variables in every local region, and the entropy of the normalized local consistent degree is used to measure the corresponding spatial heterogeneity. The proposed method can detect and compare local and overall variable relations.

For 12 univoltine butterfly species with sufficient data from at least four bands, we construct population growth rate models that include density dependence, temperature and precipitation during distinct life-cycle periods, defined to accommodate regional variation in phenology. We use partial R-2 values as indicators of butterfly population dynamics' sensitivity to weather and density dependence, and assess how these vary with latitudinal position within a species' distribution.Results: Population growth rates appear uniformly sensitive to density dependence across species' geographical distributions, and sensitivity to density dependence is typically greater than sensitivity to weather. Sensitivity to weather is greatest towards range edges, with symmetry in northern and southern parts of the range. This pattern is not driven by variation in the magnitude of weather variability across the range, topographic heterogeneity, latitudinal range extent or phylogeny. Significant weather variables in population growth rate models appear evenly distributed across the life cycle and across temperature and precipitation, with substantial intraspecific variation across the geographical ranges in the associations between population dynamics and specific weather variables.Main conclusions: Range-edge populations appear more sensitive to changes in weather than those nearer the centre of species' distributions, but density dependence does not exhibit this pattern. Precipitation is as important as temperature in driving butterfly population dynamics.

This paper examines whether preferences vary by geographical location. The motivation for examining geographic heterogeneity is the higher level of mortality experienced in Glasgow over and above that explained by deprivation, sometimes referred to as the 'Glasgow effect'. Data were collected from 3702 individuals across Glasgow, Manchester and Liverpool between July and November 2011. The results show evidence of geographic preference heterogeneity. Contrary to our hypothesis, individuals in Glasgow have a lower rather than higher time preference rate. Individuals in Glasgow are on average more risk seeking compared to Liverpool and more likely to be at the tail end of the distribution (very risk seeking) compared to Manchester. Differences in risk preferences may help explain some of the differences in mortality associated with risky health behaviours such as drug and alcohol use. However, individuals in Glasgow were also more future oriented suggesting that they are less likely to engage in risky healthy behaviours. As the differences in time and risk preferences work in opposite directions in terms of health investments it less likely that these differences can help explain excess mortality in Glasgow.

This research paper delves into the multifaceted effects of this policy initiative, focusing on the dynamic Yangtze River Delta region. The study employs a robust difference-in-differences (DID) model to analyze the policy's net impact on rural residents' income within Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces from 2017 to 2020. Our findings reveal that the program implementation has yielded tangible benefits, significantly increasing rural residents' per capita disposable income in these provinces. This positive outcome can be attributed to the program's funding allocation, accelerating agricultural infrastructure development, enhancing product productivity and quality control. Consequently, this amplifies the market premium effect, contributing substantially to income growth. However, the research also underscores the importance of considering regional heterogeneity. While Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces have experienced significant gains, Anhui Province lags due to varying resource endowments and development stages. Moreover, the time-lagged effect of policy implementation plays a role in these disparities. Based on these insights, we propose a set of policy recommendations. First, continued implementation of the Agricultural Product Geographical Indication Program should be prioritized, focusing on enhanced funding management and multi-party participation. Second, harnessing regional cooperation and resource sharing is vital for optimizing policy outcomes. Finally, the establishment of a comprehensive risk prevention and control mechanism is crucial for the industry's resilience in the face of unforeseen challenges. This research provides empirical evidence of the program's economic benefits and valuable policy implications for China's journey towards high-quality agricultural development and rural prosperity, aligning with the overarching goals of innovation, entrepreneurship, and societal progress.",Agricultural development,Geographical indication,Rural income,Policy impact,Economic development,"Lu, Yong","Zhao, Xiaoyu","Wang, Zhiwei",,,,Quality improvement,,,Difference-in-differences (DID) Model,,Yangtze River Delta,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The countryside, the past landscape and the heritage are key themes in the new historical geography through the micro or small place histories. Research into key cases of studies allows for the elaboration of broader interpretive frameworks. Current methodological trends are highly influenced by the general orientations of cultural and rural geography, with broad relevance to qualitative methodologies on selected cases. This allows for a mundane geographical history from below that breaks with the general interpretive schemes of academics experts. This has notably influenced the research sources used in the new historical geography with the emergence of oral histories as a source of research for the preparation of contrasted biographies of places and the articulated use of new and old or classic sources-mainly archives-of information. The development of an environmental history in the context of the new historical geography is due to the relevance of the hybrid relationships between nature-culture society that currently characterize modern geographical research.",historical geography,countryside,academic traditions,heritage,place,,,,,,,history of geography,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Row_473,"Pei, Tao","Sobolevsky, Stanislav",Uncovering the Directional Heterogeneity of an Aggregated Mobile Phone Network,TRANSACTIONS IN GIS,NOV 2014,2,"The aggregated mobile phone network (AMPN) (i.e. the calling time or numbers are aggregated at every vertex), which records the call volume between different places over time, has been studied extensively to reveal the mobility patterns of residents, etc. Nevertheless, most previous works were implemented based on the non-directionality of the network model. This simplification may overlook some important characteristics of AMPN. To explore the AMPN as a directional network model, we introduce the concept of directional heterogeneity in the study of AMPN data. The heterogeneity is twofold: (1) the imbalance of vertex (difference between outgoing and incoming calls of the vertex); and (2) the reciprocity of each edge (difference between the directed weights of the same edge). Taking the data of Singapore as an example, we systematically analyze the directional heterogeneity of AMPN. Our findings include three aspects. First, the AMPN shows as more unbalanced in the night-time than in the daytime, and its imbalance decreases as vertex granularity increases. Second, the directional heterogeneity varied with locations. Specifically, the residential area is dominated by deficits and others by surpluses. Third, the trajectories of incoming and outgoing calls follow a similar geographical pattern (i.e. southeast-north-south-north-southeast), indicating the calling behavior and routine mobility of users over time and space.",,,,,,"Ratti, Carlo","Amini, Alexander","Zhou, Chenghu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
