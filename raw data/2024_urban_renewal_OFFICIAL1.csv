Row_1,"Ebert, Martin",Practical aspects of morphological research in urban renewal,URBAN MORPHOLOGY,2024,0,"The small towns of North- Eastern Germany suffered great losses in historic buildings and economic dynamics during the Second World War and the subsequent decades of communist rule. Since 1990, these communities have suffered a major decrease in the number of inhabitants, resulting in a large number of buildings being empty. To adjust the urban structure to twenty- first century standards and regain economic vitality, both regional and local governments are supporting urban renewal projects. Sites inside medieval town centres are under pressure to amalgamate and be recreated as large- scale developer architecture or to fall into ultimate decay. As part of the study of medieval urban structures, a study of the site of the former Holy Spirit Hospice (Heiligengeist- Quarter) of Woldegk has been carried out. This paper shows how contextualization and a re- definition of the site, based on historic narratives developed by morphological research, inspired authorities and stakeholders to initiate a narrative- based development of the site. It demonstrates that urban renewal, based on historic narratives, creates wide public support for contemporary redevelopment in small urban communities. It further shows how morphological research is contributing to the establishment of relevant narratives.",post,war urban renewal,Woldegk,medieval town centre,narratives,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed a new deep learning approach for characterising the structural evolution of block-scale UGS in urban renewal scenarios. Taking Beijing and Shanghai as models, we first segmented the study areas into block-scale grids and trained a random forest model based on a local climate zone framework to identify the spatial morphological classes of the grids. Second, we established a VGG16-based deep learning model to identify UGS structural types. Finally, we examined the associated patterns of grid spatial morphology and UGS structure under different renewal scenarios. We found that six distinct types of UGS structure are associated with different urban morphological classes. Spatial and temporal variations of UGS structures were observed in terms of direction of conversion, activity level, and extent of improvement to service level. Holistic and micro-renewal approaches drove positive evolution of block-scale UGS structures mainly by reducing building density and via precise optimization, respectively. Our results provide a reference for urban renewal policies and planning guidelines for block-scale UGSs in high-density cities.",Deep learning,Green space,Structure,Urban morphology,Urban planning,"Zhang, Shining","Liu, Bowen","Li, Tianjiao","Shi, Jixin","Zhan, Huiying",Urban renewal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Row_3,"Zhu, He",Investigating the mechanisms of sustainable urban land renewal: A perspective of spatial development rights,SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY,AUG 15 2024,4,"Urban renewal, as an important means of promoting sustainable urbanization in the stock era, is essentially a process of redistributing land appreciation benefits caused by spatial development rights. However, current literature mostly analyzes the traditional two-dimensional renewal model from the perspective of market mechanisms, which leads to the inability of urban land renewal mechanisms to adapt to sustainable urban development. Therefore, taking Shenzhen as an example, our study aims to understand the spatial mechanism of urban land renewal from a three-dimensional perspective of spatial development rights. Using geographically weighted regression and two -stage least squares regression, we found that the objective of value analysis has shifted from the common minimum unit of land to local space. Moreover, affected by the surrounding environment and various supporting public service facilities, the existence of spatial heterogeneity leads to significant differences in the value of the different functional space within same geographical ranges. The influence intensity of economy, society, and environment shows a decreasing pattern in space from the center of the region to the outer circle of the region. We not only construct a sustainable urban land renewal framework based on threedimensional spatial property rights, but also distinguish the mechanisms and endogenous issues for different functional spaces.

Urban renewal projects that claim alignment with sustainable development goals still lack comprehensive studies of their impact on social segregation, as evidenced by the ongoing scholarly debate over whether urban renewal has a positive or negative effect on social segregation. This paper explores the dynamics of urban spatial segregation, analyzes the role of urban renewal on segregation, and bridges the gap in existing research by considering dynamic changes, multiple spatial scales, and diverse renewal types. Using multi -source data - house price data, planning permit data and points of interest -stepwise regression models are combined with t -test methods to examine the impact of multiple types of urban renewal on local and regional residential segregation in Shenzhen. Our findings are as follows: 1) Income -based segregation in Shenzhen increased from 0.77 to 0.81 across neighborhoods, from 0.62 to 0.73 across sub -districts, and from 0.58 to 0.67 across districts between 2000 and 2020, therefore increasing at all scales but with more pronounced growth of segregation observed between units at larger scales; 2) Urban renewal can lead to greater income similarity amongst residents of a sub -district, by attracting more high -income people to move in, but this can lead to increased residential segregation of high- and low-income people at the macro -scale. 3) When assessing the impact of urban renewal on segregation, it is recommended to consider the variations in outcomes resulting from temporal changes, spatial scales, the types of renewal, the types of segregation, and the stages of urbanization.

The fieldwork exposed these covert infringements endured by neighborhood residents, revealing parallels between workplace mobbing actions-representative of rights violations-and the detrimental experiences during urban transformation agreements. Consequently, mobbing literature was evaluated along with the fieldwork and adapted to urban renewal.

During the agreement process, actors highly eager for renewal (the state, developers, some neighborhood residents, and family members) implemented various mobbing actions to disrupt the communication channels, social relationships, personal reputations, health, and built environments of residents, aiming to coerce them to approve the agreement by creating an hostile atmosphere. Consequently, urban renewal projects, which promise to enhance residents' quality of life, severely deteriorate the living conditions of existing residents even during the agreement phase and render the neighborhoods uninhabitable. Given the projected increase in such projects in Turkey, more urban residents may face mobbing in the future. Therefore, a more comprehensive investigation of mobbing in urban renewal, making it provable and legally recognized, is crucial for mitigating the harmful effects of the agreement process and protecting the rights of the victims.",Negotiation phase,pressure,urban renewal,mobbing,harassment,"Yildiz, Iclal Sema Dincer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In another way, achieving sustainable urban development requires more improvements. Equity, sustainability, and universality are core principles of sustainable development and should be integrated into urban renewal strategies. For instance, urban renewal in old town areas presents multiple challenges, including balancing public investment needs, social justice considerations, and environmental impacts. Studies have shown that inequalities often arise during implementation, disproportionately affecting low-income residents in old town areas. While energy justice is a key concept for reducing these inequalities during renewal process, however existing frameworks lack a multi-dimensional approach. This study proposes a comprehensive evaluation framework that combines sustainable development with energy justice principles during the renewal of old town areas. This framework aims to achieve equitable and sustainable development outcomes in renewal of old urban areas by systematically examining the unequal impacts on lowincome groups and proposing equitable energy services and inclusive policies. The proposed equity evaluation framework includes two key components: 1) Main factors in existing renewal strategies, which include equitable access to energy resources, sustainable energy systems, affordability, and public participation. 2) Criteria for refining energy justice evaluation framework, which include accessibility, energy efficiency, community participation, and policy coordination. The research emphasizes the importance of fairness in providing affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy opportunities within urban renewal initiatives.

The Entropy Weight--TOPSIS method is then employed to derive the final optimal decision based on selected indicators. Applying the decision framework to the G15 Jialiu Widening and Reconstruction Project in Shanghai, China, indicators are reduced by 48.3%, with the optimal scheme decision consistent with the traditional Entropy Weight-TOPSIS method.

The interplay that takes place between sustainable targets tends to be very complicated. This study proposes a decision-making support framework that can quantify the synergies and trade-offs between economic, environmental, and social targets pertaining to land use change and public open space (OS) provision in urban renewal processes. The proposed decision-making support framework operates at both neighbourhood and building levels, and is comprised of three analytical components: a redevelopment trend analysis module, a three-dimensional land use simulation module, and a sustainable performance evaluation module. One high-density and ageing district in Hong Kong, Yau Mong district, was selected as the case study area for this work. Six planning scenarios were built which reflect various priorities and principles including economic benefits, environmental benefits, the equal distribution of OS provision and enhancing the quality of OS. The findings suggest that there is a trade-off relationship between economic-environmental targets, a synergic relationship between social-environmental targets, and a mediational relationship between economic-social targets. Planning strategies such as rezoning, land use reconfigurations, plot ratio adjustment and the transfer of development rights could be triangulated as strategic approaches by which to maximising the synergies and achieve better sustainability.

Controlled Shrinking in the Urban Renewal of Genoa,URBAN PLANNING,2024,1,"This article explores three examples of urban design initiatives in Genoa in an attempt to highlight the potential and possible contradictions that controlled shrinking projects pose for the future of contemporary cities. Genoa, a symbol of Italian shrinking cities, has been strongly defined over the years by post-industrialisation transformations and by long-standing conditions of urban shrinkage. Despite facing continuous shrinkage, local urban development policies have historically focused exclusively on urban growth and expansion. Only recently have some areas in Genoa started to adopt spatial planning experiences that actively pursue degrowth policies, aiming to reduce existing urban fabric and decrease urban density. These initiatives are adopted in specific areas affected by demographic decline, hydrogeological risks, pollution, or catastrophic events. These spatial strategies justify their existence by invoking concepts like smart shrinkage and degrowth, promising improvements in both environmental and social conditions. However, this article notes how these concepts in Genoa are not aligned with the actual social and environmental challenges that these considerations and positions pose. In fact, the urban renewal initiatives introduced by institutions, in reality, lean towards a strategy of shrinkage and demolition of residential complexes, transportation infrastructure, and productive spaces, with diverse and conflicting results. The observed controlled shrinking projects neglect the synthesis of the territory as a palimpsest, ignore new ecological sensitivities, and lack awareness of the social implications associated with the concepts of smart shrinkage and degrowth. Instead, the three instances introduce a spatial project that still adheres to the underlying principles of growth and exploitation, presenting a shrinkage of the existing urban fabric that is mere illusion. It involves clearing out the deteriorated spaces only to fill them with capitalist rhetoric and models that, instead of creating space, undermine fundamental rights. Nonetheless, a closer examination of these three missed opportunities sheds light on the necessary knowledge, actions, and design approaches for a city to navigate urban shrinkage adeptly.

The results demonstrate that even if resistance is not collective or publicly visible, this does not mean that it does not exist. We located four repertoires of resistance in the interviews: reflective, emotional, rejective, and face-to-face.

Urbanization that takes place without taking into account these legal and technical bases lead to the emergence of informal, risky and dysfunctional settlements. Over time, these settlements become increasingly vulnerable due to their failure to meet social and technical requirements, making their sustainability increasingly challenging, and inevitably becoming subjects of urban renewal activities. Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform's archive of satellite images provides temporal monitoring of urbanization on Earth for about 50 years and analysis of changes in the cloud environment.

Land use/cover maps classified with the Random Forest algorithm correlate urbanization activities in urban renewal areas with the entry into force date of the spatial plans that guide the settlement. The classification results evaluated in conjunction with statistical tests and spatial plan decisions demonstrate that unplanned urbanization is a serious obstacle to the sustainability of settlements.

Addressing conflicts and power differentials involving governmental bodies, market forces, community residents, experts, and scholars is crucial for fostering sustainable urban heritage development. Recently, these contradictions have grown more pronounced as China's urbanization has transitioned from rapid expansion to a phase focused on existing urban assets. In the present research, the typical traditional courtyard-style residential buildings in Jinan, a historic city in northern China, were selected as the object of study. These houses often suffer from problems such as outdated infrastructure and low living conditions and have become difficult to adapt to contemporary urban life. A case study approach was employed focusing on a representative courtyard house to develop models for renewing and regenerating urban heritage, specifically tailored to traditional courtyard houses. The aim was to address conflicts and power disparities among urban heritage stakeholders through diverse mechanisms. Methodologically, the research integrates historical study and field investigation, participatory analysis, and policy analysis. Primary data sources include field surveys, historical research, oral interviews, and drone aerial photography. Models were constructed in the present study-namely, the heritage self-renewal, heritage revitalization, and heritage transformation models-for traditional courtyard houses. These models were designed to foster sustainable urban heritage development through collaborative efforts across various stakeholders and administrative levels. They will optimize the renewal mechanism of urban heritage, thus providing diversity and multiple possibilities for the preservation and reuse of architectural heritage in China.

As many LRAs are converted and renovated from underused properties, such as industrial buildings, they have become an integral part of the ongoing urban renewal yet remain insufficiently explored. Through the conceptual lens of spatio-temporal fix and state entrepreneurialism, and drawing on a field investigation in Beijing, this study presents three key findings. First, the renovation and conversion of diverse property stocks into LRAs exemplify a spatial fix strategy to defer the crisis resulting from excessive capital accumulation in the housing sales market over the past two decades. Second, financialization, as an effective political-economic instrument to promote LRA development, provides a temporary fix for the mounting capitalist crisis but may generate new crises if not properly regulated. Third, market practices of renovation and financialization are closely intertwined with and deeply influenced by state initiatives. This paper not only reveals a novel practice of urban renewal through the development of LRAs, but also advances the theoretical understanding of spatio-temporal fix under state entrepreneurialism. In the Chinese context, it goes beyond neoliberal endeavors addressing the capital accumulation crisis in the housing sector to mitigate the growing housing affordability crisis and maintain social stability through active state intervention.",Long-term rental apartment (LRA),Private rental sector,Urban renewal,State entrepreneurialism,Spatio-temporal fix,"He, Shenjing",,,,,Beijing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This gap is significant, as many residents must vacate their homes for an average of 3-5 years during Shantytown redevelopment, which brings about challenges of renting houses and the associated negative impacts on their well-being before returning to their resettled homes. Therefore, this study focuses on examining the temporary residence arising during Shantytown redevelopment while awaiting resettlement. We selected Heze city as our case study area, which has been through China's most intensive redevelopment between 2016 and 2018 that affected about 1.2 million population. A structured community survey was conducted, and 1035 valid samples were collected. We then applied spatiotemporal analysis and the Random Forest model to examine stability, direction, and distance of temporary residence mobility, along with its influencing factors. Findings reveal that 92.4% of households move just once or twice during the temporary phase, indicating the preference for stable residence. Regarding moving direction, households seek life service centers rather than city centers, and prefer familiar community environments. Furthermore, 74.8% of households resettled within 2.5 km of their original residence, indicating a preference for nearby temporary housing. The built environment emerged as the most critical factor influencing the mobility, followed by family socioeconomic status, while housing costs, surprisingly, having the minimal impact.

As rapid urbanization continues to be a global challenge, the economic impacts of different urban revitalization strategies hold crucial importance in informed urban planning and policymaking. This study uses a spatial hedonic approach to analyze the influence of distinct urban renewal and regeneration initiatives on land values. The results reveal that the urban renewal project, which involves significant physical upgrades and redevelopment, appears to substantially increase land prices. However, a deeper analysis accounting for spatial spillover effects indicates that most of this increase is due to the influence of high-value adjacent areas. Conversely, urban regeneration projects, which focus on enhancing the socioeconomic and cultural aspects of urban areas without causing drastic physical changes, consistently have a significant positive impact on land prices, even when spatial structures are considered. This study underscores that urban planners and policymakers should carefully evaluate the type of urban revitalization strategy to be implemented and its contextual spatial effects. The findings suggest that urban regeneration can be a more effective tool than urban renewal for sustainable urban improvement, contributing to enhanced land utility and neighborhood development.

Many mature methods have been used to reduce the risk of flood. The optimal design of impervious surfaces (ODIS) is an adaptive solution to urban flooding from the perspective of urban renewal planning. However, existing ODIS models are limited because they do not consider the drainage systems. To address this issue, this study proposes an elastic and controllable optimization model based on assumptions about rainstorm and drainage capacity, nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II), multivariate linear programming (MLP) and soil conservation service curve number model (SCS-CN) in a case study of the old town of Guangzhou city, China. The model not only coupled the drainage systems, but also collaboratively optimized the impervious surfaces and the drainage systems. The results show that the proposed model achieved an optimized efficiency of 5.70 %, which is more than a tenfold improvement compared to existing ODIS models. The study emphasizes that the optimization of the drainage system should be the focus and the optimization of impervious surfaces should be supplementary, and different flood risk areas require different optimization strategies. Furthermore, transforming impervious surfaces into a ""high-low-high"" spatial distribution of impervious surface densities is the optimal design solution for impervious surfaces.

Previous research often used isolated images, ignoring the temporal dimension of thermal infrared and reflectance data from Landsat sensors. Additionally, cost-effective and efficient methods for reconstructing time-series built height are lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, we utilized Landsat time-series data to reconstruct the yearly trends in urban form in Beijing, China, spanning from 1990 to 2020. Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) time series analysis method was used to identify urban growth and renewal years. Employing a reference height for 2020 and logical reasoning method, we reconstructed the annual dynamics of built-up heights, pinpointing years of significant change. Finally, we analyzed the alterations in urban form over the past three decades and their impact on surface temperature changes. Our change detection method achieved an overall accuracy of 86 %, demonstrating its effectiveness in determining the year of change. When compared with data from Lianjia and LiDAR point cloud, our height reconstruction method showed impressive accuracy, with R-2 values of 0.9773 and 0.9526, respectively. Analysis of summer and winter LST values revealed distinct temperature patterns across different building heights, with mid-rise buildings exhibiting the highest LST in summer and low-rise buildings registering the highest LST in winter. During periods of urban growth, both mean and amplitude values of LST increased, while during urban renewal (demolition), they decreased.

Accurately estimating the production of construction waste is crucial for assessing the consumption of urban renewal. However, traditional manual estimation methods rely heavily on statistical data and historical experience, which lack flexibility in practical applications and are time-consuming and labor-intensive. In addition, their accuracy and timeliness need to be improved urgently. Fortunately, with the advantages of high-resolution remote sensing images (HRSIs) such as strong timeliness, large amounts of information, and macroscopic observations, they are suitable for the large-scale dynamic change detection of construction waste. However, the existing deep learning models have a relatively poor ability to extract and fuse features for small and multi-scale targets, and it is difficult to deal with irregularly shaped and fragmented detection areas. Therefore, this study proposes a Multi-scale Target Attention-Enhanced Network (MT-AENet), which is used to dynamically track and detect changes in buildings and construction waste disposal sites through HRSIs and accurately estimate the annual production of urban construction waste. The MT-AENet introduces a novel encoder-decoder architecture. In the encoder, ResNet-101 is utilized to extract high-level semantic features. A depthwise separable-atrous spatial pyramid pooling (DS-ASPP) module with different dilation rates is constructed to address insufficient receptive fields, resolving the issue of discontinuous holes when extracting large targets. A dual-attention mechanism module (DAMM) is employed to better preserve positional and channel details. In the decoder, multi-scale feature fusion (MS-FF) is utilized to capture contextual information, integrating shallow and intermediate features of the backbone network, thereby enhancing extraction capabilities in complex scenes. The MT-AENet is used to extract buildings and construction waste at different periods in the study area, and the actual production and landfill volume of construction waste are calculated based on area changes, indirectly measuring the rate of urban construction waste resource conversion. The experimental results in Changping District, Beijing demonstrate that the MT-AENet outperforms existing baseline networks in extracting buildings and construction waste.

Calculating carbon emissions and sinks is a prerequisite to carving out a low-carbon path via urban renewal. In this paper, we take an environmental improvement project in the Suzhou Industrial Investment Science and Technology Park as an example. Under the framework of the entire life cycle, we define the ""renewal phase"", which includes ""demolition"" and ""construction"", as the calculation boundary, and use the emission coefficient method as the primary calculation approach to assess carbon emissions and sinks. We construct a design-oriented carbon revenue and expenditure estimation system based on the BIM model. After its application in empirical cases, the results show the following: (1) The building carbon emissions of Scheme A are 342 t higher than those of Scheme B, due to the fact that the ""demolition and construction"" works in the former increased by 6000 m2 compared to the latter. (2) The landscape carbon emissions of Scheme B are 269 t higher than those of Scheme A, due to the addition of a 2500 m2 reinforced concrete overhead walking platform. (3) The annual carbon sink of Scheme A is six times higher than that of Scheme B, due to the fact that the number of trees and shrubs in the former is five-to-six times greater than in the latter. The number of trees planted plays a decisive role in enhancing the carbon sink benefit. (4) In the year during which the renewal project was implemented, the difference in carbon emissions between Scheme A and Scheme B was 72.9 t. By the 16th year, the difference in carbon emissions between the two schemes approached zero, and the carbon reduction advantages of Scheme A became more pronounced over the entire life cycle thereafter. Finally, this article summarizes four low-carbon design strategies for industrial park renewal projects: rational construction and demolition, three-dimensional parking, low-carbon materials, and plant carbon sequestration.

Following stricter building codes, the district underwent significant demolition and construction between 2014 and 2015.

We find that urban regeneration due to building renewal may have diverse context-dependent effects on the demographic tapestry of communities, their culture and history. While some neighborhoods showed positive response to increased local amenities and resulted in reduced mobility outside their local area, leading to greater income segregation from the rest of the city, others behaved in the opposite direction.

Nevertheless, achieving the sustainable and high-quality organic renewal of urban residential property plots poses a significant challenge for planning. This study postulates that the crux of organic renewal for urban residential property plots lies in the impacts on improvement for sustainable built environment, with the main obstacle being the organization and implementation of intricate renewal activities. A potential solution is to enhance land property value, while establishing a digital twin to optimize the design of renewal strategies and implement renewal activities precisely and efficiently. This study scrutinizes the characteristics of the property value composition of urban residential property plots, investigates basic strategies of organic urban renewal and proposes a theoretical framework to elucidate dynamic property value change, property value enhancement and incremental value allocation during the renewal process. Additionally, a theoretical concept was developed to efficiently promote property value in organic renewal through digital twin construction. A comprehensive case study showcases the pronounced benefits of property plot renewal, including a 1.17-fold increase in floor area and a 50% rise in residential floor area unit prices. The research framework proposed in this study is conducive to promoting the optimization, fair allocation and efficient implementation of property value in organic renewal.

This paper proposes the hypothesis that governance structure and institution affect the functional system and adaptability of the community, and forms a framework of structural-institutional-functional adaptation. Using comparative analysis of cases from different governance structures and self-organizing foundations. The government governance structure and weak self-organization foundation of Hongmei community form the dependence on the government to improve the functional system. Qicai Community is a market governance structure, which realizes multi-functional adaptability in design, but the weak self-organization foundation increases the cost of operation and institution. Hemu Community is a multi-agent structure based on the self-organization institution, which improves the multi-functional adaptability under the cooperation of self-organization and the government. The case comparison shows that the governance structure and institutional adaptability are the basis of functional adaptation, which together constitute the system adaptability. From the perspective of CAS, the bottom-up self-organization structure has more flexible adaptability. The multi-agent governance structure based on the self-organization is more conducive to the improvement of functional adaptability.

While physical structures of historic importance might be preserved or adapted, the social and cultural significance of historic urban places is often lost during the comprehensive redevelopment of historic neighbourhoods. The absence of adequate measurements and procedures to assess the cultural and social values of historic districts remains a key concern in urban renewal practice. Recent advances in Big Data analysis of social media posts through Machine Learning-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools offer ways to quantify the social and cultural perception of historic urban districts and guide culturally sensitive strategies for revitalization. This research presents a novel workflow to analyse text data from social media platforms. Referencing recently developed methods for multidimensional text mining and sentiment analysis, it obtains online text data by identifying the keywords on the Weibo platform and applies BERTopic to construct a quantitative assessment of cultural perceptions by identifying the topics and sentiments about a historic district. Sentiment analysis tools were used to measure emotional polarity in posts to understand social media users' subjective views towards various urban places. Using the case study of Nantou Walled City in Shenzhen, a comparative examination of social media engagement before and after district renewal sheds light on the interplay between social media participation and historic district characteristics.

However, an oversight in post-occupancy evaluation (POE) impedes the comprehensive understanding of NMIR's impact and post-implementation efficacy. This research addresses this gap by leveraging the lens of place value to examine NMIR's outcomes. Using Wuhan, China, as a case study, 10 Delphi consultations and 28 interviews were conducted among five stakeholder groups: local government, planning professionals, academics, community workers, and residents. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation (FCE) were combined to identify and rank potential indicators. A total of 6 primary and 22 secondary indicators were identified. The indicators were derived from four key policy areas-health, society, economy, and environment-highlighting the relationship among NMIR initiatives, their contribution to place quality, and alignment with policy goals. AHP and FCE results reveal substantial enhancements in environmental quality, residential properties, and public infrastructure. Nevertheless, the analysis exposes varied satisfaction levels and divergences in the perceived relevance of indicators among the government, professionals, and the residents, particularly concerning social cohesion. These disparities underscore the layered impacts of NMIR. This research recommends integrating resident feedback with expert insights to enhance place quality in NMIR projects by balancing physical upgrades with social considerations. It also advocates for a continuous, adaptable post-occupancy evaluation system to monitor and support place value over time.

Nevertheless, the absence of a comprehensive framework for evaluating the potential of pocket park construction (PPC), one that integrates diverse influencing factors on a macro scale, has resulted in the random installation of such spaces, often failing to optimize the utilization of urban land. Addressing this critical lacuna, we propose an approach to evaluate PPC potential from a city -scale perspective, which is used to support the determination of which land units should be prioritized for PPC. A complete and feasible workflow was also established to identify potential land units, construct an index system for PPC combining demand and supply levels, quantitatively calculate indices based on remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS), accurately evaluate PPC potential using an entropyweighted TOPSIS model, and develop targeted renewal strategies. A case study in Dalian, China, demonstrated the applicability and implications of the workflow. The results showed that it is flexible and easy to adapt to different local contexts, allowing evaluators to introduce parameters considering the availability of local data, and will help decision makers to build pocket parks in the most effective plots, providing a strong reference for high -quality development in other high -density urban centers facing the contradiction between ecological construction and land scarcity.

Despite the project's significance, not only in terms of its scale and location in the centre of the Chilean capital city but also for having pushed the capacities of both the State and private companies, previous research has not addressed the full variety of tools brought together to carry out a project of this magnitude and ambition. This article describes the complexities of the San Borja project in its development. It argues that the ambition to renovate a central area in the capital city led its designers to shape and rely on ad hoc design and legal tools to make it possible.

In order to facilitate the optimization of renewal timing and strategy from the perspective of reducing the comprehensive global warming impacts, we put forward the low-carbon bridge renewal decision method referring to the ideas of consequential life cycle assessment (LCA) and dynamic LCA. In the proposed method, a comparative system boundary matching the bridge renewal characteristics is constructed, where the carbon emission reduction owing to the traffic efficiency improvement by functional updating is incorporated as the lowcarbon benefits of renewal, and three types of time-dependent factors, i.e., time-dependent characterization factor, trend factors and changes of traffic demands, are introduced to characterize the influence of renewal timing. The proposed method provided guidance for the renewal of Maogang Bridge, the first long-span cablestayed bridge in Shanghai. Results illustrate that the global warming impacts of renewal construction activities and the low-carbon benefits from functional updating decrease with the renewal timing. For Maogang Bridge, the rapidly increasing traffic demands inevitably advocated renewal in advance, and the reduction of global warming impacts from emission reduction or carbon uptake could be manifested for renewal in advance. Adopting material recycling in the disposal of old bridge helped reconstructing a new bridge while deconstructing the old one in 2019 becoming the finally selected low-carbon renewal strategy, which is expected to reduce 15.04 kt CO2e-2019 compared to the essential renewal in 2050 with the landfill disposal method. The robustness of the strategy choice has been justified, given the variations of analytical time horizon, expected emission trends and repair emissions. In this way, the low-carbon renewal decision method could build a quantitative basis for judging the urgency of functional updating and verifying the low-carbon benefits of immediate concrete recycling in up-coming urban renewals.",Bridge renewal,Low -carbon decision,Carbon emissions,Emissions timing,Material recycling,"Xiao, Jianzhuang","Ding, Tao","Guan, Xiangshuo","Chen, Jin",,Dynamic life cycle assessment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As part of the research, we dealt with the research question as to whether the application of the Act on the Promotion of Clean Vehicles (EU (European Union) Directive 2019/1161) will significantly increase the share of environmentally friendly buses by 2032 in the Slovak Republic (SR). The paradox of the application of the new legislation in the Slovak Republic is that, in public transport, the renewal of the vehicle fleet has significantly reduced, and will further reduce, the negative impacts of vehicle operation, but nothing will change significantly in suburban bus transport while a substantial part of the lines start and end at bus stations in city centres and a number of lines are for short distances, which can be operated by electric buses. Thus, the percentage of environmentally friendly automobiles in the Slovak Republic in urban bus transport will increase significantly. In suburban bus transport, we propose to change the legislation of the Slovak Republic in order to partially start increasing the share of environmentally friendly vehicles. Another follow-up research question was whether gross domestic product (GDP) per capita influences the increased share of environmentally friendly buses in the European countries studied. Based on the correlation measure, there is a significant connection between GDP per capita and the proportion of eco-friendly buses in certain nations. In areas with higher GDP, or in more advanced regions, there is a larger percentage of environmentally sustainable buses.

Our study puts forward an approach to evaluate the vitality quality of urban streets based on the visual and auditory perception of pedestrians, using the historic urban area of Guangzhou, China, as a case. We collected multi-dimensional data, including street view images, videos, sound recordings, and user preference questionnaires. Streets were classified into nine types based on varying levels of vitality quality and intensity. Our primary finding revealed a spatial mismatch: areas with better street quality often have lower activity vitality, and vice versa. This suggests urban renewal should focus on improving both aspects. Different street types require targeted improvements, such as enhancing commercial atmosphere in tree-lined streets, increasing greenness in arcade streets, and managing noise levels on high-level motorized roads.

The main assumption is that resource use-energy, materials, electricity, water, fossil fuels, soil, and humans-describes growth patterns whose sustainability can be categorized according to environmental fitness, which is assessed by the availability of environmental resources (characteristics of the environment) and the adaptation of the city to this availability (characteristics of the built environment). The article offers an innovative perspective by proposing a model for categorizing the sustainability of urban growth based on environmental fitness, but also by providing a mean to understand the city as a process and the city as a satisfier of needs. The methodology comprises two parts: (1) creating a matrix of indicators of urban environmental fitness and (2) constructing an urban growth sustainability index. From this methodology, six patterns emerged: (i) Economizing growth: available resources with maximum urban adaptation; (ii) Weak growth: availability of resources with minimal urban adaptation; (iii) Efficient growth: availability of resources with appropriate urban adaptation; (iv) Deficient growth: availability of resources without urban adaptation; (v) Efficient growth and of investment: lack of resources with urban investment; and (vi) Deficient growth and of degradation: lack of resources with urban deterioration and wear. The finding of these sustainable urban growth patterns demonstrates the concrete application of environmental adaptation theories and an understanding of the global behavior of cities. The empirical results support the assertion that urban growth presents challenges and potentials in terms of reduction, of reuse, and recycling; of urban sprawl, urban renewal, redevelopment and infill growth, and the efficiency and maintenance of urban infrastructure as guidelines for urban sustainability.",urban sustainability,environmental fitness,urban growth,sustainable urban growth patterns,indicators of sustainability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Colombia is undergoing a paradigm shift after pioneering the integration of green and blue infrastructure (GBI) into urban planning in the early 2000s (namely Estructura Ecol & oacute;gica Principal). A surge in river renaturalization initiatives is underway, with large and intermediate cities planning and executing projects. We systematically assessed the integration of rivers and GBI into local policies (Planes de Ordenamiento Territorial) and found widespread and strong recognition of streams, wetlands, and ecosystem services in urban planning, higher than previously reported. Most cities emphasize river multifunctionality, ecological connectivity, public space, and recreation, as well as disaster risk reduction, advancing toward sustainable urban water and drainage systems. However, significant gaps persist regarding climate change resilience, participation, and social justice. In a region marked by high inequality, pre-existing spatial exclusion could be amplified by urban renewal, greening, and tourism due to unfair resettlement conditions and gentrification. Such trade-offs can undermine the ecological and social benefits of restoration. We highlight the crucial role of civil society and grassroots activism in protecting and defending urban commons and conclude by recommending a critical examination of GBI and river restoration efforts in Latin America.

Moreover, the lower the property rents, the more intense the impact of HFB and the more likely it was to gentrify. It confirms our concern that green urban renewal would probably result in the displacement of the poor and that green initiatives aimed at common human well-being are more beneficial to the wealthy.

However, current research on domestic digital projection predominantly revolves around technical aspects, resulting in relatively uniformity in content and visual representation. Therefore, against this backdrop, this study innovatively introduces theatrical arts into the projection mapping of old urban community building facades to achieve deep interaction between dramatic content and community environments. Using the example of the digital projection artwork ""The Magic Flute"" at the Chongqing International Light and Shadow Art Festival in the Huangjueping community, the study primarily analyzes spatial forms, visual characteristics, digital interactions, and related interviews. This research contends that ""The Magic Flute"" transcends the realm of digital technology by establishing a unique binary structure of ""landscape-drama"" that deeply integrates landscape forms with dramatic content in the community, enriching the cultural content and narrative structure of digital projection works in old urban areas. Additionally, it proposes experimental methods led by theatrical arts, creates more delicate immersive experiences in community theaters, and uncovers the media art creation process closely aligned with the reality of old urban areas, thereby offering valuable insights to support the sustainable revitalization of old urban communities in China.",Old Urban Communities,Digital Projection Art,The Magic Flute,Landscape-Drama,,"Liu, Xiang","Zhou, Hongtao",,,,,,,,,,"HCI INTERNATIONAL 2024 POSTERS, PT III, HCII 2024",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Examples from China have shown that this process has led to poor social sustainability. Previous studies have not adequately addressed the issue of poor social sustainability. This study aims to address this gap by developing a set of valid and reliable performance indicators for assessing the social sustainability of urban regeneration initiatives in China's Historic Urban Areas (HUAs). Through an extensive literature review and a Delphi survey, critical social sustainability factors facilitating urban regeneration were identified. An assessment tool was subsequently proposed, comprising eight themes, 29 indicators, and a corresponding point-scoring system. Finally, Xi'an was selected as a case study to apply and test the applicability of the tool and to evaluate social sustainability performance to further explore improvement strategies. The results show that adequate housing, housing quality, participation in regeneration initiatives, and safe design were the most critical indicators determining the social sustainability of urban regeneration.

We expand upon this conceptualization of historical structural racism by examining the potential associations of probable blockbusting, urban renewal, and proximity to displacement from freeway construction, along with redlining, to multiple contemporary health measures. Analyses linked historical structural racism, measured continuously at the census-tract level using archival data sources, to present-day residents' physical health measures drawn from publicly accessible records for Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Outcome measures included average life expectancy and the percentage of residents reporting hypertension, stroke, coronary heart disease, smoking, insufficient sleep, sedentary behavior, and no health insurance coverage. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine separate and additive associations between structural racism and physical health measures. Redlining, probable blockbusting, and urban renewal were associated with shorter life expectancy and a higher prevalence of cardiovascular conditions, risky health behaviors, and residents lacking health insurance coverage. Probable blockbusting and urban renewal had the most consistent correlations with all 8 health measures, while freeway displacement was not reliably associated with health. Additive models explained a greater proportion of variance in health than any individual structural racism measure alone. Moreover, probable blockbusting and urban renewal accounted for relatively more variance in health compared to redlining, suggesting that research should consider these other measures in addition to redlining.

However, in the context of urban renewal, environmental gentrification has exacerbated inequities in urban park accessibility. Although research on green space equity is relatively rich, studies focusing on inequities in urban park accessibility in environmental gentrification areas and their influencing factors remain limited. This study aims to analyse inequities in urban park accessibility in gentrified areas and explore the effect of physical spatial and socioeconomic factors on these disparities. With Wuhan's main urban districts as the study area, environmental gentrification areas were identified using bivariate spatial autocorrelation analysis. An improved threestep floating catchment area(Multi-G3SFCA) method was used to assess the inequities in urban park accessibility across residential communities, and the Gini coefficient and Lorenz curve were used to quantify overall inequity in environmental gentrification areas. Finally, the RF-SHAP method was utilised to analyse the factors influencing accessibility inequities among residential communities. The results indicated that: (1) Environmental gentrification in Wuhan's main urban districts primarily occurs in lakeside and riverside areas. The average Gini coefficients for community and pocket parks were 0.953 and 0.994, respectively, indicating severe inequity. (2) Physical spatial factors (63%) contributed to inequities in urban park accessibility more than socioeconomic factors (37%). Proximity to rail transit and commercial centres contributed 38% and 22% to inequities, respectively, making them the primary determinants. (3) Although socioeconomic factors had a relatively minor overall effect, they directly influenced inequities and interacted with physical spatial factors. Elements such as the proportion of the ageing population and income levels play a notable role.

We address these voids by integrating the literatures of urban studies and crime and deviance to theorise the linkage between nearby gentrification and disorder policing. Using negative binomial regression models to analyse three years of arrest records from the Washington, DC Metropolitan Police Department, we find that the occurrence of gentrification in nearby block groups is associated with increased order maintenance arrests in the average block group.

Past studies, however, have primarily concentrated on regional and urban scales. The complexities of human-environment interactions necessitate a more fine-grained measure of urban morphology beyond two-dimensional spaces. This study delves into the intricacies of horizontal and vertical urban surfaces within community life circles. It examines humanscale landscapes using a bottom-up metric system that includes eye-level quality, road network design, buildings and functions, and neighborhood location. The methods of deep learning and street view images are utilized to evaluate the eye-level morphology. The study then analyzes the heterogeneous impacts and interaction effects of morphological variables on urban vitality at the community life circle level through multiscale geographic weighted regression and geographical detector model. The findings reveal a core-periphery structure and strong spatial autocorrelations between the morphological variables and urban vitality. Furthermore, the determinants of urban vitality exhibit a blend of global, regional, and local spatial contexts. The human-observed greenery, sky openness, and public bus accessibility demonstrate significant spatial heterogeneity linked to local vitality, whereas street betweenness and commercial facilities exhibit limited effects. The interaction effects between morphological variables can either enhance or weaken their individual impacts, highlighting the need for community life circle planning that considers the combined effects of these variables.

Recognized as the most accurate flux measurement method, the eddy covariance (EC) technique is widely used in the direct observation of CO2 and energy fluxes. Therefore, to better summarize and describe relevant research, this paper was based on all 127 studies in the Web of Science (WOS) that employed the EC technique to observe urban CO2 and energy fluxes and related auxiliary research from 2009 to 2022, and we further selected other classic studies to provide theoretical support to analyze CO2 fluxes, radiation, sensible heat, latent heat, anthropogenic heat and storage heat, which from the two aspects of the CO2 fluxes and surface energy balance (SEB). The variation characteristics of CO2 and energy fluxes were obtained by comparing observation data from various regions at different time scales, and the mechanism of flux change was explained based on the main influencing factors, thereby providing a general summary of the impact of urban heterogeneity. The results show that carbon emissions in urban areas are highly cyclical and vary greatly at different times and seasons. Due to the many factors affecting urban carbon emissions, urban carbon reduction cannot be limited to vegetation research. In addition, the heterogeneity of the underlying surface in urban areas has a great influence on the energy flux parameters. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the energy calculation models to more accurately assess SEB in urban areas. And the long-term observations at different locations are needed.

The model aims to establish a set of precise community retrofit indicators, covering aspects such as public participation level, public ancillary facilities, green space layout, living environment building, health service support, and accessible design. By employing prioritization strategies, the model seeks to maximize resident satisfaction and promote harmonious coexistence between the community and the environment. Firstly, the retrofit evaluation indicators are formulated using the SETS theory. The entropy weight method (EWM) is then applied to determine the initial weights of these evaluation indicators, followed by the use of the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method to analyze the interrelationships among the indicators. The Kano model is integrated to adjust the weights, reflecting their importance. The final weights of the indicators are determined through normalization. Based on this, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method is employed to rank and analyze the importance of age-friendly retrofits in the community. Finally, six communities in Dalian, Liaoning Province, China, are selected as samples to evaluate and analyze the age-friendly retrofit indicators.

To begin the research process, we summarised ten design elements for SoP and seven levels of SoP based on a literature review. Then, we conducted an on-site questionnaire survey to collect place users' perceptions on SoP. Subsequently, we developed a SoP conceptual framework by combining insights from prior studies and on-site users' perceptions. To test the conceptual framework and extract feasible urban design strategies for forming a strong SoP, we investigated three representative harbourside regeneration projects in the UK with high levels of SoP. The core design strategies employed in these projects are summarised in this paper along the following three dimensions: (a) mixed land use of residence, work, and tourism complemented by various supporting public facilities; (b) rich spatial relationships based on high degrees of accessibility, permeability, and rational urban tissue and development density; and (c) a distinctive place character formed by public space, architecture, and landscape design. These strategies would complement each other to develop a SoP design guideline based on a unique image, diverse activities, and reasonable forms. This study's findings can be instrumental in the empirical assessment, design, planning, and policymaking for promoting SoP in regeneration projects.",Sense of place,Harbourside regeneration,Urban design,Land use,Spatial relationship,"Jiang, Min",,,,,Place character,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on available academic studies, grey literature, and semi-structured interviews, this study empirically explores how urban village redevelopment has been carried out in two cities, Hangzhou and Guangzhou, through the lens of policy capacity. By contrasting policy outcomes and the manifestation of policy capacity at different levels in these two cities, we develop three arguments that contribute to our understanding of urban renewal and policy capacity. Firstly, the performance of any policy action is affected by the capacity of the central actor to develop and implement policies. Secondly, understanding the interactive logical between analytical, operational, and political capacities under different governance modes is the key to understanding the strengths and weaknesses of policy capacity in a specific sector. Shaped by local contexts and past experience, local governments are predisposed to path dependence in developing and deploying policy capacity in urban village redevelopment. Thirdly, the capabilities and resources needed to support policies are largely determined by policy problematization at the analytical level: the technique-based approach of policy capacity theory needs to complete the missing link between policy framing and ethical issues.",policy capacity,urban village redevelopment,governance mode,path dependence,China,"Liao, Liao","He, Yujie","Zhang, Qianying",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is limited research, particularly in the Global South, examining the role of CSR in the enhancement of open green spaces and its contribution to shaping urban landscape identity. This study investigates CSR-driven beautification projects in Kisumu City, Kenya, where corporate-funded initiatives have sought to improve urban landscapes through the landscaping of road islands and roundabouts, alongside broader urban renewal efforts. The article aims to document the spatial attributes of these CSR projects; assess their current status in terms of cleanliness, safety, and maintenance, as well as identify the challenges faced in implementing projects is not only to promote the city's unique urban identity, but also to enhance the corporate image through landscape branding. A qualitative research methodology is employed, involving field observations, GIS mapping, and photography, complemented by purposive interviews. The findings reveal not only diverse landscape designs, including water features and sculptures, but also highlight significant issues with upkeep, safety concerns from street urchins, and the overall deterioration of some sites. These results are valuable for policymakers in city governments and corporations involved in CSR projects, offering insights into how such initiatives can better contribute to urban landscape identity, city branding, and the sustainability of urban beautification efforts.",city beautification,corporate social responsibility,corporate brand advertising,landscape branding,landscaping,,,,,,public open spaces,sustainability,urban landscape identity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

UCSs are crucial for timely tracking of urban expansion and renewal progress, understanding settlement environments and human activities, and achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3 and 11. However, distinguishing UCSs from other land covers remains challenging, whether using spatial texture and spectral features or time-series characteristics. There is an urgent need for a universally applicable UCS mapping method at the national scale, a gap that current research has yet to fill. In this study, we proposed a method combining geospatial data with remote sensing data for national UCS mapping under medium spatial resolution. Additionally, we combine the UCS mapping results with SDGSAT-1 GLI data to evaluate the utilization status of new construction areas, thereby supporting SDG 11.3. The results showed that, for six representative cities, the F1-Score and Matthews Correlation Coefficients (MCC) for exposed UCS mapping results ranged from 98.83 % to 99.49 % and from 0.64 to 0.77, respectively. Variable importance detected in the Random Forest (RF) model highlighted that the key to identifying UCSs lay in geospatial information describing UCS spatial distribution, including distance to roads, city boundaries, and dust-proof nets. The assessment of the utilization status for new construction areas highlights the differences in the utilization status with which cities at various stages of development utilize these new areas. We then compared the ability of UCS distribution with existing impervious surface products in reflecting the dynamics of urban construction. The results showed that UCS spatial distribution could reflect urban construction patterns more timely and accurately, providing key insights for urban planners.

This study employs machine learning models such as Long Short Term Memory networks-Convolutional Neural Networks (LSTM-CNN), Object Semantic Attention Network (OSANet), HighResolution Net (Hrnet), and EXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), combined with hotspot analysis and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) methods. We revealed the potential impact of urban village IGS landscapes on residents' complaint sentiments. The results indicate: (1) Complaint sentiment text analysis shows that negative emotions in residents' complaints account for 85.4%, with hotspot areas spreading outward from the city center. The spatial autocorrelation of IGS indicators shows a strong clustering effect, with significant changes at the boundaries of hotspot areas near the city center and in the northeast.

As a major global economic and carbon-emitting power, it is necessary to advocate for China to accelerate the construction of low-carbon and resilient cities. We have formulated a comprehensive methodological framework to appraise the effects of urban resilience (UR) on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. This study first constructs a ""social-economic-institutional-ecological-engineering"" UR assessment framework. Based on this framework, we establish an evaluation system for the UR of the urban agglomeration to explore the dynamic evolution of its spatial and temporal patterns. And then this study uses the SBM-DEA method that includes undesirable outputs to measure the carbon emission efficiency of the urban agglomeration. Finally, the spatial Durbin model is used to analyze the spatial spillover effects of UR on CO2 emissions, and the mechanism of CO2 emission spatial effects is theoretically explained by introducing geographical laws. The results show that the overall UR level in the region increased from 0.107 in 2000 to 0.318 in 2020, with an average carbon emission efficiency of 0.82, but still at a relatively low level. Moreover, there are significant differences in the regional level, with Guangzhou and Shenzhen and their surrounding cities showing significantly higher levels compared to other cities. Regarding the spillover effects analysis, CO2 emissions exhibit significant spatial spillover effects between cities.

Time-series urban land use (ULU) maps are vital for capturing dynamic land changes in the urbanization process, giving valuable insights into urban development and its environmental consequences. Recent studies have mapped ULU in some cities with a unified model, but ignored the regional differences among cities; and they generated ULU maps year by year, but ignored temporal correlations between years; thus, they could be weak in large-scale and long time-series ULU monitoring. Accordingly, we introduce an temporal-spatial-semantic collaborative (TSS) mapping framework to generating accurate ULU maps with considering regional differences and temporal correlations. Firstly, to support model training, a large-scale ULU sample dataset based on OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Sentinel-2 imagery is automatically constructed, providing a total number of 56,412 samples with a size of 512 x 512 which are divided into six sub-regions in China and used for training different classification models. Then, an urban land use mapping network (ULUNet) is proposed to recognize ULU. This model utilizes a primary and an auxiliary encoder to process noisy OSM samples and can enhance the model's robustness under noisy labels.

They are pivotal in fostering supportive communities, in particular for low-income residents in sub-standard housing. However, their outdated overall environment impedes the delivery of adequate support to residents. Prior research on street markets has focused on those in the Americas and Europe, and has revealed the societal support values of these markets. However, studies on street markets in high-density cities like Hong Kong are lacking. This study introduces an evaluation framework to assess the impact of street markets on the development of supportive communities for Hong Kong's sub-divided apartment residents. Employing the Pei Ho Street market in Sham Shui Po as a case study, an importance-performance analysis highlights critical but underperforming factors including public facilities, activity venues, commerce, and employment. Based on these findings, the study proposes four improvement strategies for the renewal of street markets in high-density communities, which could apply to other cities with similar high-density urban environments. It concludes that street markets in Hong Kong display unique spatial characteristics shaped by low-income lifestyles in a high-density urban environment, enriching daily social life and promoting sustainable community development.",street markets,supportive community forming,urban environments,Hong Kong,,"Song, Jusheng","Yu, Lei","Bai, Yunxi","Zhang, Jianfeng","Chan, Man-Ha Sylvia",,,,,,"van Ameijde, Jeroen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the one hand, a decrease in available generational capacity means that planned blackouts, known as load shedding, have increased to record levels over the last few years; on the other, the country has instituted an ambitious agenda to decarbonize its energy infrastructure. These processes have both caused upheaval across the country's cities and raised questions regarding the politics of infrastructural provision and development. This article contributes to these debates by exploring the confluence between infrastructure, urban development, and (geo)politics. In particular, we put concepts from critical infrastructure studies (ruin, renewal) into dialogue with Gramscian traditions of political economy in order to analyze what the ongoing breakdown of South Africa's energy system reveals about shifting power dynamics within the state apparatus. Likewise, we ask whether multi-scalar processes of infrastructural renewal will produce more equitable energy futures. We posit that the energy crisis is creating the pressures and policy space for a considerable reorganization of South Africa's governance, largely taking the form of decentralization wherein large cities attempt to attain significantly more autonomy vis-a-vis the central state. Nevertheless, as the crisis engenders movements and counter-movements, renewal is likely to be a protracted, and contested, process.",Infrastructure,South Africa,energy,decarbonization,state transformation,"Carmody, Padraig",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The research findings reveal the key scale in the cross-scale evolution of urban textures, with variations in scale dependence and hierarchical evolution characteristics among different types of urban texture. The traditional urban texture displays sensitivity to scale changes, maintaining its integrity and internal connectivity at small scales. On the other hand, the texture characteristics of modern and contemporary urban areas are only discernible at larger scales.

Does the Urban Form of Territories Influence the Risk of Exclusion?,REVUE INTERVENTIONS ECONOMIQUES-PAPERS IN POLITICAL ECONOMY,2024,0,"Aging at home is a trajectory that governments have been promoting for many years, and that seniors and their families appreciate. However, aging at home is not a static or linear experience. As people's lives evolve, so do their neighbourhoods, placing individuals in different situations, more or less favourable from the point of view of inclusion, participation and, more broadly, control of their residential environment. This dual evolution is particularly visible in the immigrant areas of metropolitan agglomerations like Montr & eacute;al. The environments in which both immigration and aging are concentrated vary widely in terms of urban form (inner-city, peri-urban, suburbs, etc.) and urban dynamics (renewal, requalification, gentrification, etc.). These differentiated dynamics sometimes correspond to favoured areas that may be experiencing impoverishment, and sometimes refer to areas undergoing relatively significant social and economic change, posing challenges for urban policies that are just as challenging. Using the concept of residential normalcy, we look at 3 types of living environments (established immigrant communities, requalifying communities, and sprawled immigrant communities). Seniors achieve residential normalcy when they report generally positive feelings about their living environments, the people, groups or institutions that shape their daily lives, and the activities they are able to choose and carry out. Many of the factors that exclude established immigrant communities are related to access to urban resources, particularly institutional recognition. If access to mobility and transportation is a factor of fragility, to be able to follow the trajectory of the community of belonging in the agglomeration, the anchoring of the community of belonging in its environment is a strong factor of inclusion. For areas undergoing redevelopment or sprawling, it's the very location and presence of urban resources that raises questions, giving visibility to individuals and communities.

The irrational decision of urban renewal led to serious economic waste and environmental unsustainability. In this regard, this study proposes and validates a method for regeneration diagnosis and optimal regeneration of RBs based on circular economy (CE) theory. A hybrid diagnostic tool of life cycle cost (LCC)-life cycle assessment (LCA) model to systematically evaluate the economic and environmental impact of RBs throughout the circular lifecycle was proposed. On this basis, with the minimum average annual economic and environmental impact as the objective function, the optimal dynamic regeneration cycle of RBs is obtained using a multi-objective optimization method. The results of the case study show that: (1) The discount rate and deterioration rate changes the development tendency of economic and environmental data, which brings a new regenerating time point, (2) the economic impact of RBs' regeneration tends to be more pronounced during the intermediate stages, while the environmental impact becomes more significant in the later stages, (3) the environmental benefits of regeneration outweigh the economic benefits, (4) the regeneration of all building elements at the local optimal level leads to enhanced comprehensive benefits compared to multiple regenerations of a single building element. The feasibility of the method employed in this study has been corroborated by practical case studies.

Results show the large proportion of applications related to reterritorialization of food systems, development of recreational activities, and production of green energy. These on-farm diversification trends highlight the transformation of peri-urban areas from a natural or agricultural landscape into a multifunctional landscape, posing several planning challenges. Planners don't know how to assess whether a new building is really essential for farming, or to find the right trade-offs to support farming dynamics while limiting soil sealing. Their assessment criteria generally favor large, full-time, and economically viable farms. Comparing two provinces' planning practices, we observe significant differences in interpretation of national law, with incoherent or unharmonized criteria applied especially when assessing professional farming activities, new dwellings, and solar energy projects. We also highlight two potential obstacles to farmers' generational renewal and agroecological or food transitions: i) lack of transparency regarding the rules and the decision-making processes behind building permit assessment, and ii) the frequent rejection of applications for multi-purpose premises and lightweight, mobile, or dismantlable structures.

This article describes participatory action research where the authors of the article collaborated with a local city planning activist at the Kontula Mall, Helsinki (Finland) to improve the participation of a group marginalized from the renewal process (i.e., immigrant entrepreneurs) using a PPGIS tool (Maptionnaire). The case study provided insights into the potential for city planning activism to bring out marginalized groups' perspectives and use PPGIS. Moreover, the research also revealed barriers to polyphony in current planning practices. Nevertheless, planning activism can enable the participation of the marginalized by coming into contact with them, providing them with information, and bringing their perspectives to the collaboration. The PPGIS tool can serve as a platform to collect participatory data through different response modes. Local activism can also facilitate the questionnaire's co-design, testing, and marketing. Therefore, a bottom-up approach can be a way to improve the impact of PPGIS and enhance polyphony in urban planning.",bottom-up participation,city planning activism,expanded urban planning,Finland,immigrant entrepreneurs,"Nummi, Pilvi",,,,,polyphonic urban planning,PPGIS,public participation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Skeptical about whether logistics parks really take effect as expected, this paper investigates the local process of creative destruction in the logistics industry, focusing on how government-led logistics parks bridge between firm exit and firm entry during industrial renewal. Using firm-level data of third-party logistics firms in China from 2003 to 2021 and adopting system GMM estimator method, we verify that previous exit contributes to future entry but varies by the firm type and the city's importance in the regional transport network. Furthermore, we find two major roles of government-led logistics parks: (1) accelerating this process by providing the platform where various resources can be reused and reorganized into high-quality new logistics firms; and (2) prioritizing the rebirths from local existing firms over arrivals from other cities, though with some level of local protectionism.

Failures to properly resolve such conflict often lead to impeded urban regeneration and/or loss of cultural values. Although previous studies have analyzed the mediating role of various types of indirect stakeholders in historic urban regeneration, they have not further examined various effects of indirect stakeholders. Inspired by the theories of dependence, deterrence, and agency among stakeholders, this study explains the different effects of indirect stakeholders on the three parties (government, developers, and residents) following the evolutionary game theory. Specifically, replicator dynamics equations are established to simulate the evolution paths of the government, developers, and residents in the tripartite game involving indirect stakeholders through a case study for the historic regeneration of Zhongshan Road in Nanning, China. Modeling parameters are obtained through semi-structured interviews and quantified analyses of policy documents. The results reveal that indirect stakeholders (1) show a positive ally effect benefiting the stability of government strategies, (2) have a negative deterrent effect conducive to the stable evolution of developers, and (3) have an indirect leverage effect on the evolution of residents. Our study makes contributions by (1) designing a new indirect stakeholder mechanism to urban regeneration, and (2) establishing a new analysis framework for the tripartite game in urban regeneration.

For this reason, forests within city limits are increasingly seen as part of public health promotion. Being in an urban forest can take many forms, but there is still little known about whether being in a forest alone, without engaging one's senses, is as effective for human renewal as an experience that involves greater, more conscious activation of the senses of sight, hearing, smell. A study measuring the effect of the forest (spring aspect) on human mental relaxation during passive exposure was conducted on a sample of 19 Polish young adults. The experiment consisted of two series. In the first, participants read an academic textbook in a tree stand for 20 min, while in the next session-conducted at the same location-they contemplated the landscape. Before the experiment and after each of the two series of tests, four psychological questionnaires were administered: the Profile of Mood State (POMS), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the Restorative Outcome Scale (ROS) and the Subjective Vitality Scale (SVS). Analyses showed that being in a forest environment positively influenced the subjects' mental relaxation, while the level of benefit from the activation of the senses, especially vision (looking at the forest) was significantly higher compared to the passive activity of reading a text.

It is hence essential to identify their forming factors and analyze their spatial distribution features, so as to pave the way for sinkhole risk assessment and mitigation for urban sustainable development. Investigation of urban sinkholes poses a significant challenge because of the multi-factor's confusion, as well as the spatial uncertainties in susceptibility mapping due to urban renewal frequently. To address these issues, a comprehensive urban sinkhole risk assessment framework was proposed, and Shenzhen city in South China was selected as a case study area, where a lot of sinkholes occurred along with intensive human construction activities in recent years. Initially, the sinkhole susceptibility map was drawn using the grey relation analysis (GRA) method, incorporating the spatial information database of meteorology, geology, metro and pipeline systems, and then both the sinkhole density map and the time-varying land subsidence monitoring database were used to verify the accuracy of the sinkhole susceptibility map. Furthermore, the sinkhole risk assessment map in transportation system was subsequently drawn based on the susceptibility map, where the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and the advanced geophysical exploration technologies were employed to probe the potential sinkholes in critical risk areas. The conclusions reveal that the sinkhole susceptibility map based on GRA method demonstrates a promise in identifying the likelihood of urban sinkholes, and the risk assessment framework can be employed for the prevention and remediation of urban sinkholes, which contributes to an economical and efficient scheme for sinkhole detection, as well as transportation system resilience assessment at a city-wide scale.",Sinkhole,Spatial distribution,Susceptibility mapping,Risk assessment,Grey relation analysis,"Jiao, Yu -Yong","He, Ling-Ling","Tan, Fei","Zhu, Hua-Mei","Wei, Hui -Long",,,,,,"Zhang, Qian-Bing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The identification of primary driving factors involves correlation, path, and determination coefficient analyses. Subsequently, univariate regression, multiple linear regression, and LASSO regression methods are employed to construct prediction models for UUS demand. Additionally, the link between historical data and UUS demand in each city was studied separately. The findings reveal that GDP per km2 and GDP per capita comprehensively capture the influence of urban population, economy, and transportation on UUS demand. Notably, GDP per km2 makes the most significant contribution to the proposed regression models, followed by GDP per capita.

In the early 1950s, the Boston Redevelopment Authority labeled the neighborhood a slum, and implemented a redevelopment plan. The West End's 'renewal' resulted in the destruction of a vibrant, diverse neighborhood and the displacement of thousands of residents.

A high-risk old neighborhood (4.5 km2) in Changsha, China, is selected as a case for empirical analysis. Two types of SWPs-in-situ detention, and runoffreceiving units-are initially established based on spatial mapping and potential analysis. The core feature of the SWP system is a multi-horizon 2D-1D model predictive control (MPC), which directly verifies the suitability of terrain configurations and evaluates temporal efficiency. The study plots the performance curves of the SWPs under various design rainfalls and demonstrates flood dynamics using an actual torrential event. The findings indicate that SWPs' resilience contribution index for the stormwater system ranges from 9 % to 38 %. Furthermore, SWPs covering only 5 % of the site lead to an obvious decrease in flooded areas, with reductions ranging from 46 % to 48 %.

To better understand the impact of urban green space coverage's spatial pattern on land surface temperature (LST), this study selected three sample areas along the urban-rural gradient in Shanghai. Using LST inversion and resampling methods, LST data for different grid sizes were obtained for spring, summer, and winter in the 2010s, 2015s, and 2020 s. A boosting regression tree model was employed to determine the key indicators affecting LST and effective cooling thresholds. The impact of green quality, structure, and pattern at the community scale on LST was discussed, providing feasible suggestions for green space planning and design in different urban spaces. The study found significant differences in the spatial patterns of green areas and LST among the three sample regions. The quantity and integrity of green spaces in the Huangpu, Minhang, and Songjiang sample areas have progressively improved, with overall green coverages of 19 %, 38 %, and 43 %, respectively. As grid size increases, the relative influence of fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) on LST generally decreases, whereas the relative influence of green structure and patterns gradually increases. Taking the summer of the 2020 s as an example, the influence of FVC on the three study sample areas was 80.79, 83.36, and 87.18 at a 30 m grid size, which decreased to 48.87, 40.59, and 47.64 at a 120 m grid size. The green structure's impact rose from 13.09, 15.22, and 10.6-30.01, 51.82, and 38.5; the influence of green patterns increased from 6.12, 1.42, and 2.21-21.13, 7.6, and 13.86. Key indicators affecting LST include FVC (Fractional Vegetation Coverage), AREA (Green Patch Area), PD (Patch Density), COHESION (Patch Cohesion Index), and ED (Edge Density). High temperatures in summer are one of the ecological issues that need special attention in Shanghai's green space design. Setting the green space proportion to 35 % while avoiding fragmentation and low vegetation coverage can achieve effective cooling. This study's main advancement lies in utilizing machine learning algorithms to identify the principal green spatial pattern impact factors and key thresholds influencing LST at the community scale in Shanghai. The related results and proposed strategies provide a research framework and strong basis for special regulations in urban green space system planning concerning urban thermal environments. They offer references for urban renewal and new town planning to address climate change and urban high-temperature issues, such as clear requirements for optimal green space area at the community scale, community park spatial layout and quantity regulations, and urban park planning design suggestions.

Particularly in cities such as Barcelona and Madrid, housing prices have not stopped rising since 2014. This increase in prices has resulted in the population having to spend an increasing proportion of their income on housing, which aggravates the anxiety about housing insecurity, especially among the most disadvantaged social groups, as well as intensifying the dynamics of urban vulnerability. Cities such as Barcelona, Madrid, Paris, London, New York, Chiang Mai and Lisbon have established themselves as important economic, financial, logistical and innovation centers. Specifically, Barcelona has become a prominent space in southern Europe, attracting numerous investments in the field of modern technologies and the creation of start-ups. This process of restructuring and globalization has led, among other things, to the growing arrival of an international population with high levels of qualifications and medium and high incomes, significantly higher than the average for local citizens. This trend has intensified significantly since the COVID-19 pandemic, with the spread of remote work. In addition to this phenomenon, the high level of tourism in the city has contributed to significant tensions in the housing market, whether due to tourism (Cocola-Gant, 2016), work tourism (Cook, 2023) or digital nomadism (Vagena, 2021; Reichenberger, 2018). Digital nomadism consists of privileged mobility processes, where remote work, lifestyle and consumption opportunities are the main migratory motivation (Janoschka & Haas, 2013). The confluence of all these processes, in the framework of the urban transformations developed in the area under the umbrella of the 22@ project, only exacerbates the dynamics of gentrification, in this case transnational, experienced by areas of the city of Barcelona, such as the Poblenou and Parc i la Llacuna neighborhoods. The aim of this article is twofold: on the one hand, to analyse the role played by digital nomads in the socio-demographic and economic transformation of the neighborhoods of El Parc i la Llacuna and Poblenou, and their gentrification dynamics. And, on the other hand, to characterise the profile of this social group, with special emphasis on the motivations and interests that prevail to settle in these neighbourhoods. The work combines qualitative and quantitative analysis quantitative analysis, to favour a more integrated analysis of quantitative and qualitative data (Moscoloni, 2005), which facilitates the thematic deepening and a better approach to the object of study. The The main data collection techniques developed have been: i) A statistical-descriptive statistical-descriptive analysis, based on official secondary data; ii) A questionnaire with open-ended questions, aimed at people with a profile of transnational migrants and nomads profile, to give a preliminary profile of their characteristics; iii) And a group interview, which delves deeper into the dimensions of the study, such as the dimensions of the study, such as the socio-economic profile of the migrant, the motivation for migration with regard to the motivation for migration in relation to consumption habits, lifestyle and personal experience, and the and personal experience, and the perception of gentrification, related to access to housing and relationship with residents. The main results of this work are incipient evidence that in the neighbourhoods of Parc i la Llacuna and Poblenou transnational gentrification processes are beginning to be observed, linked to digital nomadism and the expatriation of businesses (expats), which coexist with the more consolidated gentrification dynamics related to touristification and urban renewal. The confluence of these processes, coupled with financial speculation and lack of housing supply, mainly social housing, leads to rising housing prices, rents or shortages of supply, which intensifies important changes in the traditional dynamics of employment, housing and socio-demographic and urban transformation in these contexts. These changes translate into tensions and conflicts on issues such as housing availability and access, social cohesion and urban sustainability. The empirical data also provide nuances on the problematisation of the profile of digital nomads or expats, pointing firstly to the diversity of this group. The data analysed portray young people between the ages of 20 and 30, students and workers, from privileged countries. However, their testimonies also echo how they suffer from the dynamics of precariousness, both in terms of housing and work, which distinguishes them from elites from high-value sectors, and invites us to ponder their influence on the rise of the real estate market and the generation of enclaves of gentrifying foreigners (L & oacute;pez-Gay, 2020).",transnational gentrification,digital nomadism,business expatriates,urban transformations,Barcelona,"Sanjuan, Victor Climent","Cano-Hila, Ana Belen",,,,Poblenou,Parc i la Llacuna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this paper is to quantify the effects of a LEZ on vehicle pollutant emissions, considering potential short-term variations of travel habits after its introduction (i.e., vehicle replacement, modal shift and destination change), and the associated uncertainty. The study area was the Municipality of Padova (Italy), where a LEZ is likely to be enforced. A holistic evaluation framework was applied combining a behavioral model and a traffic simulation model, calibrated using responses from a mobility survey administered to local stakeholders and traffic counts. The results highlighted the measure could contribute to induce fleet renewal and modal shift toward sustainable transportation means, that could be furtherly fostered by increasing the awareness of the benefits of the LEZ. Furthermore, the outcomes confirmed that the intervention could significantly reduce vehicle pollutant emissions within the area.

Understanding Children's Relationship With Nature in the Wake of Covid-19,URBAN PLANNING,2024,0,"The pandemic has significantly interrupted the already declining relationship between children and nature in recent decades. Despite the widely recognised benefits of contact with nature for general well-being, efforts to improve this relationship and reconnect children with nature have been unsuccessful so far. Although the pandemic may have represented a kind of new opportunity to restart that relationship, several studies indicated a growing gap between those who regularly engage with nature and those who do not, a gap that has been exacerbated by the pandemic. This case study investigates how children perceive their contact with nature before, during, and after the pandemic, and explores its meaning. Participants, aged between 11 and 16 years old, were recruited from schools in both rural and urban areas of Czechia and completed an online questionnaire (n = 123), followed by online group interviews with those who consented. Descriptive analysis was used to analyse quantitative data, and later thematic analysis provided insight into open-ended questions and qualitative data from interviews (n = 20). Results showed that participants spent less time in nature now than they did during the pandemic, although they acknowledged the importance of nature. A commonly cited barrier to spending more time in nature is lack of free time. The overall accessibility and quality of nature in the neighbourhood influenced participants' time spent in and interactions with nature. Although they perceived some benefits, participants were reluctant to use virtual nature because of concerns about reduced contact with real nature and the accessibility of technical equipment. These findings provide valuable insights for local government to address issues such as accessible nature and the quality of natural areas in relation to the relationship between children and nature in the younger population. By creating such an environment, local authorities could improve the impact of nature as a resource for promoting children's mental and emotional well-being.",children,nature relationship,post-pandemic,virtual nature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the importance of a watershed approach in land management is generally acknowledged, studies on this topic have typically focused on theoretical models, water management in rural areas or single case-studies of cities or countries. In this research, a scoping review of the literature was performed, based on the PRISMA 2020 statement, in three databases: Web of Science, Google Scholar and SciELO. Forty-one studies were identified analyzing 17 city cases implementing urban actions from a watershed approach in water management. These cities were from the Global North and Asian rising world powers. The lack of results of cities from the Global South, based on the research undertaken, was the main limitation and bias identified. Most of the Global South results identified in this research were theoretical models, scenarios and cases of rural areas instead of urban contexts. The results obtained indicate that the main motivations for cities to implement a watershed approach were water scarcity, floods and contamination of water bodies. The implemented actions focused on the shift from gray to green and blue infrastructure and on conservation measures. Lastly, the challenges to introduce those actions were mainly the lack of economic investment, insufficient experience, stakeholder opposition, and regulatory obstacles.

To characterize urban development at an accurate spatiotemporal scale, a change detection model is not only required to provide accurate location (Where) and time (When) of the changes, but also semantic information on the change types (What). Accordingly, this study proposed a deep learning method for temporal semantic segmentation change detection (TSSCD) that obtains information on the where, when, and what of changes simultaneously. TSSCD model bridges the semantic gap between remote sensing time series abrupt changes and land cover changes by learning the month-to-month mapping from spectral information to land cover types. We implemented a temporal semantic segmentation model based on the most classic fully convolutional network, where all two-dimensional convolutions and pooling operations were replaced with one-dimensional. We conducted tests on the TSSCD in several urban study areas, and it consistently exhibited good accuracy. In most cases, it outperformed the BFAST and CCDC algorithms, except when only a single spectral band was used. Simultaneously, we analyzed the minimum data requirements for training a TSSCD. The TSSCD currently faces challenges in achieving strong generalization beyond the training data distribution. Additionally, we observed that change detection for specific land cover types can be achieved through the flexible configuration of TSSCD. Finally, we explored a method for constructing datasets using existing products to minimize data annotation efforts, yielding promising results. However, there is still some gap compared to complete manual annotation.

This research, anchored in the resilience characteristics of robustness, redundancy, resource deploy ability, and rapid response, devised a resilience clustering factor system specifically designed for older urban districts. The old city district of Shijiazhuang, China, was selected as the empirical case study area. This research employs the K-Means++ clustering method to analyze the region's resilience units against waterlogging. Furthermore, it utilizes the method of pedigree classification to categorize the identified ten types of resilience. Secondly, these were subsequently divided into three primary categories based on a spectrum of strengths and weaknesses within each unit: dominant, mixed, and disadvantaged clustering. This categorization unveiled the unique resilience distribution patterns within the area. The findings of this study reveal a pronounced differentiation in resilience types among the units in Shijiazhuang's old city district. This spatial analysis highlighted a significant heterogeneity, with a tendency towards cluster formation. The spatial distribution of different resilience unit types was found to be uneven, leading to the emergence of clustered, patch-like, and zonal agglomerations. Combined with the unit clustering classification and the mean clustering performance of each factor, the response unit of waterlogging control resilience planning is determined for the study area, and the strategy of resilience waterlogging control and linkage is proposed. By mapping the spectrum of rainwater resilience types across the studied area, this research broadens the scope of resilience evaluation from a traditional vertical-level assessment to a more comprehensive horizontal typological analysis, offering empirical, theoretical insights for future resilience-building endeavors in older urban districts.",rainstorm waterlogging,the old city,waterlogging resilience,cluster analysis,K-Means plus plus,"Li, Jinglun","Namaiti, Aihemaiti",,,,planning strategy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study was conducted in the Ukrainian regions of Crimea (2012 to 2013) and Kyiv and its suburbs (2015 to 2018, 2021 to 2023). We examined 1321 forage trees and 849 colonies of 9 ant species in Kyiv and suburbs; and 413 trees and 141 colonies of 2 ant species in Crimea. The methods we used included transect examination of the trees with ants along a 10 m wide strip, measuring tree sizes (trunk girth) and recording ant species and numbers. Most ant species show a negative relationship between distance from the tree and the number of workers, indicating that the farther from the tree, the less is the number of ants. In natural habitats, higher numbers of ants and greater distances to forage trees are observed compared with urban or semi-urban habitats. Quercus robur, Pinus sylvestris and Acer platanoides were the most visited trees with a total visit frequency of 0.86 of the total number of records. In urban habitats, Lasius niger and Lasius emarginatus controlled an average of one tree each, and Crematogaster subdentata controlled an average of 5.8 trees. In urban habitats (Kyiv and suburbs), more common were colonies of two ant species (L. niger, Formica cinerea). There was no significant correlation between the distance from the nest to the forage tree and the tree size. Ants show different dispersal strategies in different habitat types.

Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) have proven to be a solution because they can significantly reduce the occurrence and consequences of road crashes. Although many ADAS technologies will be mandatory on new trucks in 2024, it will take more than a decade before the benefits are realised due to the average fleet renewal time. To accelerate this process, the most promising solution is therefore the introduction of aftermarket ADAS (also referred to as 'retrofit' ADAS) on the circulating fleet. This study aims to identify a tailored solution for retrofitting ADAS capable of providing pedestrian collision warnings on heavy vehicle fleets currently circulating in urban areas. The study involves a sample of vehicles and drivers operating in the metropolitan areas of Florence and Pistoia for waste collection services. The company owner of the vehicles integrated a commercial camera-based ADAS system with three additional cameras installed on the frontal bumper and edges of the vehicle, linked with three screens positioned in the vehicle cabin. In this study, a field test campaign was performed integrating trials in a proving ground closed to traffic with testing and monitoring in urban areas. This allowed to define a set of recommended parameters depending on vehicle speed that represent a good balance between alert frequency, minimizing false positives and ensuring that the alerts indicate real potential hazards to the driver.

This article focuses on the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region and investigates the LST influencing factors of various local climate zone (LCZ) built types from perspectives of urban morphology, land cover, and human activity. The results suggest that the areas of urban LCZ built types vary across cities within the BTH region, attributed to differences in city size and gross domestic product (GDP). The area of urban LCZ built types in Beijing and Tianjin, cities with significantly high city sizes and GDP, exceeds 2000 km(2). In contrast, in Qinhuangdao, Zhangjiakou, and Chengde, which have relatively low GDP, this area is less than 500 km(2). However, the main LST influencing factors for the same LCZ built type across cities are highly consistent. Building coverage ratio (BCR), average building height (ABH), and pervious surface fraction (PSF) are the three most important factors. The correlation between BCR and LST is mainly concentrated on compact high-rise and open high-rise types, with Pearson correlation coefficient (r) ranging from 0.2 to 0.44; the correlation between ABH and LST is mainly concentrated on compact high-rise, compact mid-rise, open high-rise, and open mid-rise types, with r ranging from -0.2 to -0.52; the correlation between PSF and LST is concentrated on almost all LCZ built types in cities within the BTH region, with r ranging from -0.2 to -0.56. By integrating these findings with the features of each LCZ built type within the BTH region, the specific LST mitigation strategies were further proposed. This article can help to develop specific LST mitigation strategies within the context of coordinated development of the BTH region, thereby promoting healthy and sustainable development in the region.",Urban areas,Land surface temperature,Land surface,Temperature,Morphology,"Peng, Yifei","Li, Youfang","Zhou, Xilin","Xie, Yuquan",,Meteorology,Surface morphology,Human activity,land cover,land surface temperature (LST),,,,,,,,,local climate zone (LCZ),remote sensing,the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region,urban morphology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Futian Mangrove National Important Wetland, located in the northeast of Shenzhen bay, is a part of the Guangdong Neilingding-Futian National Nature Reserve. As the smallest national nature reserve in China, the wintering habitat of migratory birds has been significantly impacted by the compacted surrounding built-up environment. It has become an urgent need for refined high-quality ecological restoration for the habitats. This project leveraged Nature-based Solutions to develop a refined model for the ecological restoration of coastal wetland waterbird habitats in compact urban areas. By analyzing waterbird behaviors and habitat requirements, this model outlined six strategies: water surface expansion, water level control, hydrodynamic conditions improvement, shoal transformation, adaptive vegetation management, and disturbance control. To effectively guide the restoration implementation, high-, medium-, and low-adaptive approaches were proposed accordingly. After restoration in 2022, notable increases in target species, such as Platalea minor, were observed. The variety of waterbirds of the reserve in 2022 increased by 33% compared with 2021, while increased by 50.9% compared with 2016, significantly enhancing ecosystem services of the coastal area. As urban renewal in China is shifting towards spatial redevelopment, this model offers valuable insights for ecological restoration aiming at coastal wetland waterbird conservation across the country, and substantially supports establishing the ""International Mangrove Center"" in Shenzhen.",Nature-based Solutions,Coastal Wetland,Ecological Restoration,Waterbird Habitat,Biodiversity,"Liu, Yue","Che, Di","Zhou, Wenjun","Hu, Liuliu","Lin, Yuan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although street view images (SVIs) are widely used in urban studies, it overlooks the interconnection among different locations, which can also affect perceptions about environmental recognizability. To address this issue, this study proposes a deep learning-based model called RB-Node, which comprehensively integrates spatial structural features in a road network view and visual features from SVIs, achieving 82.56% accuracy. It appears that image information from visual features dominates environmental recognizability. Additionally, structural information contributes significantly to the accurate classification of nodes and waterfront promenade areas. Moreover, scene-text information, a subset of visual features, helps classify commercial and historical areas. Furthermore, 1056 samples were collected through an eye-tracking experiment to validate the recognizability evaluation results, as well as compare the decision-making process between humans and RB-Node. According to the results, RB-Node behaviour and human observed behavior follow similar patterns, although human perceptions tend to be more holistic than RB-Node's.

By detailing the phenomenology of club nights, we develop a new Durkheimian theory of disruptions that explains how and why some members of a community are motivated to renew rather than replicate existing institutional structures.

However, there is a lack of in-depth study on exploring the classification of resident engagement clusters in the SOCR and developing a comprehensive evaluation system to measure this engagement. Therefore, this paper categorizes resident engagement into distinct clusters and develops an evaluation method for quantifying resident engagement in the SOCR. First, this study identified seven types of engagement clusters in the SOCR drawing from educational psychology and Arnstein's citizen engagement ladder theory. Second, an evaluation indicator system with 5 primary indicators and 21 secondary indicators was developed through a literature review and expert interviews. Third, a hybrid evaluation method combining the Analytic Network Process (ANP) and Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations II (PROMETHEE II) was established to effectively quantify resident engagement in the SOCR. Finally, 16 typical communities from five Chinese cities were selected as study areas to examine resident engagement in the SOCR. The results demonstrated that the full engagement cluster achieved the highest scores at the individual level, while the non-engagement cluster recorded the lowest scores. At the city level, Shanghai attained the highest overall engagement score, whereas Chizhou recorded the lowest. Several strategies were proposed to improve resident engagement in the SOCR.

Our research focuses on the years 2013-2018, when state planners and officials began working with PR agents to promulgate state-generated, pro-growth representations of plans through mainstream media outlets. We focus on coverage of three types of large-scale plans, all of which involve complex and varied knowledge contents: city master plans, new neighborhood plans, and urban renewal plans. Using critical discourse analysis and semi-structured interviews with key planners and journalists, we examined what kinds of knowledge and information about these plans were conveyed, and how. We found that a significant percentage (some 40%) of the articles published during this period were based directly on state- issued press releases, and exclusively conveyed state-sanctioned perspectives. We interpret this as an attempt by the state to highlight its own role in planning and housing, while taking advantage of journalists' lack of planning knowledge and pressure to publish in order to construct 'citizen-technocrats' whose knowledge mirrors that of state-affiliated actors. We situate these findings within the emerging academic discourse on ""technocratic populism,"" a form of governance in which populist regimes communicate technocratic knowledge directly to citizens, and show how mis/disinformation tactics usually associated with populist discourse now appear in planning communications in Israel.

Using data for large European cities in the period 2018-2021, we examine whether LEZs may explain differences in the recovery patterns of traffic in European cities after the shock of Covid. Controlling for several city attributes, we examine whether LEZ cities are less congested before and after the pandemic in comparison to non-LEZ cities. LEZs may have been more effective in reducing congestion after the pandemic because the fleet renewal process has slowed down or, alternatively, LEZs may be a proxy of unobservable factors related with attitudes of governments and citizens toward a sustainable mobility. Our results validate the traffic-mitigating role of the LEZ after the Covid-19 pandemic, although such result only holds for the pioneering LEZ cities. Hence, the traffic-mitigating role of the LEZ after the Covid-19 pandemic seems to be related to unobservable attributes that influenced the early decision to implement a LEZ.

This study aims to quantify this difference in exposure during daily travel, by carrying out a micro-sensor measurement campaign. The pollutant exposure was assessed simultaneously over predefined routes in order to allow comparison between different transport modes having the same starting and ending points. During the six-week measurement campaign, the average reference values for PM background concentrations were 13.72 and 17 . 92 mu g/m(3) for the PM2.5 and PM10 , respectively. The results revealed that the mode with the highest exposure to PM2.5 adjusted to background concentration (PM2.5 Norm) was the bus (1.65) followed by metro (1.51), walking (1.33), tramway (1.31), car (1.09) and finally the bike (1.06). For PM10 Norm, the tramway had the highest exposure (1.86), followed by walking (1.68), metro (1.65), bus (1.61), bike (1.43) and finally the car (1.39). The level of urbanization around the route and the presence of preferential lanes for public transportation influenced the concentration to which commuters were exposed. For the active modes (bike and walking), we observed frequent variations in concentrations during the trip, characterized by punctual peaks in concentration, depending on the local characteristics of road traffic and urban morphology. Fluctuations in particulate matter inside public transport vehicles were partly explained by the opening and closing of doors during stops, as well as the passenger flows, influencing the re-suspension of particles. The car was one of the least exposed modes overall, with the lowest concentration variability, although these concentrations can vary greatly depending on the ventilation parameters used.

Yet, when it comes to understanding the role of the built environment, a disproportionate focus on redlining obscures other historical policies and practices such as blockbusting, freeway displacement, and urban renewal that may impact contemporary child development. We hypothesized that historical structural racism in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania's, built environment would be associated with fewer contemporary educational, socioeconomic, and health opportunities. We also hypothesized that these measures would explain more collective variance in children's opportunities than redlining alone.METHODS We used geospatial data from the US Census, Mapping Inequality Project, and other archival sources to construct historical measures of redlining, blockbusting, freeway displacement, and urban renewal in ArcGIS at the census tract level. These were linked with data from the Child Opportunity Index 2.0 to measure children's opportunities across domains of education, socioeconomic status, and health. We ran spatial regression analyses in Stata 18.0 to examine individual and collective associations between structural racism and children's opportunities.RESULTS Historical redlining, blockbusting, and urban renewal were largely associated with fewer contemporary educational, socioeconomic, and health opportunities, and explained up to 47.4% of the variance in children's opportunities. The measures collectively explained more variance in children's opportunities than redlining alone.CONCLUSIONS In support of our hypotheses, novel measures of structural racism were related to present-day differences in children's opportunities.

The main objective is to introduce and validate the design of a clean grid-independent hydrogen supply station, a transformative solution envisioning a fleet powered by H-2 generated from a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer (PEMEL) based renewable microgrid, overcoming challenges posed by H-2 pricing and aligning with NZE goals.The design process involves developing a tailored PEMEL-based microgrid for hydrogen production. Analyses include a simple payback (SPB) period evaluation and validation, comparing the proposed configuration with microgrid setups by other authors. Despite challenges, the grid concept associated with fleet renewal demonstrates real-world viability and economic benefits, providing a compelling case for adoption in urban bus fleet renewal. With a 40% reduction in TCO compared to FC bus renewal and a 10% reduction compared to diesel buses, it represents a sustainable and economically sound solution that significantly contributes to the global sustainability agenda.",advanced energy systems,hydrogen,optimization and control,renewable energy,,"Sorrentino, Marco","Desideri, Umberto",,,,,,,,,,"PROCEEDINGS OF ASME 2024 18TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY, ES2024",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Referring to the theory of planned behavior (TPB), combined with the characteristics of regeneration decision-making, the external environmental factors affecting residents' participation in such decision-making activities, through impacting psychological environmental factors, were determined by establishing the structural equation model (SEM) and conducting a survey. The guidance measures of enhancing external pressure and providing regeneration information were selected. Participation guidance experiments were designed, and the typical communities located in the development zone and city center of Harbin, China were selected as the experiment regions. Forty-eight subjects were screened in each experimental region and divided into six groups; three participated in the experiments regarding the leading role of representatives, enhancing communication, and incentives, and three in the experiments on policy advocacy, regeneration technology popularization, and regeneration case sharing. Guidance measures' effects for introversion or extraversion, regardless of region are, from large to small, incentives, regeneration case sharing, leading role of representatives, enhancing communication, policy advocacy and regeneration technology popularization. There are significant differences in the effects of enhancing external pressure measures between different personalities, and enhancing external pressure measures are more effective for extraversion. Although the differences in the effects of providing regeneration information measures are statistically insignificant, providing such measures is more effective for introversion. The results reflect the analysis of the influencing factors. TPB application is enriched and the guidance experiments used to verify guiding measures' effectiveness are provided. Practically-significant implications include: communities and proprietor committees should organize neighborhood-relationship to enhance community activities, with the proprietor committee solving residents' daily problems to win authority and trust, positively guiding residents' participation.

Yet, with the rapid development of urban renewal, the performance of existing buildings often fails to meet the actual needs of sustainable urban development. To improve the performance of existing buildings, it is urgently needed to transform the existing structures and upgrade their functions and facilities. However, the pertinent guidelines have often been unclear for assessing the performance of existing structures, and a sounder and quantitative sustainable performance assessment approach has been lacking to guide decisions on the restoration, protection, or demolition of existing buildings. Based on a multi-expert consultation methodology, we proposed a revised flexible comprehensive assessment system and a comprehensive sustainability assessment approach. The system includes 4 categories, 7 quantitative and 47 qualitative indicators. Specifically, the assessment system involves a series of steps: 1) building a hierarchical model, 2) defining assessment indicators/items and constructing a judgment matrix, 3) determining the weight coefficients of the indicators, 4) collecting/calculating quantitative and qualitative data, 5) analyzing the data and results, and 6) drawing the assessment conclusions.

However, there are few empirical studies on how perceived income level, which better measures an individual's socioeconomic status based on social comparison, affects commuting time. Using a path analysis on a 2020 dataset of Shanghai, China, this study investigates the effect of perceived income level on commuting time, and compares it with the effect of actual income level. Empirical results indicate that actual income level positively impacts perceived income level, and both significantly influence commuting time through the job-housing relationship. However, perceived income level has a negative effect on commuting time, reflecting the matching effect between the perception on socioeconomic status and commuting time. Actual income level has a positive effect on commuting time, supporting the compensation effect between objective income level and commuting time. Nevertheless, under urban development and renewal processes, individuals with lower actual incomes might extend their commuting times and resign themselves to commuting inequality due to the influence of perceived income levels.

However, current research based on economic analysis has mostly focused on qualitative statements instead of quantitative assessment. This study proposes an innovative methodology combining qualitative (field research) and quantitative (willingness to pay and contingent valuation) methods to assess the economic value of industrial heritage. The industrial heritage of Tangshan, China, was chosen as a case study, and the research found that museums and cultural creative parks are effective ways to conserve industrial heritage. The entrance fee can be used to represent the economic value of the heritage site. There was a positive correlation between the influence of economic value and the entrance fees residents would prefer to pay. The results indicate the locals would prefer lower entrance fees for the transformed heritage museums (The average current cost: $2.23). Locals were most concerned about the entrance fees for the Kailuan Coal Mine and Qixin Cement Plant Museums, which have both been renewed as urban landmarks for city tourism. Renewal methods have been applied to six industrial heritage sites in Tangshan; these sites have their own conservation and renewal practices based on city -level development or industrial attributes.

The average depth of rain in Rome during the period 1862-1877 was greater than, for example, London. In Rome there were, however, huge seasonal fluctuations in this value. There was a considerable difference in rain content between the wettest and the driest month of the year, and sometimes extremely heavy rains concentrated in just a few hours. These variations between dry summers and wet autumns/winters presented challenges to the Hydraulic Service of Rome. Since 1870, the city has experienced rapid urban growth accompanied by a process of renewal and building of new vital infrastructure, such as combined sewers, which were intended both to drain the city and to remove the city's sewage. It was, however, challenging to integrate these two different tasks into a fixed infrastructure in a city with vast seasonal variations in water flow. Rome's sewers, at times, struggled to cope with the overabundance of water during autumn and winter days with consequent flooding of the lowest parts of the city as pure water was flushed throughout the network to remove waste and sewage during the summer.

Then, a classification and recognition model based on backpropagation neural network (BPNN) is constructed, which realizes the detection and recognition of convective noise signals. The research results show that the theoretical method based on acoustic feature analysis provides guidance for the orderly and safe construction of urban natural gas pipeline network and ensures its safe operation. The research conclusion shows that through the simulation analysis of 75 groups of gas pipeline flow noise under different working conditions. Combined with the experimental verification of ground flow noise signals, the feature extraction and pattern recognition method proposed in this study has a recognition accuracy of up to 97% under strong noise background, which confirms the accuracy of numerical simulation and provides theoretical basis and technical support for the detection and recognition of urban gas pipeline flow noise.",Gas pipelines,Acoustic signals,Backpropagation neural network,Feature extraction,,"Lu, Chang","Wen, Zhaorong","Hao, Tianshu","Lu, Xudong","Wang, Lidong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a socio-technical process, renovation transforms existing architectural forms based on current housing standards. However, while a building may be composed of materials and populations, it is also the result of history, from its construction to its daily maintenance or degradation. Interpreted as such, this article posits that people with no control over their living environments are more likely to suffer from health problems, due to a lack of knowledge about underlying causes or low health literacy regarding living spaces. Consequently, their inability to adapt raises the question: How does an individual's ability to control their living space influence their health?

To address this problem, this research systematically reviews journal publications in this field from 2000 to 2023. Results disclose four research scopes: building construction, mechanical systems and equipment, electrical systems and computing, and humancentered design and connectivity, suggesting a new landscape for energy retrofit research, which largely extends beyond the traditional field of the built environment (e.g., heating, cooling, lighting, and structure) to advanced computing, renewable energy, and human-centered connectivity. Results also delineate a new paradigm of retrofit technologies with three focused areas: within-building optimizations (heating and air conditioning, envelope, engineering design, and smart technology), between-building connections (power grid, district energy, and integrated energy system), and whole-community integrations. They represent the nodes, ties, and interplay within community networks. Eight retrofit focuses and their specific technologies and computational techniques are summarized and examined.

Reusing waste CO2 to make new construction materials produces circular carbon flows and constitutes a key step toward a carbon-negative economy. To establish a holistic view of the field, this paper examines upscaled technologies with industrial deployments for utilizing CO2 in manufacturing cement-based materials and analyzes their interplay for attaining net-zero emissions (NZE) in the concrete sector. By scrutinizing the status quo, it suggests that NZE agendas should be diversified catering to the wide-ranging built products. Small-sized precast elements and lightweight components lead the way in carbon-neutral manufacturing, while the market-dominating ready-mix concrete is by far difficult to decarbonize and relies on the incorporation of pre-carbonated ingredients, preferably sourced from alkaline wastes, to leverage large-scale CO2 utilization. To expedite the race to NZE, it is necessary to combine the development of CO2 utilization and low-CO2 cement to create decarbonization strategies tailoring for individual products.

These issues are important, and Congress has frequently failed on both measures. Indeed, only about 1 million more families received housing voucher assistance in 2023 than 30 years earlier, and most of that increase replaced other types of rental assistance. Efforts to limit the overall amount of federal spending drove the reduction in new vouchers and major changes in funding policy that are the focus of this article. Congress shifted from multiyear to annual funding of housing vouchers in the mid-1990s. Aware of the challenges this shift posed for local program administration, Congress required the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to negotiate a new renewal funding rule with stakeholders but then overrode most of the rule's key components. As a result, more than 250,000 vouchers are no longer funded, about one in four public housing agencies lack the funding reserves necessary to withstand unpredictable changes in program costs, and the program is more challenging to manage.

A longitudinal study of soundscape and visual evolution and housing value fluctuations in shenzhen,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,NOV 2024,0,"The equitable evolution of neighborhood environments is closely linked to housing economics. However, the lack of quantitative and longitudinal evaluation methods makes it challenging to assess residents' neighborhood perceptions and achieve social inclusiveness goals. Using long-time series street view imagery, we quantified Shenzhen residents' multidimensional neighborhood perceptions before and after micro-renovations, including visual and soundscape dimensions, and revealed the association between perceptual evolution and the housing value. We identified inequitable results during neighborhood renewal: Neighborhoods with high soundscape scores are accompanied by low visual perception scores, and vice versa. The spatial inequality is reflected in the perceptual differentiation prevalent between urban and suburbs. Visual aspects showed a stable but weak relationship with housing value fluctuations, while soundscape aspects had a strong but more dynamic impact. The inequitable spatial evolution is facilitated by changes in residents' perceptions: expectations for positive audio-visual perceptions are increasing, but sensitivity for negative soundscape is decreasing. Meanwhile, residents are increasingly seeking diverse and rich visual neighborhood landscapes and atmospheres filled with human voices. This study provides quantitative support for the equitable evolution of neighborhoods and the economics of neighborhood landscapes.

The purpose of this study is to summarize typical building models for primary and secondary schools in Hainan Province, and to use software to simulate and calculate the photovoltaic utilization potential of primary and secondary school buildings. In China, the government is usually the manager of primary and secondary schools, and due to their architectural characteristics, these buildings can be used to assess photovoltaic applications. The aim is to drive the application of photovoltaic systems in all types of buildings and promote urban energy reform. This study summarizes the types of primary and secondary school buildings in Hainan Province and analyzes them. It evaluates rooftop photovoltaic projects at the Second Middle School and the Siyuan School in Wanning City, Hainan Province, and uses PVsyst 7.2 software to assess the photovoltaic utilization potential. The results show that the optimal orientation in Hainan Province is south-facing, and the optimal inclination angle is 10 degrees to 20 degrees. The most favorable orientations of facade photovoltaic systems are 20 degrees southeast or southwest. The longest dynamic investment payback period is approximately 15 years, and the environmental benefits are $0.012/kWh.

The commonly used thresholding and change detection methods in emergency monitoring can quickly and simply detect floods. However, these methods still have some problems: (1) thresholding methods are easily affected by low backscattering regions and speckle noise; (2) changes from multi-temporal information include urban renewal and seasonal variation, reducing the precision of flood monitoring. To solve these problems, this paper presents a new flood mapping framework that combines semi-automatic thresholding and change detection. First, multiple lines across land and water are drawn manually, and their local optimal thresholds are calculated automatically along these lines from two ends towards the middle. Using the average of these thresholds, the low backscattering regions are extracted to generate a preliminary inundation map. Then, the neighborhood-based change detection method combined with entropy thresholding is adopted to detect the changed areas. Finally, pixels in both the low backscattering regions and the changed regions are marked as inundated terrain.

The gasoline car without the GPF emitted relatively high concentrations of particles compared to the other technologies but the implementation of the GPF decreased particle emissions, and the potential to form secondary aerosols in atmospheric processes. The diesel car equipped with the DPF emitted low particle number concentrations except during the DPF regeneration events.

However, with the extensive construction of infrastructure and rapid expansion of cities, the road updating process is imperative to maintain the high quality of current basic geographic information. Currently, road extraction and change detection are two commonly used methods to solve road updating problems. Most of the existing methods rely on a large number of accurate road labels to generate road information while ignoring the use of quantities of available but incomplete road maps. In our work, we proposed a semisupervised road extraction method specifically for road-updating applications [semi-supervised road updating network (SRUNet)]. In this approach, historical road maps are fused with the latest remote sensing images, and the state of the roads is updated directly. A multibranch network is the core of the method, which consists of three noteworthy parts: the map encoding branch (MEB) proposed for representation learning, the boundary enhancement module (BEM) for improving the accuracy of boundary prediction, and the residual refinement module (RRM) for further optimizing the prediction results. We applied our method to two datasets: the DeepGlobe public dataset and our self-constructed dataset from Zhengzhou and Nanjing. Experimental results show that our method achieves an improvement of 14.37% over the baseline approach. Notably, the addition of historical maps improved the model's performance by 12.4%.

The authors rely on proprietary data obtained from an MF institution for the period from Nov 2019 to Dec 2020. The authors show that default increased to 95.29% in the month of April 2020, when Covid lockdowns were fully in place. However, borrowers bounced back thereafter, either making full or partial payments, so that defaults had fallen to 5.92% by December 2020. Static features of the group lending model like peer monitoring and joint liability help explain 90% of the monthly deficit during Covid lockdowns among uneducated borrowers. Dynamic features such as contingent renewal help explain why defaults were cured quickly through timely repayments. Finally, there is an absence of default contagion at the district level. Indeed, lagged own default explains 96.6% of variation in individual default, rather than contagion through group, village or district-level defaults. The authors conclude that the MF sector is resilient to exogenous shocks like the pandemic.Design/methodology/approachThe authors use time series panel regressions, as well as cross-sectional regressions.FindingsThe authors find that borrower defaults increased significantly to 95.29% during the month of April 2020, when Covid lockdowns were fully in place. However, borrowers bounced back almost immediately, either making full or partial payments, such that defaults had fallen to 5.92% by December 2020. The group lending model does remarkably well in explaining defaults even during Covid lockdowns. Among the majority (92%) of borrowers who are residents of rural districts, the group lending model appears to blunt the impact of the exogenous shock on rates of default. Indeed, panel regressions demonstrate that the group lending model helps explain 90% of the monthly deficit among uneducated borrowers. Logistic regressions indicate that the group lending model is less persuasive among relatively affluent borrowers residing in semi-urban or urban areas who have some formal schooling. Contingent renewal is shown to be an effective disciplining mechanism when a group does default due to the Covid lockdowns. The authors find that groups who defaulted in April 2020 but repaid the outstanding balance within the next two months were more likely to receive subsequent loans from the lender. On the other hand, groups who defaulted in April 2020 and did not repay the outstanding balance until December 2020 did not receive follow-on financing. Finally, the authors find that lagged individual default is the primary source of individual default, rather than contagion through group, village or district-level defaults.Research limitations/implicationsThe limitation of the study is that it is confined to a single MF institution in India.Social implicationsThe authors conclude that the social capital that is the foundation of the group lending model succeeds in limiting both the risk and contagion of default from an exogenous shock, such as the Covid pandemic.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, the authors are the first to examine defaults in the Indian MF sector during the Covid lockdowns in April 2020.",Microfinance,Covid pandemic,Group lending,Default,Contagion,"Ascioglu, Asli",,,,,G01,G21,G15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Variations in metal and metalloid concentrations across sites were observed, with P3 exhibiting higher levels in fresh mussels for most elements, except for As, which was higher at P2 (0.35 +/- 0.45 mg kg(-1)). Cooked samples demonstrated similar trends for Cu (1.30 +/- 0.39 mg kg(-1)), Ni (0.28 +/- 0.20 mg kg(-1)), and V (0.75 +/- 0.28 mg/kg(-1)), indicating that cooking in contaminanted estuary water does not significantly reduce contamination. Significant differences were detected for Ni, Cd (0.014 +/- 0.008 mg kg(-1)), Zn (14.28 +/- 2.50 mg kg(-1)), and V at P1, which were significantly higher than at P3. Significant Fe (246 +/- 68 mg kg(-1)), Al (109 +/- 33 mg kg(-1)), and Mn increases were observed from P1 to P3. Mussels sampled from P3, near an abandoned military area and urban center, exhibited high Fe and Al levels, attributed to both natural processes and industrial activities. Metal concentrations in Charu mussels often exceeded regulatory limits set by Brazilian, North American, and European agencies. Calculated Se molar ratios indicate that while Se can mitigate Hg toxicity, high Hg levels in Sepetiba Bay 's Charu mussels still pose significant health risks. Similarly, high levels of Ag, Cd, and Pb suggest ineffective Se protection. However, Se appears effective against As toxicity. The Health Benefit Value of Selenium (HBVSe) indicate Se 's overall protective benefits against Hg toxicity. Higher HBVSe values in cooked mussels at P1 and P2 suggest that cooking increases Se bioavailability. However, raw mussels at P3 had higher HBVSe values than cooked ones, highlighting the need for site-specific assessments.

The expansion of rural cycling infrastructure is frequently described as transformative for rural communities, contributing to economic renewal, while also enhancing quality of life and environmental sustainability. Yet rural communities sometimes meet these projects with skepticism or resistance due to concerns about increased presence of outsiders, crime, and changes in the economic and cultural orientations of the community. This contrast between the transformational promise of new cycling infrastructure and the more mixed reactions at the local level suggest a need for holistic examination of the connections between cycling infrastructure and rural sustainability transformations.

Neurotrauma is the primary reason for neurosurgical intervention but is poorly managed due to delayed access and insufficient guidelines. The neurosurgical education system is strained by limited training capacity and the absence of subspecializations, restricting specialized care. Research output is low, hindered by limited infrastructure, lack of databases, insufficient funding, and minimal international collaboration. To address these issues, it is critical to enhance the imaging capabilities, ensure the availability of operative equipment, and establish effective policies for task sharing and communication at different levels of care. Other approaches include expanding training capacity, particularly in rural areas, implementing a uniform match system for residency, addressing gender disparities, and utilizing dual practice to ensure adequate compensation for neurosurgeons. Furthermore, stakeholders should develop subspecialization programs in areas such as neurovascular, neuro-oncology, pediatric neurosurgery, and minimally invasive neurosurgery to expand service scope. To transform the neurosurgical research landscape, efforts should be made to establish electronic medical databases, foster international collaborations to ensure funding, and make research mandatory for accreditation renewal to ensure continuous academic contribution.",Academic neurosurgery,Global neurosurgery,Nigeria,Research,,"Ajayi, Abass Oluwaseyi","Ansari, Ayesha","Mustapha, Mubarak Jolayemi","Verma, Amogh","Adinoyi, Suleiman Abdullahi",,,,,,"Uthman, Uthman",,"Usman, Abubakar","Mofatteh, Mohammad","Khatib, Mahalaqua Nazli","Zahiruddin, Quazi Syed","Gaidhane, Shilpa","Sharma, Rakesh Kumar",,,,,"Rustagi, Sarvesh","Satapathy, Prakasini","Ajibade, Aruna Afeez","Oluwamayowa, Opara","Obanife, Henry Olayere","Ahmad, Karofi Ibrahim","Ogunleye, Olabisi Oluwagbemiga",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, environmental reviews often overlook the vulnerability of older adults, and an age-friendly community parks survey (AF-CPS) is lacking. This study developed a comprehensive assessment system, the AF-CPS. The research process was divided into three phases covering eight dimensions: a. humanistic environment (e.g., participation in the green space environment and in cultural exchange); b. infrastructure (e.g., edutainment, medical, and sports facilities); c. recreation comfort (e.g., atmospheric conditions, noise environment, trail comfortableness); d. site planning (e.g., spatial layout, activity space diversity); e. environmental quality (e.g., plant richness, latitude of vision); f. barrier-free environment (e. g., barrier-free site identification,barrier-free service facilities and barrier-free functional facilities); g. environmental maintenance (e.g., participation in building policy decisions, landscape maintenance management); and h. security management. The establishment of the evaluation system was based on a literature review. During the verification and modification of the model, an on-site investigation and questionnaire survey were conducted with elderly individuals (60+) in a community park to identify an evaluation system that can be used as a research tool to promote the construction and renewal of an aging-friendly environment in community parks.",Community parks,Environment evaluation,Older adults,Survey tool,,"Mei, Taoming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the essential characteristics of evolutionary resilience, this paper developed an ecological resilience index system of ""resistance-recovery-reconstruction-renewal"" and calculated the ecological resilience of 75 prefecture-level cities in the Yellow River Basin from 2007 to 2021 with the improved TOPSIS method. Then the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of ecological resilience were analyzed using the gravity center-standard deviation ellipse, Dagum Gini coefficient decomposition, and spatial autocorrelation analysis. Furthermore, the dynamic spatial Durbin model (DSDM) was used to investigate the influencing factors of ecological resilience. The main results are as follows: (1) The ecological resilience of the Yellow River Basin showed an overall fluctuating upward trend, and the average annual growth rate in the downstream region was larger than in the upstream and midstream regions. (2) Cities with similar levels of ecological resilience were distributed in a ""large settlement, small scattered"" pattern. The center of gravity shifted to the southeast, and the spatial distribution exhibited a ""northwest-southeast"" pattern and a trend towards an ""east-west"" pattern. The primary source of spatial differences was the intensity of transvariation. (3) The ecological resilience in the Yellow River Basin showed significant spatial clustering, with the H-H clustering area shifting from the Hubao-Eyu urban agglomeration to the Shandong Peninsula urban agglomeration, and the L-L clustering area mainly distributed around the Central Plains city cluster. (4) The ecological resilience of the Yellow River Basin exhibited significant snowball, spillover, and siphon effects in time, space, and space-time dimensions, respectively. In the short and long term, population density and openness significantly positively affected the ecological resilience of local and surrounding cities. Urbanization had a long-term effect on ecological resilience without a short-term effect. GDP per capita and industrial structure only imparted a significant positive influence on local ecological resilience. The negative spatial spillover of the intensity of financial investment in technological innovation gradually turned into a positive effect.",,,,,,"Liu, Qi","Wang, Pengcheng",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite economic downturns and the rise of alternative transportation towards the end of the last century, canals have been experiencing a resurgence in recent years, driven by the principles of sustainable development. To gain a deeper understanding of global academic research focus and current trends, this paper systematically reviews publications related to canal-related industrial buildings from 1997 to 22 January 2024. Using the bibliometric software CiteSpace 6.3.1, information such as countries, institutions, authors, keywords, and references from 96 selected articles in the Web of Science (WoS) database was visualized and analyzed. The results reveal that the current research hotspots in this field mainly focus on five clusters: ""stakeholders"", ""green spaces"", ""conservation areas"", ""industrial heritage"", and ""energy-efficient reconstruction"". The most popular research topics concerning canal-related industrial buildings are ""urban renewal"", ""industrial heritage"", ""climate change"", and ""heritage tourism"", with most themes closely linked to sustainable development. However, it is observed that there is still a lack of a systematic research framework in this field. Most studies originate from heritage management and conservation, landscape rejuvenation along canals, and canal water resource management, while systematic research on canal-related industrial buildings remains limited. Based on these findings, this study proposes future trends and potential research directions in this field, aiming to provide researchers with a comprehensive understanding of the status and to support the sustainable preservation and management of industrial buildings and heritage along canals with a more systematic research framework.",canal,industrial heritage,industrial buildings,bibliometric analysis,,"Fan, Xiaoli",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Various facilities such as skate parks, city stadiums, street workout zones, fitness areas, multisport courts, and fitness trails are designed to encourage people to engage in sports and/or physical activities. Between 2018 and 2020, the state-via the CNDS (National Center for the Development of Sport) and then the National Sports Agency-funded 467 local sports facilities for a total amount of 19.9 million euros. The majority of the funded projects were multisport courts (72 percent). More recently, the ""5,000 Sports Fields"" plan was introduced to support this growing dynamic. To shed light on this subject, it is necessary to structure an analytical research approach. In this approach, we will attempt to identify the specific uses of freely accessible sports and/or physical activity spaces in the Lille metropolitan area (access methods, attendance, duration and types of practice, user characteristics, motivations for participation) in order to identify the role(s) they play today in the renewal of forms of urban expression (Augustin 1999). Observing practices and listening to needs play a fundamental role when it comes to diagnosing, programming, designing, and evaluating public spaces. In our study, we conducted in situ ethnographic observations, administered questionnaires, and conducted semi-structured interviews with elected officials and the technical staff in charge of setting up these facilities.

However, most existing research has focused more on urban buildings, with less attention given to rural residences. This study, taking rural residential buildings (RRBs) in the hot summer and cold winter zones in China as an example, proposes a more precise, two-stage optimization design framework using Rhino-Grasshopper for the overall optimization of RRBs. First, field surveys and numerical analysis of collected rural residential design drawings were conducted to clarify spatial characteristics and air conditioning usage. The parametric optimization design of RRBs was then conducted in two steps. The first step involves room function positioning, where spatial geometric models are established. Annual dynamic simulation analyses of AC (air conditioning) and AL (artificial lighting) energy consumption are performed to obtain energy intensity distribution maps. Based on the principle that ""space with higher energy consumption is set in the location with lower energy consumption intensity"" and the habit of functional space distribution, room function positioning, and adjustments are made. In the second step, the SPEA-2 genetic algorithm was applied for multi-objective optimization of room width, depth, WWR (window-to-wall ratio), SHGC (solar heat gain coefficient), and VLT (visible light transmittance), all based on the logical relationships of the building structure. The final Pareto front solution sets were obtained by multi-objective optimization simulation (MOO). A typical three-bay RRB was selected for application in this study, and the optimized design led to a total energy savings rate of 11% in annual AC and AL energy consumption.",rural residential design,building performance optimization,parametric design method,building plan layout,hot summer and cold winter zone,"Xu, Ying","Shen, Runtian","Wu, Yun",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Row_306,"Wang, Boyu",Omni-Scan2BIM: A ready-to-use Scan2BIM approach based on vision foundation models for MEP scenes,AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION,JUN 2024,0,"Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) systems play a crucial role in providing various services and creating comfortable environments for urban residents. In order to enhance the management efficiency of these highly complex MEP systems, as-built building information models (BIMs) are being increasingly adopted worldwide. As-built BIMs accurately represent the actual conditions of facilities, making as-built BIM reconstruction significantly important for construction progress tracking, quality assurance, subsequent facility management, and renewal. To create as-built BIMs for MEP systems, laser scanners are widely utilized to capture highresolution images and dense 3D measurements of the environment in a fast and highly accurate manner. Despite research efforts to automatically achieve ""Scan-to-BIM,"" there are still gaps in applying current solutions to real-world scenarios. One of the major challenges are the limited generalization of existing methods to unseen scenarios without proper training or fine-tuning on custom-designed datasets. To address this issue, this study introduces Omni-Scan2BIM, a novel approach powered by large-scale pre-trained vision foundation models. Omni-Scan2BIM enables the recognition of MEP-related components with a single shot by integrating an allpurpose feature extraction model and a class-agnostic segmentation model. Firstly, given only a single image with a reference mask, the visual features are extracted for both the target component and the collected on-site images using the vision foundation model DINOv2. Secondly, through comparing pixel features, similarity maps are generated for the on-site images. The prior points for the class-agnostic segmentation model are sampled from the local maxima of the similarity map. Thirdly, Segment Anything Model (SAM) is leveraged to sequentially segment the target component. Finally, the target component is segmented out in 3D space based on the transformation matrix describing the spatial relationship between the 2D images and the 3D point clouds. Shape analysis and label fusion are conducted for as-built BIM modeling purpose. To validate the feasibility of the proposed technique, experiments were conducted using data collected from a real construction site in Hong Kong. The results demonstrate that the proposed Omni-Scan2BIM approach can easily generalize to unseen components with significantly improved accuracy and efficiency.",Scan-to-BIM,Building information model (BIM),Point clouds,As-built modeling,Vision foundation model,"Chen, Zhengyi","Li, Mingkai","Wang, Qian","Yin, Chao","Cheng, Jack C.

However, the translation of MSC-based Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs) into the clinic has frequently met with inconsistent outcomes. One of the suspected reasons for this issue is the inherent and extensive variability that exists among such ATMPs, which makes the interpretation of their clinical efficacy difficult to assess, as well as to compare the results of various studies. This variability stems from numerous reasons including differences in tissue sources, donor attributes, variances in manufacturing protocols, as well as modes of administration. MSCs can be isolated from various tissues including bone marrow, umbilical cord, adipose tissue and others, each with its unique phenotypic and functional characteristics. While MSCs from different sources do share common features, they also exhibit distinct gene expression profiles and functional properites. Donor-specific factors such as age, sex, body mass index, and underlying health conditions can influence MSC phenotype, morphology, differentiation potential and function. Moreover, variations in preparation of MSC products introduces additional heterogeneity as a result of cell culture media composition, presence or absence of added growth factors, use of different serum supplements and culturing techniques. Once MSC products are formulated, storage protocols play a pivotal role in its efficacy. Factors that affect cell viability include cell concentration, delivery solution and importantly, post-thawing protocols where applicable. Ensuing, differences in administration protocols can critically affect the distribution and functionallity of administered cells. As MSC-based therapies continue to advance through numerous clinical trials, implication of strategies to reduce product heterogeneity is imperative. Central to addressing these challenges is the need for precise prediction of clinical responses, which require well-defined MSC populations and harmonized assessment of their specific functions. By addressing these issues by meaningful approaches, such as, e.g., MSC pooling, the field can overcome barriers to advance towards more consistent and effective MSC-based therapies.",mesenchymal stromal (stem) cell,heterogeneity,pooling,equipotency,advanced therapy medicinal product (ATMP),"Svajger, Urban",,,,,cell therapy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stakeholders in engineering projects must seriously consider these vital issues. Existing studies on the evaluation of engineering-ecology sustainable development capacity mainly focus on the regional and industry levels, with less research focusing on the sustainability of individual engineering projects; furthermore, they are primarily concentrated on the qualitative evaluation perspective. In order to refine these shortcomings, based on the viewpoint of the ecosystem of construction projects, this paper integrates the concept of whole life cycle with the ecological footprint measurement model and defines the notion of the ecological footprint of the whole life cycle of construction projects. Subsequently taking the above concept as the foundation and making the ecological footprint of various activities throughout the life cycle of a construction project a specific study object, the research establishes the ecological footprint measurement model of the whole life cycle of the project, and comprehensively evaluates the impacts on the surrounding environment, which include the consumption of energy resources, CO2 and the absorption of solid wastes across the whole life cycle of the project. We then measure the sustainable development ability of engineering projects by comparing the ecological footprint with the ecological carrying capacity of a certain surrounding region. Finally, the practicability and reliability of the model is verified through the example's application. Thus, the results of the study have significant theoretical and practical implications: (1) the introduction of the ecological footprint addresses the gap about the quantitative evaluation of the sustainability of individual engineering projects from a micro perspective; (2) it compensates for the shortcomings of other evaluation methods that only evaluate a single element, such as only CO2, resources, energy or solid waste and so on; and (3) stakeholders can use the measured model to quantitatively assess the sustainability of new projects or urban renewal projects, providing strong support for project feasibility studies and project-establishment.",construction project,engineering ecosystem,whole life cycle,ecological footprint measurement modeling,ecological carrying ability,"Li, Xiaojuan","Yu, Liyan","Jin, Jianqiang","Liang, Xian",,sustainability,stakeholders,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It requires the active involvement of residents and efficient management by organizers. To improve the effectiveness of resident participation, it is necessary to understand the critical success factors (CSFs) underlying it. However, previous research has examined the critical factors from a single-stakeholder perspective, overlooking potential differences in perceptions among stakeholders with diverse roles and rehabilitation experiences. Based on 30 interviews and 255 questionnaires from six stakeholder groups in Wuhan, China, this study explores how the perception of critical factors for effective resident participation varies among local government, community-based organization, designer, contractor, consulting party, and resident. Thirty-seven factors were identified and compared among the stakeholders. Financial Incentive (for participation organizers) was identified as the most critical factor for effective resident participation, followed by Information Disclosure and Transparency, and Trust. Results from the analysis of variance (ANOVA) show that the six groups differed significantly in the importance of most factors (25/37), especially in Participant Education and Prejudice against the Working Group. Interview results indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic and rehabilitation experience changed stakeholders' perceived importance of some factors.

Row_314,"Schuerings, Christian",River ecological status is shaped by agricultural land use intensity across Europe,WATER RESEARCH,MAR 1 2024,8,"Agriculture impacts the ecological status of freshwaters through multiple pressures such as diffuse pollution, water abstraction, and hydromorphological alteration, strongly impairing riverine biodiversity. The agricultural effects, however, likely differ between agricultural types and practices. In Europe, agricultural types show distinct spatial patterns related to intensity, biophysical conditions, and socioeconomic history, which have been operationalised by various landscape typologies. Our study aimed at analysing whether incorporating agricultural intensity enhances the correlation between agricultural land use and the ecological status. For this, we aggregated the continent's agricultural activities into 20 Areas of Farming-induced Freshwater Pressures (AFFP), specifying individual pressure profiles regarding nutrient enrichment, pesticides, water abstraction, and agricultural land use in the riparian zone to establish an agricultural intensity index and related this intensity index to the river ecological status. Using the agricultural intensity index, nearly doubled the correlative strength between agriculture and the ecological status of rivers as compared to the share of agriculture in the subcatchment (based on the analysis of more than 50,000 sub-catchment units).

Because of the lack of ER, PR or HER2 expression in TNBC, there are limited options for tailored therapies. While TNBCs respond initially to standard of care chemotherapy, tumor recurrence commonly occurs within 1 to 3 years post-chemotherapy and is associated with early organ metastasis and a high incidence of mortality. One of the major mechanisms responsible for drug resistance and emergence of organ metastasis is activation of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) reprogramming. EMT-mediated cancer cell plasticity also promotes the enrichment of cancer cells with a CD44high/CD24low and/or ALDHhigh cancer stem-like phenotype [cancer stem cells (CSCs)], characterized by an increased capacity for tumor self-renewal, intrinsic drug resistance, immune evasion and metastasis. In this study we demonstrate for the first time a positive feedback loop between AURKA and intra-tumoral PD-L1 oncogenic pathways in TNBC. Genetic targeting of intra-tumoral PD-L1 expression impairs the enrichment of ALDHhigh CSCs and enhances the therapeutic efficacy of AURKA-targeted therapy. Moreover, dual AURKA and PD-L1 pharmacological blockade resulted in the strongest inhibition of tumor growth and organ metastatic burden. Taken together, our findings provide a compelling preclinical rationale for the development of novel combinatorial therapeutic strategies aimed to inhibit cancer cell plasticity, immune evasion capacity and organ metastasis in patients with advanced TNBC.",triple negative breast cancer,immunotherapy,cancer cell plasticity,small molecule inhibitor,organ metastases,"Zhang, Minzhi","Jalalirad, Mohammad","Ferre, Roberto Leon","Shrestha, Royal","Haddad, Tufia",,,,,,"Sarkaria, Jann",,"Tuma, Ann","Carter, Jodi","David, Hillman","Giridhar, Karthik","Wang, Liewei","Lange, Carol",,,,,"Lendahl, Urban","Ingle, James","Goetz, Matthew","D'Assoro, Antonino Bonaventura",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the impact of this complex mechanical environment on the dynamic characteristics of roof sandstone in self-formed roadways without coal pillars, standard specimens of deep sandstone from the 2611 upper tunnel working face of the Yongmei Company within the Henan Coal Chemical Industry Group in Henan, China were prepared, and an orthogonal test was designed. Using a self-developed geotechnical dynamic impact mechanics test system, triaxial dynamic impact tests under thermal-hydraulic-mechanical coupling conditions were conducted on deep sandstone. The results indicate that under high confining pressure, deep sandstone exhibits pronounced brittle failure at low temperatures, with peak strength gradually decreasing as temperature and osmotic water pressure increase. Conversely, under low confining pressure and low temperature, the brittleness of deep sandstone weakens gradually, while ductility increases. Moreover, sandstone demonstrates higher peak strength at low temperatures under high axial pressure conditions, lower peak strength at high temperatures, and greater strain under low axial pressure and high osmotic water pressure. Increases in impact air pressure and osmotic water pressure have proportionally greater effects on peak stress and peak strain. Approximately 50% of the input strain energy is utilized as effective energy driving the sandstone fracture process. Polar analysis identifies the optimal combination of factors affecting the peak stress and peak strain of sandstone. Under the coupling effect, intergranular and transgranular fractures occur within the sandstone.

Existing research conducted on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform has overwhelmingly focused on pixel-based LULC classification techniques, often neglecting the role of spatial context via neighbouring valuable pixel information. Remarkably, little attention has been paid to the amalgamation of 3 x 3 neighbouring pixels into a threedimensional space -spectrum array that can emulate the functionalities of object-based image analysis. In this study, we developed a novel integrated model consisting of a space -spectrum array (SSA) model based on 3 x 3 neighbouring pixels, a tile model based on random forest, and a multiple probabilistic classification model (SSATPRF) on the GEE platform to generate a LULC map with high overall accuracy (OA) for Ordos in 2020. Three bimonthly median value images were synthesised and feature collections, including spectral bands and vegetation indices, were constructed. Five experimental groups (EXP1 -EXP5) were used to assess the different model combinations. Subsequent validation procedures employed abundant reference samples and compared the results with those of the three extant LULC mapping products. The results showed that EXP2, which was grounded in the tile-based model, yielded an OA of 87.53%, surpassing that of EXP1 (84.99%), which employed a traditional overall model. Furthermore, EXP3, which integrated the multiple probabilistic classification model with the traditional overall model, exhibited an OA of 85.19%, exceeding that of EXP1. A comparison of the five experimental groups using the four regional spatial subtlety features revealed that the EXP5, employing the SSATPRF model, successfully decreased the salt and pepper noise. The OA of six tile sizes ranging from 10 km to 100 km were compared, and the highest OA (88.35%) was achieved at a tile size of 25 km. The resultant LULC map in Ordos, derived from the SSA-TPRF model, showed superior OA compared with the extant LULC products. This study thus contributes to a versatile and scalable model within the GEE framework, offering avenues for facile adaptation and recurrent application across disparate geographical locations and temporal settings. The adaptability of this model is particularly advantageous for developing nations and regions typified by diverse landscapes, thereby catalysing the iterative updating of LULC maps through advanced remote-sensing paradigms.",Arid zone,LULC,Tile,Multiple probabilistic classification,Space-spectrum array,"Fan, Liangxin","Zhang, Chengkang","Xue, Sha",,,Random forest,Google earth engine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Traditional evaluation methods, including laboratory virtual reality (VR) experiments and computer simulations, have their respective advantages in accuracy or cost-efficiency. However, they either suffer from high costs and low efficiency or sacrifice the diversity of behavioral data for higher efficiency and lower costs. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel method named ""sampling as simulation"" (SaS) via an online VR wayfinding experiment. This method allows for the rapid collection of behavioral data at a lower cost to generate highly accurate wayfinding trajectory data for evaluation purposes. It utilizes a model-image integrated approach to create realistic online virtual environments and employs a spatiotemporal replay algorithm to generate a crowd of true-trajectory-driven avatars, significantly enhancing the immersion and realism of the online virtual scenes. This method was demonstrated and validated with a wayfinding performance post-occupancy evaluation (POE) project at the International Departure of Satellite Terminal One (S1) in Shanghai Pudong International Airport (PVG). In this example, a total of 13,712 original trajectories were collected within a 72-h time window, serving as the original dataset for evaluation. Based on this dataset, the study effectively simulated wayfinding behavior in three different scenarios and evaluated wayfinding performance.

Controlling the use of fertilizers and pesticides in crop cultivation is therefore necessary and has been adopted as an action plan since 2015 in China. However, the effects of fertilizer and pesticide reductions have not been systematically investigated. This paper explores how yields and land use for rice, wheat, corn, and soybean cultivation shift when reducing their fertilizer and pesticide inputs using China's provincial crop-land integrated partial equilibrium model (the CPMCL model). Simulation results for different scenarios show that, among the studied crops, rice and wheat exhibit greater adaptability than corn and soybeans. Reducing the use of fertilizers and pesticides within the interval from 0% to 3.5% may increase the total demand of land resources for crop production from 0.220% to 4.21%. Limited land resources will be allocated to more profitable crops to maximize output, which means the land use for wheat production may increase over 20% while for rice, corn and soybean may decrease around 4% under the shock of fertilizer and pesticide reductions. Merely reducing fertilizer and pesticide inputs in crop cultivation may exacerbate the conflict between crop production and land resource conservation in China, which means the technology and efficiency of fertilizer and pesticide use needs to be improved. The findings of this paper can help formulate more province-specific and crop-targeted plans to properly reduce fertilizer and pesticide use, thus promoting sustainable land use while ensuring food security and protecting the environment.",Fertilizer and pesticide reductions,Land use,Crop production,Crop -land Integrated Partial Equilibrium Model,China,"Liu, Yu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, it is imperative to gain a profound understanding of the dynamic mechanical responses that rock bodies exhibit during tunnel construction. This study adopted the developed shield disc cutter model, combined with actual geological parameter conditions of shield tunnel projects, to apply different impact pressures to three groups of rock bodies using the cutter model. The major objective is to investigate the dynamic mechanical behavior of the rock under up to 20 successive impacts by shield disc cutters. The experimental findings unveil that at identical impact pressures, as the number of impacts increased, there was a gradual escalation in the peak amplitude of the wave reflected from the rock, accompanied by a simultaneous reduction in the peak amplitude of the transmitted wave. This phenomenon indicates the accumulation of internal damage within the rock form successive impacts, resulting in a diminished capacity of the rock to withstand external impact loads. Furthermore, the dynamic modulus of the rock displayed an initial increase followed by a subsequent decrease in response to successive impact disturbances, with a critical point emerging at approximately 15 successive impacts. Moreover, key parameters such as peak stress, peak strain, and loading rate exhibited notable dependencies on impact rate, effectively characterized by a proposed statistical regression formula under typical confining pressure conditions.

Accurate predictions of the GMB hole leakage and CGCW performance are essential for engineering design and cost control. This paper establishes empirical equations to predict the leakages through the CGCWs based on the numerical models. Additionally, an analytical solution for contaminant migration through the CGCW is proposed considering the effects of GMB holes. The accuracy of the established equations and analytical solution is verified by the numerical models. The key effects of the GMB thickness (TG), head loss (HG), cut-off wall hydraulic conductivity (kG), hole radius (rG) and shape on the leakage and CGCW performance are investigated. The results show that compared with other hole shapes, the leakage through the circular hole is lowest. This is mainly because the shape factor for the circular hole is 1.15-1.3 times lower than that for other shapes of holes with the same area. Additionally, the effects of the hole geometric properties and head loss on the CGCW performance can be more significant when the cut-off wall hydraulic coefficient is small. For example, the breakthrough time differences between the cases with rG = 0.005 m and 0.05 m are 0.8 and 5.0 years when kG = 10-10 and 10-9 m/s, respectively.

The whole structural nodal coding system is condensed by replacing the two codes at the beam end nodes with code at the hinge point based on the traditional space rigid frame matrix displacement method. On the basis of the principle of virtual work, the system natural vibration equation of the structure in the condensed nodal coding system is obtained; from the mode-superposition response spectrum method and the time history analysis method, the system seismic response equation of the structure in the condensed nodal coding system is derived. Then, the dynamic behaviour and seismic performance of the structure can be achieved by solving the obtained system dynamic equations. Finally, two numerical examples, a space L-shaped articulated reciprocal rigid frame and a reciprocal configuration transformed from the 36 type of Archimedes paving, are adopted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. From the numerical results, the reciprocal structure transformed from the 36 type of Archimedes paving has a large whole stiffness, and the seismic response generated by vertical earthquake excitation is the most significant, which should be the focus of the seismic design of reciprocal structures.

However, prolonged indoor living limits individuals' exposure to nature, potentially hindering the timely alleviation of stress and fatigue induced by work. While biophilic design is recognized as a potential solution, its impact on the restoration process has not been extensively studied, particularly in relation to its various design patterns. Therefore, it is important to determine the restorative effects of different patterns of biophilic design and their combination in order to guide the practical application of biophilic design. In this study, the effects of two typical biophilic design patterns and their combination on attention restoration were measured using subjective scales, cognitive tasks, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in a simulated real workspace. The results suggest a significant enhancement in the restorative impact on cognitive performance and physiological benefits when combining two biophilic design patterns, while a single design pattern does not yield the same effect. These findings contribute to a better understanding and improvement of workspaces, enhancing users' experience and well-being.",biophilic design,restorative environment,attention restoration,workspace,functional near-infrared spectroscopy,"Yu, Zhengqi","Hou, Guoying","Shu, Ping","Bo, Yunque","Shi, Yankun",,,,,,"Nie, Rui",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Row_336,"Hu, Hongqiang",Non-parametric fragility curves for probabilistic risk assessment of rainfall-triggered landslides,COMPUTERS AND GEOTECHNICS,SEP 2024,1,"Fragility analysis of slopes under rainfall condition express the conditional probabilities of exceeding prescribed slope limit states under a range of rainfall intensities, which is the basic and pivotal procedure in rainfalltriggered landslide risk assessment. Classical fragility analysis methods of slopes always develop fragility curves with the assumption of lognormal distribution. The validation of assuming the shape of fragility curves as lognormal distribution remains a open question in practice. In addition, the existing fragility analysis of slopes under rainfall condition have not dealt with the effect of spatially-variable geo-material parameters. In the present study, a novel fragility analysis methodology is proposed for the construction of non-parametric fragility curves of slopes under rainfall condition, in which the spatially-variable soil properties are taken into account. The non-parametric fragility curves are developed by the calculated slope failure probabilities under various rainfall intensities on the basis of probability density evolution theory, without restricting fragility functions to some assumed distribution models. With the proposed method and a set of probabilistic slope rainfall seepage and stability analyses, non-parametric fragility curves, fragility surface using two rainfall intensity measures and time-dependent fragility curves of a slope subjected to various rainfall scenarios are obtained for rainfalltriggered landslides risk assessment.",Landslide risk assessment,Fragility curves,Slope stability,Probability density evolution theory,Rainfall,"Bao, Yangjuan","Han, Xu","Wang, Wenwen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Row_337,"Wu, Xiao-ni",Experimental Study on Engineering Behavior of Solidified Soil for Scour Repair and Protection,CHINA OCEAN ENGINEERING,AUG 2024,0,"A new scour countermeasure using solidified slurry for offshore foundation has been proposed recently. Fluidized solidified slurry is pumped to seabed area around foundation for scour protection or pumped into the developed scour holes for scour repair as the fluidized material solidifies gradually. In the pumping operation and solidification, the engineering behaviors of solidified slurry require to be considered synthetically for the reliable application in scour repair and protection of ocean engineering such as the pumpability related flow value, flow diffusion behavior related rheological property, anti-scour performance related retention rate in solidification and bearing capacity related strength property after solidification. In this study, a series of laboratory tests are conducted to investigate the effects of mix proportion (initial water content and binder content) on the flow value, rheological properties, density, retention rate of solidified slurry and unconfined compressive strength (UCS). The results reveal that the flow value increases with the water content and decreases with the binder amount. All the solidified slurry exhibits Bingham plastic behavior when the shear rate is larger than 5 s-1. The Bingham model has been employed to fit the rheology test results, and empirical formulas for obtaining the density, yield stress and viscosity are established, providing scientific support for the numerical assessment of flow and diffusion of solidified slurry. Retention rate of solidified slurry decreases with the water flow velocity and flow value, which means the pumpability of solidified slurry is contrary to anti-scour performance. The unconfined compressive strength after solidification reduces as the water content increases and binder content decreases. A design and application procedure of solidified soil for scour repair and protection is also proposed for engineering reference.",scour repair and protection,solidified soil,pumpability,strength,flow properties,"Li, Ru-yu","Shu, Jian","Tang, Chao","Chen, Jin-jian","Wang, Hui-li",anti-scour performance,,,,,"Jiang, Hai-li",,"Wang, Xiao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper reviews case studies to identify incentives and disincentives for the public and local governments to be involved in public participation in planning. The identified incentives and disincentives are classified into individual, social, civil society, and governmental levels. The study finds that personal interests primarily incentivise the public, while local governments lack essential incentives. Governmental-level factors influence both parties, emphasising the need for political approaches to enhance public participation in planning practices in China.",public participation,willingness,planning,local government,,"Kytta, Marketta",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study is the first to examine empirically the impact of Israel's policy of absorption and spatial distribution on the formation of homogeneous ghettos of Ethiopians, and the contribution of the government's major housing assistance programs for Ethiopians to solving or exacerbating this problem. The study, structured into four main stages, embraces a mixedmethods research approach drawing on diverse theoretical and methodological frameworks. In the first stage, we use descriptive statistics to introduce the current characteristics of the Ethiopian population in Israel and compare them with those of other marginalized social groups. In the second stage, we analyze the government's various housingassistance programs for the Ethiopian population, focusing on three flagship programs. The third stage analyzes the spatial outcomes of the primary housing-assistance program, which remains active to date. Lastly, through in-depth interviews with policymakers and Ethiopian leaders, we delve into the underlying considerations that lay behind the policy decisions made. The research findings indicate that Ethiopians experience social and economic disadvantages, yet their spatial situation seems to be better than that of other disadvantaged groups, because a significant part of this population apparently enjoys the advantages of living in the center of the country. The findings further show that while the various government housing-assistance programs have elevated homeownership rates among Ethiopians, they have not prevent the formation and proliferation of spatial concentrations of poverty. Nor have they ever provided both the means and the knowledge needed to enable Ethiopians households to enhance their quality of life by moving out of these neighborhoods. To truly address the problem of homogeneous concentrations of poverty, a holistic but tailor-made housing policy is essential. This policy should not simply mirroring the national housing policy, which focuses almost exclusively on homeownership, but rather incorporate diverse policy measures for different populations. A good and just housing policy must take into account the existing spatial dynamic and the core-periphery relations and ensure an environment that provides quality employment and education opportunities alongside social networks that the residents can leverage to increase their social, economic, and cultural capital. Otherwise, the government housing-assistance programs will continue to be mere lip service and too little, too late.",Housing policy,Absorption policy,Concentrated poverty,Ethiopians,Israel,"Nachmany, Harel","Hananel, Ravit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Row_340,"Chu, Yixuan",Intermittent aeration mitigating carbon emission from landfills with gas-water joint regulation,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,OCT 2024,0,"Landfill is a significant source of atmospheric CH4 and CO2 emissions. In this study, four landfill reactor systems were constructed to investigate the effects of different ventilation methods, including continuous aeration (20 h d-1) and intermittent aeration (continuous aeration for 4 h d- 1 and 2 h of aeration every 12 h, twice a day), on properties of landfilled waste and emissions of CH4 and CO2, in comparison to a traditional landfill. Compared with continuous aeration, intermittent aeration could reduce the potential global warming effect of the CH4 and CO2 emissions, especially multiple intermittent aeration. The CH4 and CO2 emissions could be predicted by the multiple linear regression model based on the contents of carbon, sulfur and/or pH during landfill stabilization. Both intermittent and continuous aeration could enhance the methane oxidation activity of landfilled waste. The aerobic methane oxidation activity of landfilled waste reached the maximums of 50.77-73.78 mu g g- 1 h- 1 after aeration for 5 or 15 d, which was higher than the anaerobic methane oxidation activity (0.45-1.27 mu g g- 1 h-1). CO2 was the predominant form of organic carbon loss in the bioreactor landfills. Candidatus Methylomirabilis, Methylobacter, Methylomonas and Crenothrix were the main methane-oxidating microorganisms (MOM) in the landfills. Total, NO2- -N, pH and Fe3+ were the main environmental variables influencing the MOM community, among which NO2- -N and pH had the significant impact on the MOM community. Partial least squares path modelling indicated that aeration modes mainly influenced the emissions of CH4 and CO2 by affecting the degradation of landfilled waste, environmental variables and microbial activities. The results would be helpful for designing aeration systems to reduce the emissions of CH4 and CO2, and the cost during landfill stabilization.",Intermittent aeration,Methane oxidation,Carbon emission,Landfill,Microbial community structure,"Wang, Hua","Chen, Fengxian","He, Ruo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accurately quantifying and dynamically assessing the regional nitrogen and phosphorus pollution emission (NPPE) loads and influencing factors is crucial for local authorities to implement and formulate refined pollution reduction management strategies. In this study, we constructed a methodological framework for evaluating the spatiotemporal evolution mechanism and dynamic simulation of NPPE. We investigated the spatio-temporal evolution mechanism and influencing factors of NPPE in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) of China through the pollution load accounting model, spatial correlation analysis model, geographical detector model, back propagation neural network model, and trend analysis model. The results show that the NPPE inputs in the YREB exhibit a general trend of first rising and then falling, with uneven development among various cities in each province. Nonpoint sources are the largest source of land-based NPPE. Overall, positive spatial clustering of NPPE is observed in the cities of the YREB, and there is a certain enhancement in clustering. The GDP of the primary industry and cultivated area are important human activity factors affecting the spatial distribution of NPPE, with economic factors exerting the greatest influence on the NPPE. In the future, the change in NPPE in the YREB at the provincial level is slight, while the nitrogen pollution emissions at the municipal level will develop towards a polarization trend. Most cities in the middle and lower reaches of the YREB in 2035 will exhibit medium to high emissions. This study provides a scientific basis for the control of regional NPPE, and it is necessary to strengthen cooperation and coordination among cities in the future, jointly improve the nitrogen and phosphorus pollution tracing and control management system, and achieve regional sustainable development.",Nitrogen and phosphorus pollution emission,Influencing factors,Dynamic simulation,Yangtze river economic belt,,"He, Wanlin","Zhang, Zeyu","Liu, Xinhui","Yang, Yunsong","Xue, Hanyu",,,,,,"Xu, Tingting",,"Liu, Kunlin","Xian, Yujie","Liu, Suru","Zhong, Yuhao","Gao, Xiaoyong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed ARC-SV, a probabilistic and machine-learning-based method that enables accurate detection and reconstruction of cxSVs from standard datasets. By applying ARC-SV across 4,262 genomes representing all continental populations, we identified cxSVs as a significant source of natural human genetic variation. Rare cxSVs have a propensity to occur in neural genes and loci that underwent rapid human-specific evolution, including those regulating corticogenesis. By performing single-nucleus multiomics in postmortem brains, we discovered cxSVs associated with differential gene expression and chromatin accessibility across various brain regions and cell types. Additionally, cxSVs detected in brains of psychiatric cases are enriched for linkage with psychiatric GWAS risk alleles detected in the same brains. Furthermore, our analysis revealed significantly decreased brain-region- and cell-type-specific expression of cxSV genes, specifically for psychiatric cases, implicating cxSVs in the molecular etiology of major neuropsychiatric disorders.",,,,,,"Arthur, Joseph G.","Guo, Hanmin","Kim, Taeyoung","Huang, Yiling","Pattni, Reenal",,,,,,"Wang, Tao",,"Kundu, Soumya","Luo, Jay X.
