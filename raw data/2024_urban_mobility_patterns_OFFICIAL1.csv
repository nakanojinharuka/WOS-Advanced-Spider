Traditional zoning methods often overlook the temporal dynamics of urban space usage. This paper aims to investigate the daily rhythm of urban space usage and how built environmental features affect spatiotemporal mobility. The methodology integrates various urban data sources, including street and building vectors and points of interest (POI). In Ankara, T & uuml;rkiye, temporal usage types were identified using principle component analysis and k-means algorithms via Google Maps location-based service data. Multinomial logistic regression model was used to examine the impact of built-environment factors on daily mobility patterns. Results reveal distinct daily usage rhythms, categorizing busy areas into morning, noon, early evening, late evening, diurnal, and nocturnal zones. The study finds: (1) temporal usage is closely associated with spatial characteristics and resident income; (2) work-related activities drive morning mobility, while nighttime mobility relates to residence, income, and accessibility; and (3) population density alone does not guarantee continuous activities; diverse POIs alongside high density are crucial. The identified relationship between mobility measures and urban built environment indicators provides a comprehensive understanding of spatiotemporal variations, offering insights for critical policy evaluations and proposals for the future of urban areas.",Human mobility,Urban built environment,Spatiotemporal pattern,Multinomial logistic regression,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Traditionally, the origin-destination matrix representation of travel demand, where trip ends are agglomerated toward zone centroids that are decided a priori, has historically been used to identify trip making behavior. In this paper, different agglomeration methods are explored to extract the trip making behavior and their performances are analyzed. First, a variant of the zone-based agglomeration method is proposed, in which zones are optimally located rather than having their locations determined beforehand. Then a trip-based agglomeration method is proposed, where each trip is represented as an ordered pair of origin and destination in the form of a line segment and agglomeration of these line segments is performed. The proposed line-based agglomeration method serves a two-fold purpose, (a) the proposed trip-based agglomeration method helps in identifying the corridors carrying the majority of the flow in a single step, as opposed to trip-end based agglomeration methods where several post-processing steps may be required to identify the corridors, and (b) this method performs better than the existing trip-end based agglomeration methods in terms of the number of corridors that are required to cover the given trips. Efficient algorithms are also developed to solve the proposed trip-based agglomeration method, their performance on real-world trip datasets is tested and finally, the properties of the proposed algorithms are explored.",Urban mobility patterns,Agglomeration methods,Travel demand representation,Trip based agglomeration,"Gehlot, Hemant",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The large size and complexity of cities pose ongoing and essential challenges in obtaining precise data on building occupancy. The current examination of this topic simply looks at the data source and the model, lacking of their scope of application or the influencing factors behind occupancy pattern. Based on the perspective of urban to building-scale, multi data sources and mobility models in all domains, along with potential factors that influence occupancy patterns were systematically reviewed in this study. Currently, there are two main challenges in occupancy pattern generation in UBEM: 1) difficulty in obtaining data with both accuracy and breadth, and 2) difficulty in developing occupancy pattern models through tradeoffs between model complexity, accuracy, and interpretability. Therefore, combination of multisource data should be employed to obtain a more accurate representation of occupancy pattern within a city and future research should establish fit-for-purpose framework to find the best modeling method for UBEM. What's more, the interpretable model considering comprehensive influencing factors should be further established.

Urban development yields intertwining and interdependent functional areas for residence, commerce, and education, which leads to complex but regular population mobility patterns. Population mobility spaces can effectively represent the actual service scopes of urban functions. Therefore, in this study, we propose a function-associated population mobility network (FPMN) to dynamically delineate the service capacities of urban functions, and to quantify the driving effects of urban functions on population mobility under spatial interaction conditions. By integrating the cumulative opportunities of geographic nodes with the potential opportunities reflected by population mobility, k-step function accessibility with population mobility (k-step PFA) is defined in FPMN to characterize the accessibility relationships between geographic nodes and function nodes. Based on k-step PFA, considering the complementarity and intervention opportunities, the function-driven index (FDI) is proposed to quantify the driving effects of urban functions on population mobility. Our experimental results indicated that FPMN could effectively represent the actual service scopes and capabilities of urban functions. Compared with general location-based accessibility indicators, k-step PFA has a higher numerical distribution and less spatial disparity, and it aligns more closely with the actual service scopes of urban functions. In addition, compared with intervening opportunities models, FDI delineates the functional driving effects of population mobility with greater precision, as well as revealing the travel propensity traits of a population relative to various urban functions through propensity parameters.",Urban function,Population mobility network,Accessibility,Transferability,"Cai, Jing","Li, Bosen","Li, Yanhao",,,,Complementarity,Intervention opportunities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A vital element in achieving this objective is the availability of shared mobility providers offering sustainable alternative travel modes such as micromobility, carsharing, and ridehailing. Despite policy and industry efforts, shared mobility options have failed to change the travel patterns of current car users. We explore this urban mobility challenge through an empirical study of 807 urban travelers. Our results show that car drivers estimate travel costs conceptually rather than rationally and consider both trip purpose and length. In particular, car users perceive longer and recreational trips as cheaper per distance driven than shorter and work-related trips. A segmentation analysis reveals that habitual and technology-averse car drivers are particularly susceptible to this skewed cost perception, unlike more frequent transit users. Embedding these results in a case study of current shared mobility options shows that these options are ill-adjusted to the preferences of car travelers but more attractive to current transit users, potentially leading to cannibalization. Based on these findings, we outline several strategies for mobility providers and policymakers to attract car drivers to shared mobility options, thereby contributing to solving the urban mobility challenge.",Urban transport,Transport policy,Shared mobility,Travel mode,"Klein, Jan F.","Henkel, Sven",,,,,Travel cost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, integrating multiple semantic aspects with spatio-temporal information often leads to redundancy and computational challenges. To address this issue, we proposed MAT-SUM, a novel method for trajectory summarization while preserving semantic quality. This method identities urban regions based on associated semantic contexts and discretizes trajectories, yielding a high level of summarization without compromising semantic quality. This paper delves into the research questions we aim to address, focusing on the effectiveness of capturing human mobility and urban dynamics following the summarization of semantic trajectories using MATSUM. Our investigation aims to determine if comparable results can be achieved by analyzing summarized semantic trajectories compared to the original ones, such as classifying users exhibiting routine and non-routine behaviours.

Row_8,"Zhang, Shanqi","Hu, Zhuomin",Assessing the (in)equality of an x-minute city accounting for human mobility patterns,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,FEB 2025,0,"Developing x-minute cities has become a global effort since the proposal of 15-minute city by Carlos Moreno who has reworked several earlier planning theories and practices. Against this background, a burgeoning body of research literature has proposed quantitative methods for evaluating cities' progress towards the achievement of an x-minute city. However, current approaches predominately focus on the density and proximity aspects of x-minute cities, but underrepresent other critical aspects including the equality of x-minute cities. Human mobility patterns are also not accounted for in current approaches, leading to potential bias in evaluation results. This study bridges these research gaps by proposing an equality assessment framework that explicitly accounts for disparities in mobility patterns of different population groups. A mobility-aware accessibility metric is first proposed and then used as the basis for assessing the (in)equality of urban service provision across space and population groups. We use a full month of mobile phone signaling data in the city of Nanjing, China to obtain the activity patterns of different population groups. The case study suggests that not accounting for human mobility would lead to an overestimation of accessibility and accordingly a possibly too rosy view of achieving the x-minute city goal. In addition, the measurement of x-minute cities is sensitive to location, time, service types and population groups. These results have implications that developing an equitable x-minute city should move beyond the overly simplified proximity-based metric, but further accounts for different population groups' varying mobility patterns and their interactions with urban services.",X -minute city,Accessibility,Equality,Human mobility patterns,"Zhen, Feng","Kong, Yu","Tong, Ziyu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The built environment plays an important role in this sense. In this study, we aimed to investigate this association within Italian regions.Urban sprawl/sprinkling can be defined as urban patterns where large percentages of the population live in low density residential areas. It is quantified for each Italian region using the CI (Compactness Index). In the 20 Italian regions, the average obesity rate (defined as BMI >= 30) in 2021 was 9.75%. Our analysis showed a significant association of the CI with the obesity rate. People living in sprinkling areas seem to be more likely to gain weight than those living in more compact places. This could be related to the possibility of walking for daily activities. Combined with other research from public health, there is moderate support for the assertion that urban layout can have significant influences on health and health-related behaviors. Some possible developments of this project could be to define a demarcation threshold between pedestrian/cycle and motorized mobility in terms of distance and to suggest a clinical strategy to address obesity promoting active commuting, calibrated to the urban characteristics of the area.The research is fully in line with the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in particular with regard to the goals ""Good health and well-being, Gender quality and Sustainable cities and communities"".",Obesity,Overweight,Urban pattern,Urban sprinkling,"Romano, Bernardino","Giuliani, Antonio",,,,,SDGs 2030,,"INNOVATION IN URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING, VOL 2, INPUT 2023",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study addresses this issue by devising a methodology for the identification of optimal locations for active urban greenways within a metropolitan expanse, strategically aligned with the day-to-day pursuits of its inhabitants. Distinguished from prior greenway research, this investigation emphasizes individual mobility and adds a novel perspective to greenway planning. The method was tested in the city of Mashhad in Iran.

Most human mobility studies relying on aggregate flow data inevitably neglect the heterogeneity of disaggregate travel patterns with distinctive spatiotemporal characteristics, causing the uncertainty problem for identifying meaningful travel behaviors. Moreover, there is a lack of robust methodological approaches to extracting stable and genuine travel patterns under normal or disruptive situations. To address these issues, this study proposes a data-driven approach to spatiotemporal flow decomposition based on non-negative matrix factorization. With sparseness factored in the decomposition, stable disaggregate travel patterns can be extracted from origin-destination mobility flows. By combining temporal, spatial, and urban functional perspectives, heterogeneous travel behaviors can be analyzed and inferred. With a case study of the Zhengzhou '7.20' heavy rainfall in 2021, the most extreme rainfall ever recorded in China, this study validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach and managed to identify representative and interesting travel patterns and behaviors, facilitating a better understanding of human travel behaviors under external impacts.

Evidence from Fulton County, Georgia",TRAVEL BEHAVIOUR AND SOCIETY,JUL 2024,0,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on urban mobility. While studies highlighted socioeconomic disparities, few have paid attention to the moderating role of the built environment in shaping those changes. To fill the gap, this paper investigates associations between the morphological features of the built environment and changes in population mobility patterns during the pandemic. We used SafeGraph's travel data to Point of Interest (POI) sampled from 2019 to 2021 in Fulton County, Georgia to quantify mobility patterns at the census tract level. Through Principal Component Analysis and Factor Analysis, we extracted four key urban form features: density, connectivity, diversity, and centrality from a list of 12 raw built environment variables. Results of the spatial lag regression model indicate a significant relationship between the built environment and mobility changes, that a more diverse, denser, and more connected built environment can mitigate disparities of the mobility pattern changes which are often associated with inequitable socioeconomic backgrounds. And urban forms with higher density and diversity can encourage trips to green spaces, benefiting residents' mental and physical health during the pandemic. This research enhances the understanding of the relationship between the built environment and population mobility patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings are useful for urban planning and public health, in which particular attention should be paid to suburban low-income neighborhoods as the most vulnerable group facing both socioeconomic and built environment disparities in public health crises.

Facility proximity in spatial constraints is positively correlated with the volume of human movements, and is a significant factor in formation of the majority of lifestyle patterns. Differences in facility proportions between two neighborhoods contribute to crossneighborhood travels for life activities, but its effect could be mediated by the geographical distances between neighborhoods. Our findings demonstrate that the widely studied scaling laws in these areas are not independent but rather connected through a deeper underlying reality, which has important implications for urban planning and city management policies to enhance equal accessibility.",Human mobility,Population lifestyles,Facility distribution,Urban computing,"Mostafavi, Ali",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By examining pairs of brothers during the entire migration lifecycle - from childhood until age 34 - we estimate the effect of temporarily relocating to an urban area on occupational income over the mature working ages of 35-44 between the 1890s and the 1940s in Sweden. The results show that rural-urban migrants who returned to the countryside were not failures who did not improve their social position, but instead experienced substantial gains compared with their non-migrant brothers. These gains were similar to those of migrants who had permanently settled in urban areas. This pattern is mainly attributed to their capacities to leave farming and enter white-collar positions to a greater extent than non-migrants. The extent of temporary rural-urban migration, combined with the high levels of intergenerational mobility of return migrants in Sweden during the period examined, suggests that rural-urban migration to towns resulted in positive feedback effects for the countryside.",cities,intergenerational mobility,migration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These devices provide valuable information about the intensity of vehicles traversing a specific street in a particular direction. This kind of data affords a comprehensive understanding of the city's mobility and traffic conditions. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the spatiotemporal patterns of vehicular mobility in the city of Palma. Palma, the focus of this study, is a Mediterranean city located on the island of Mallorca (Spain). Palma has an approximate population of 400,000 residents. The city's economy is heavily reliant on tourism, with around five million tourists visiting annually. Spatiotemporal traffic dynamics were analyzed at six monitoring stations for the period 2003-2022 located in high, medium, and low-income residential areas. The results show a significant decrease in the total number of vehicles in all neighbourhoods. Daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly mobility patterns were examined, generally showing a substantial drop in the number of vehicles. Apparent causes behind this include the development of restrictive private vehicle mobility policies, the increase in bike lanes, the reduction in the number of lanes on main roads, and the delineation of no-traffic zones. These results allow for optimism for the future of vehicle traffic in Palma, in favour of a more sustainable city. Despite the decrease experienced in vehicle counts throughout the period analyzed for the selected sensors located in residential areas, the obtained results should be interpreted very cautiously, as this situation cannot be generalized to the rest of Palma's areas.

As centers of activity and zones of economic and demographic resources, urban centers stand out as privileged areas for the implementation of local strategies aiming at reducing air pollutant emissions, whether through spatial planning, the evolution of services or the transformation of practices. In this work, we propose a diagnosis of the links between population, urban forms, mobility and air pollutant emissions, using the OLYMPUS activity-based emission model. The model is run over two distinct French regions, Pays de la Loire and Ile-de-France, characterized by contrasting urban characteristics in terms of structure, density and accessibility. The results highlight the good transposability of the OLYMPUS model over different territories. Then, the interconnections between the specificities of urban systems on one side and the travel demand, modal share, mobility patterns and total road emissions on the other side, are explored.

Previous research has primarily identified key freight areas (KFAs) in small-scale regions using traditional census and travel survey data. However, differing from KFAs, other areas with distinct freight patterns remain largely unexamined, and there is a lack of comprehensive indicators to evaluate the travel behaviors of large-scale freight vehicles. This study introduces a data-driven geospatial framework to characterize and understand the patterns exhibited by different freight areas through freight dynamics data collected in cities. To analyze key aspects of freight mobility within spatial units, a set of areal indicators is developed using GPS trajectories of shared freight vehicles in Hong Kong. Descriptive statistics illustrate the inherent differences across various areas and their spatial distributions. A hierarchical clustering approach groups all areas based on proposed indicators, providing a quantitative evaluation of collective spatial patterns. The analysis also explores the non-linear relationships between different categories of freight activities and the local built environments and socioeconomic conditions. The results suggest a strong spatial heterogeneity in the areal mobility profile of Hong Kong. Loading and unloading behaviors are frequently observed in districts such as Eastern Kowloon, Kwai Chung, and the Airport, highlighting prevalent freight trip origins and destinations. In contrast, areas with high transit times are mostly found in suburban regions, particularly on the periphery.

The study focuses on the PM2.5 levels in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, and considers COVID-19 as an unintentional intervention. The PM2.5 level of the city was obtained from a network of low-cost calibrated sensors, while UM is characterized by open-access Google reports. The period under consideration excludes the weeks immediately before and after the first lockdown. PM2.5 data were deweathered using the machine learning technique of random forest (RF) to exclude the variation of meteorological factors, seasonality, and weekday-weekend effect, and then the impact of the pandemic was parametrised. The traffic pattern is discussed, and air mass clustering and pollution polar plots are used to analyse the distribution of long- and shortrange sources, respectively. The percentage change from the baseline (PCfB) of the average of UM dimensions is then assessed against that of deweathered PM2.5 level to investigate the impact of UM on the PM2.5 level. Our analysis shows a strong correlation between urban mobility and roadside PM2.5 levels and a weaker relationship with urban PM2.5 levels.

Quality of pedestrian mobility is the key to attain liveability and inclusivity in a city. However, the gender lens towards understanding the mobility patterns of women and young girls is largely missing from the urban planning process. Due to this exclusion, the majority of Indian cities are not gender friendly. To address this issue, this study tried to propose a 3 step framework for mitigating gender safety issues while a woman walks in a city. The 3 steps involve identifying the key elements of pedestrian mobility; quantitatively evaluating the qualitative parameters; and visual analysis for validating the major issues. This paper presents a pilot study conducted in the city of Kanpur, India. The research was initiated by conducting focus group discussions among 23 participants to map their typical movement patterns and identify 6 key elements of pedestrian mobility. Subsequently, the study conducted a net promoter score (NPS) survey among 423 participants to gauge the safety perception levels on each of the 6 key elements against 5 deduced qualitative parameters via literature review. NPS is a user satisfaction measurement tool which is based on the user perception used by companies and brands. Since urban safety is largely to do with perception, a NPS metric is employed. Further, the paper employed heatmap analysis and derived 3 critical areas based on gender safety perception to deep dive i.e. accessibility and lighting at sidewalks; lack of lighting at underpass; and absence of street furniture at bus stops. Visual analysis was undertaken to understand and validate the respective safety perceptions.

It is urgent to assess population health risks related with urban air pollution, which usually relies on census method and meteorological measurement data. However, health impacts may be underestimated, because of challenges to represent the dynamic population mobility and perform unified analysis of different pollution hazards. The contribution of this work is to combine census data with Location Based Service to identify the spatiotemporal mobility pattern of urban population, and then population-weighted exposure (PWE) and health impacts of various air pollution (PM2.5, O3, and NO2) are synergistically evaluated. Taking Nanjing as the study area, it was found that the pollution peak areas correlated with population mobility in the study region, shifting from urban suburbs to the center during the daytime, with the maximum concentration exceeding 165 mu g/m3. O3 caused a relatively high PWE level and had a greater health impact than PM2.5 and NO2, adding the mortality by up to 5 % especially on weekdays. The annual health impact of O3 was approximately twice that of PM2.5 and NO2.

Based on a two-stage non-parametric technique, the efficiency of 49 German municipalities alongside transport systems' inefficiency determinants is assessed. In line with previous studies, we find highly populated municipalities to operate more efficiently than smaller ones. Second, efficiency is driven by modal split and individual mobility patterns, with a positive correlation between territorial mobility and trips made by bike or public transport.

Newly emergent dockless bike-sharing platforms that record detailed trip information provide us a unique opportunity. Attributing to its better usage flexibility and accessibility, dockless bike-sharing is booming over the past few years worldwide and reviving the cycling fashion in cities. In this work, by exploiting massive platform-collected trip records in four diversified Chinese cities, we reveal that individual mobility patterns, including radius of gyration and average travel distance, are similar among the users with different income, indicating that human beings all follow similar physical rules. However, collective mobility patterns, in terms of average range and diversity of visitation, and commuting direction, exhibit different behaviors and spatial patterns across income categories. Hotspot locations that attract a high volume of cycling activities are quite different over groups, and locations with either a lower or higher income level have a relatively low user ratio. Cyclists from lower income groups are inclined to visit less flourishing locations across all four cities, and have a higher fraction to commute toward the city center in larger cities and away from the city center in smaller cities. Middle income groups of cyclists generally have a higher visitation diversity except in Shanghai.

However, these trajectories, typically collected from location-based services, often suffer from sparsity and irregularity in time. To support the development of mobile applications, there is a need to recover or estimate missing locations of unobserved time slots in these trajectories at a fine-grained spatial-temporal resolution. Existing methods for trajectory recovery rely on either individual user trajectories or collective mobility patterns from all users. The potential to combine individual and collective patterns for precise trajectory recovery remains unexplored. Additionally, current methods are sensitive to the heterogeneous temporal distributions of the observable trajectory segments. In this paper, we propose CLMove (where CL stands for contrastive learning), a novel model designed to capture multilevel mobility patterns and enhance robustness in trajectory recovery. CLMove features a two-stage location encoder that captures collective and individual mobility patterns. The graph neural network based networks in CLMove explore location transition patterns within a single trajectory and across various user trajectories. We also design a trajectory-level contrastive learning task to improve the robustness of the model.

Specifically, shared mobility services experienced a shift in demand due to increased concerns about COVID-19 transmission. As we move beyond the pandemic, gaining insights into the evolving travel demand landscape becomes crucial for adapting operations to the new normal of travel behavior. To that end, this study seeks to examine travelers' intentions to adopt shared e-scooters and bikes in a scenario where COVID-19 risk is no longer a prominent factor. To achieve this, survey data were collected in Fall 2022 from three cities in the Midwest U.S. with different sizes, population densities, and maturity of shared mobility services. The survey solicited respondents' opinions about their willingness to adopt shared mobility services in a future scenario. Covariance-based multigroup structural equation modeling (MGSEM) was conducted to compare travel attitudes and perceptions among users from the three cities. Findings highlight the positive influence of attitudes, perceived behavioral control, and social norms on intentions to use micro-mobility. Additionally, the study reveals an unexpected positive influence of COVID-19 risk perception on intentions in one of the three cities, presenting an opportunity for service providers to capitalize on the perceived safety of shared micro-mobility in the future.

However, studies on athletes and human archaeological samples suggest the importance of including fibular structural properties to reconstruct mobility patterns in past populations. This study analyzes human fibular variation in relation to mobility patterns, environmental conditions, subsistence economies, and shoe use to further explore the role of this bone in reconstructing mobility patterns in past populations. The sample consists of 173 individuals from Italian archaeological and modern skeletal collections spanning the Mid-Late Upper Paleolithic to the twentieth century and includes hunter-gatherers, agriculturalists, herders, and post-industrialists. Virtual three-dimensional models of left fibulae were acquired by computer tomography and surface scanning. Fibular proximal and distal epiphyseal morphologies were investigated through 3D semilandmark-based geometric morphometric methods and compared among populations and mobility categories. Our analysis reveals a trend separating groups based on their subsistence strategy and chronology. Some fibular traits (e.g., horizontal proximal tibiofibular joint and tilted distal talofibular articular surface, robust interosseous membrane, broad malleolar fossa, projecting m. biceps femoris insertion) indicate greater mobility of fibular joints and load sharing during ankle and knee excursion in foraging groups, which are presumably highly active, frequently traversing uneven terrain with absent/minimalist foot coverings. Stiffer fibular joints (e.g., obliquely oriented tibiofibular and vertical talofibular articular surfaces) are observed in sedentary populations, which may suggest a restricted ankle excursion and limited lower limb loading and use, consistent with their sedentary lifestyle in plain urban settlements with hard-shoe coverings. Other fibular traits (e.g., shorter subcutaneous triangular surface, projecting and anteriorly-facing malleolus, concave peroneal groove and proximal peroneal insertion) might indicate for mobile groups a more everted foot posture with increased moment arm in eversion, more efficient for barefoot/minimal footwear running in a forefoot-strike gait and concurring in the stabilization of the first metatarsophalangeal ray.

These surfaces can trigger the development of multiple bacterial taxa and favor their spread during rain events through the circulation of runoff waters. These runoff waters are commonly directed toward sewer networks, stormwater infiltration systems or detention tanks prior a release into natural water ways. With water scarcity becoming a major worldwide issue, these runoffs are representing an alternative supply for some usage like street cleaning and plant watering. Microbiological hazards associated with these urban runoffs, and surveillance guidelines must be defined to favor these uses. Runoff microbiological quality from a recently implemented city center rainwater harvesting zone was evaluated through classical fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) assays, quantitative PCR and DNA meta-barcoding analyses. The incidence of socio-urbanistic patterns on the organization of these urban microbiomes were investigated. FIB and DNA from Human-specific Bacteroidales and pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus were detected from most runoffs and showed broad distribution patterns. 16S rRNA DNA meta-barcoding profilings further identified core recurrent taxa of health concerns like Acinetobacter, Mycobacterium, Aeromonas and Pseudomonas, and divided these communities according to two main groups of sociourbanistic patterns. One of these was highly impacted by heavy traffic, and showed recurrent correlation networks involving bacterial hydrocarbon degraders harboring significant virulence properties. The tpm-based meta-barcoding approach identified some of these taxa at the species level for more than 30 genera. Among these, recurrent pathogens were recorded such as P. aeruginosa, P. paraeruginosa, and Aeromonas caviae. P. aeruginosa and A. caviae tpm reads were found evenly distributed over the study site but those of P. paraeruginosa were higher among sub-catchments impacted by heavy traffic. Health risks associated with these runoff P. paraeruginosa emerging pathogens were high and associated with strong cytotoxicity on A549 lung cells. Recurrent detections of pathogens in runoff waters highlight the need of a microbiological surveillance prior allowing their use. Good microbiological quality can be obtained for certain typologies of sub-catchments with good hygienic practices but not all.

Nevertheless, the collection of OD flow data is extremely difficult due to the hindrance of privacy issues and collection costs. Significant efforts have been made to generate OD flow based on urban regional features, e.g., demographics, land use, and so on, since spatial heterogeneity of urban function is the primary cause that drives people to move from one place to another. On the other hand, people travel through various routes between OD, which will have effects on urban traffic, e.g., road travel speed and time. These effects of OD flows reveal the fine-grained spatiotemporal patterns of population mobility.

There are many factors that affect intercity population mobility, such as socioeconomic attributes, geographical distance, and industrial structure. The complexity of the coupling among these factors makes it difficult to simulate intercity population mobility. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named the quantum harmonic oscillator model for simulation of intercity population mobility (QHO-IPM). QHO-IPM describes the intercity population mobility as being affected by coupled driving factors that work as a multioscillator-coupled quantum harmonic oscillator system, which is further transformed by the oscillation process of an oscillator, namely, the breaking point of intercity population mobility. The intercity population mobility among seven cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and its surrounding region is taken as an example for verifying the QHO-IPM.

The method has been applied to the spatial extension of the daily life of members of the Autonomous University of Barcelona. The results make it possible to identify the impact of the place of residence and the mode of transport in daily mobility patterns on a metropolitan scale.",mobility,urbanism,metropolitan areas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It contributes to a better understanding concerning socio-economic and residential factors affecting modality styles with a specific focus on sustainable travel modes. We examined residents living in the inner city (Kalamaja neighbourhood) and an inner suburb (Priisle neighbourhood). We conducted a modality styles analysis based on smartphone tracking data from 108 people over 14 months. Cluster analysis distinguished five urban modality styles, of which four were dominated by one travel mode (i.e., car, public transport, bike, or walk) while one displayed a multimodal style. Modality styles are fairly evenly distributed in Tallinn, with the walk dominant style representing 32% of all individuals, the car dominant style 27%, the multimodal 23%, the public transport dominant 13%, and the bike dominant 5%. The walk dominant style has the largest share for women, Estonian-speakers, inner city residents, and households that do not own a private car. The car dominant style has the largest share among men, Russian-speakers, inner suburban residents, and households that own a private car. The share of travel modes is more variable over time for active modality styles and more regular for motorized styles. Our discussion includes consideration of the implications of our results from a policy perspective. Broadly, two major categories of policies are recommended: 1) strengthen the relative competitiveness of sustainable travel for suburban residents, 2) provision of more vibrant, mixed-use character in suburban areas while simultaneously preserving housing affordability.",Urban mobility,Modality styles,Travel modes,Sustainable mobility,"Saidla, Karl","Poom, Age","Tammaru, Tiit",,,,Inequalities,Smartphone data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This difficulty is intensified by an insufficient understanding of how different urban types perform for distinct sustainability dimensions and indicators. In this study, this knowledge gap is investigated in a highly representative Euro-Mediterranean city (Valencia) through: (1) a landscape-based approach leading to the characterization of urban-landscape types via the combination of three geospatial layers, and (2) the assessment of those urban-landscape types with a comprehensive sustainability index deducted from several international, national, and local indices. Results reveal firstly that urban-landscape types can help us identify areas with common morpho-functional patterns that differ from conventional districts or quarters. Secondly, a comparative analysis of these urban-landscape types reveal that they partially display different sustainability profiles and, consequently, might accommodate distinct policies and plans. Thirdly, the incorporation of spatial, metabolic, and mobility dimensions in the proposed index permits addressing transversal issues affecting environmental, social, and economic sustainability. By linking the form and functioning of the city with its sustainability profiles through a landscape-approach, this study is expected to assist planners and policymakers in the design of sustainability transitions adjusted to the specificities of different urban configurations.",Urban landscape,Sustainability indicators,Urban typologies,Landscape characterization,,,,,,,Urban sustainability assessment,Landscape units,,Urban sustainability transitions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Contributing factors such as climate change and increased human mobility have expanded the vulnerability to dengue fever worldwide, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In this paper, we extend a two-patch dengue transmission model by incorporating the aquatic stage of mosquitoes and integrating the movement of host individuals between patches via a residence-time matrix. Through this approach, we derive the basic reproduction number and directly link it to climate change and human mobility. Our findings reveal bidirectional impacts of human mobility on dengue transmission: an increase in mobility from climatically unsuitable to suitable patches heightens the basic reproduction number, while the reverse pattern diminishes it. Moreover, an asymmetric mobility rate proves potentially more conducive to dengue spread than a symmetric pattern. When coupled with climate changes, asymmetric human mobility further exacerbates dengue fever transmission. These insights offer novel perspectives on the role of human mobility in dengue transmission dynamics and inform intervention strategies, particularly in urban settings where dengue epidemics are driven by human mobility.",Dengue outbreak,Mathematical modelling,Human mobility,Climatic change,"Pedersen, Michael","Zhang, Lai",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aiming to close this gap, the Center for Multiscale Applied Sensing team deployed its mobile observatory in the street canyons around the curved Wells Fargo Plaza skyscraper in downtown Houston, TX. Three deployments allowed airflow observations under different inflow wind and thermodynamic stability conditions. Doppler lidar measurements reveal that when inflow hits the curved wall of the skyscraper, perpendicular canyons experience similar vortex configurations creating two windward and two leeward circulations. Windsond measurements support that buoyancy within the deep street canyons can generate thermal updrafts as strong as 2 m s-1 which is sufficient to overturn the mechanical downwash under gentle wind conditions. Canyons experiencing venting during the daytime were observed to be more thermodynamically stable at night while thermodynamically stable canyons during the day were observed to be more thermodynamically unstable at night owing to the accumulation of heat near street-level. Fourier decomposition of the vertical velocity measurements shows that in all cases flow exhibited high Reynolds numbers and was composed of turbulent eddies of predominantly 6 and 15 min periods.

While most literature focused on finding patterns for home and work activities, we further investigated non- home and non-work-related activities to detect patterns associated with them. Temporal attributes of activities are extracted from trip information recorded by Tehran subway's automatic fare collection system. In addition, land-use data is also incorporated to further enhance spatial attributes for non-home/work activities. Various activity attributes such as start time, duration, and frequency in addition to land-use data are used to infer the activity purposes and patterns.

We investigated passengers' activity pattern and behavior changes before and during COVID-19 pandemic by comparing the discovered patterns. For recreational patterns it is revealed that not only has the number of recreational patterns dropped, but also the duration of recreational activities decreased. Morning patterns of educational activities have also been eliminated and number of commercial activities was decreased during COVID-19.

By analyzing sediments, the study provides interesting results on urban pollution and its environmental impact. The research consists of two main phases, each addressing different aspects of pollution. In the first phase, different pollution indicators are used to analyze heavy metals and organic pollutants in urban drainage sediments. The results are compared with sediment quality guidelines, regulatory thresholds, and local and international references. Most of the metallic contaminants exceed the toxicity levels established by the continental crust and sediment quality guidelines, suggesting an anthropogenic origin. In addition, contamination indices show significant accumulation. In this context, the results highlight the importance of accumulation and transport processes in urban sediments. Hydrological parameters significantly influence heavy metal distribution mechanisms. Remarkable variations between copper (Cu) and lead (Pb) suggest a combined or singular source during transport. Conversely, chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), and iron (Fe) are mainly derived from natural lithological sources. Cadmium (Cd) is associated with anthropogenic sources related to the agricultural use of phosphate fertilizers, whereas zinc (Zn) is mainly derived from physical corrosion processes. In the second phase, a combined descriptive and multivariate statistical analysis examines the mobility and distribution of heavy metals and their relationships with organic matter (OM) over time. Pronounced temporal variations in Cd, Zn, and Cu concentrations are attributed to human activities. Strong correlations exist between OM and cobalt (Co), Cu and Pb, confirming the ability of OM to adsorb these metals under specific geochemical conditions associated with waste disposal. Conversely, Zn, Cd, Cr, and Ni show weak or negative correlations with OM, suggesting diverse sources, including potential agricultural, industrial, and natural origins. The dendrogram confirms the existence of previously identified contaminant groups, suggesting common sources and potential co-occurrence patterns. This analysis highlights the role of the drainage network as a physico-chemical reactor in the mobilization of contaminants. It underlines the importance of sediment interactions in urban pollution processes. Finally, recommendations are proposed to ensure effective pollution control and remediation.Practitioner Points Useful information on pollution and its environmental impact is provided by the analysis of sediments in the urban basin of Saida (NW-Algeria).

Drainage system serves as a pathway for dispersing contaminants.This study analyzes urban sediment contamination, establishes toxicity limits, and identifies anthropogenic sources of contamination. It investigates temporal variations in metal concentrations influenced by human activities and assesses ecological risks. It examines the role of organic matter in metal adsorption and investigates how drainage networks affect the dispersion and mobility of contaminants.

The location big data obtained from human activities, which is cohesive with urban functions, provides valuable insights into human mobility patterns. However, as urban functions become highly mixed, existing feature representation structures struggle to explicitly depict the latent human activity features, limiting their applicability for detecting mixed urban functions in a supervised manner. To close the gap, this study analogizes the latent human activity features to the shape, texture, and color semantics of images, with a contrastive learning framework being introduced to extract image -based crowd mobility features for detecting mixed urban functions. Firstly, by translating human activity features into image semantics, a novel feature representation structure termed the Trajectory Temporal Image (TTI) is proposed to explicitly represent human activity features. Secondly, the Vision Transformer (ViT) model is employed to extract image -based semantics in a self -supervised manner. Lastly, based on urban dynamics, a mathematical model is developed to represent mixed urban functions, and the decomposition of mixed urban functions is achieved using the theory of fuzzy sets.

In our research, we applied full spatiotemporal coverage of mobile phone data to identify the complete travel mobility of metro ridership in the perspective of ground and underground transit. First, the mobility of the boarding and alighting stations was extracted and the order of the transfer station was then extracted. Second, relying on the ridership flow identification method, the aboveground origin and destination of the ridership outside the metro system were extracted, and their transferred traffic mode was identified.

To address the problem, this research proposes a spatio-temporal rebalancing optimization framework for the urban car-sharing system (CSS) based on geospatial big data and machine learning. In the spatial dimension, we construct the urban car-sharing network data set using geospatial big data. The graph deep learning is used to mine the car-sharing space demand patterns for location planning. This data-driven graph neural network approach breaks through the limitations of complex mathematical models in the previous location planning and can cope with large-scale CSS in real time when data is available. In the temporal dimension, we construct a combined optimization model of dynamic relocation and pricing based on the optimized car-sharing station layout. A multi-threaded reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to solve the optimal relocation and pricing scheme. Dynamic relocation and pricing strategies are obtained by reinforcement learning algorithms based on accumulated historical operational data and real-time market demand, aiming at maximizing profits and optimizing resource utilization. The simulation results show that the combined optimization model of dynamic relocation and pricing provides a more effective solution than the non-combined model. The proposed optimization framework provides systematic decision support for solving urban CSS supply-demand imbalance and yields extensive theoretical and practical implications, especially in urban traffic management.",Sustainable mobility,Urban car-sharing systems,Spatio-temporal rebalancing,Dynamic relocation and pricing,"Li, Rui",,,,,,Machine learning,Geospatial big data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analysed the distribution of robbery and theft in Barcelona, Spain, as a testing application.

The outcomes of regression models shed new light on the relationship between mobility and crime. When the walkhood scale is established, human mobility patterns have a stronger effect on the outcome variables than when census tracts are used. Results point to walkability constraints and social distances imposed by the massive presence of sporadic users in public spaces as strong predictors of crime occurrence, arguably due to their negative effects on neighbourhood social ties formation.

This study provides a more comprehensive picture of the role that shared micro-mobility services play on transport equity by investigating the influential factors of shared micro-mobility use and its impact on perceived transport poverty between different income groups. We developed regression models using data from an online survey conducted in 2022 in three European cities (Malmo, Manchester, and Utrecht).

Accordingly, this research aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of mobility dynamics, distinguishing between different mobility modes, and introducing a novel predictive maintenance system tailored for bikes. By utilising a combination of trip information and maintenance data from Barcelona's bike-sharing system, Bicing, this study conducts an extensive analysis of mobility patterns and their relationship to failures of bike components. To accurately predict maintenance needs for essential bike parts, this research delves into various mobility metrics and applies statistical and machine learning survival models, including deep learning models. Due to their complexity, and with the objective of bolstering confidence in the system's predictions, interpretability techniques explain the main predictors of maintenance needs. The analysis reveals marked differences in the usage patterns of mechanical bikes and electric bikes, with a growing user preference for the latter despite their extra costs. These differences in mobility were found to have a considerable impact on the maintenance needs within the bike-sharing system.

We aimed to analyse a global natural experiment exploring city mobility patterns during the pandemic and how they related to the implementation of COVID-19-related policies. Methods We obtained data from Apple's Mobility Trends Reports on city mobility indexes for 296 cities from Jan 13, 2020 to Feb 4, 2022. Mobility indexes represented the frequency of Apple Maps queries for driving, walking, and public transit journeys relative to a baseline value of 100 for the pre-pandemic period (defined as Jan 13, 2020). City mobility index trajectories were plotted with stratification by country income level, transportation-related city type, population density, and COVID-19 pandemic severity (SARS-CoV-2 infection rate). We also synthesised global pandemic policies and recovery actions that promoted or restricted city mobility and active transportation (walking, cycling and micromobility, and public transit) using the Shifting Streets dataset. Additionally, a natural experiment on a global scale evaluated the effects of new active transportation policies on walking and public transit use in cities around the world. We used multivariable regression with a difference-in-difference (DID) analysis to explore whether the implementation of walking or public transit promotion policies affected mobility indexes, comparing cities with and without implementation of these policies in the pre-intervention period (Jan 27 to April 12, 2020) and post intervention period (April 13 to June 28, 2020). Findings Based on city mobility index trajectories, we observed an overall decline in mobility indexes for walking, driving, and public transit at the beginning of the pandemic, but these values began to increase in April, 2020. Cities with lower population densities generally had higher driving and walking indexes than cities with higher population density, while cities with higher population densities had higher public transit indexes. Cities with higher pandemic severity generally had higher driving and walking indexes than cities with lower pandemic severity, while cities with lower pandemic severity had higher public transit indexes than other cities. We identified 587 policies in the dataset that had known implementation dates and were relevant to active transportation, which included 305 policies on walking, 321 on cycling and micromobility, and 143 on public transit, across 230 cities within 33 countries (19 high income, 11 middle-income, and three low-income countries). In the global natural experiment (including 39 cities), implementation of policy interventions promoting walking was significantly associated with a higher absolute value of the walking index (DID coefficient 20675 [95% CI 8778-32572]), whereas no such effect was seen for public transit-promoting policies (0600 [-13293 to 14494]). Interpretation Our results suggest that the policies implemented to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic were effective in changing city mobility patterns, especially increasing active transportation. Given the known benefits of active transportation, such policies could be maintained, expanded, and evaluated post pandemic.The discrepancy in the interventions between countries of different incomes highlights that changes to the infrastructure to prioritise safe walking, cycling, and easy access to public transit use could help with the future-proofing of cities in low-income and middle-income countries.

Exploring urban green spaces as cooling solutions for older adults in a warming city,URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING,AUG 2024,0,"As cities grapple with the escalating challenges of urban heat and its impacts on vulnerable populations, particularly older adults, green spaces are increasingly promoted as effective urban cooling solutions. However, despite the extensive literature on people's access to and preferences for urban green spaces, little is known about the perception and use of these spaces as nature-based climate shelters on hot days, especially by older adults. This study focuses on Barcelona, a Mediterranean city facing rising temperatures, to explore older adults' patterns of use and preferences for urban green spaces on hot days. The research aims to: 1) analyze heat coping behaviors, emphasizing visits to urban green spaces; 2) identify crucial characteristics of green spaces for older adults; and 3) assess variations in behaviors and preferences based on socio-demographic factors. The study leverages survey data from 291 older adult residents, combining face-to-face and online formats. Results indicate that 54 % of older adults use urban green spaces for cooling on hot days, with preferences for morning or evening visits. Factors influencing non-visitation include perceived lack of thermal comfort, noisiness or crowdedness, and proximity issues. Alternative heat coping strategies include staying at home, traveling to cooler areas outside the city, visiting blue spaces, or air-conditioned indoor facilities. Preferred green space characteristics include abundant shade, leafy vegetation, accessibility factors (e.g., walkability), urban furniture (e.g., benches), and water features. Socio-demographic differences reveal higher green space use among younger age groups and residents in certain districts. Mobility limitations and lower education levels influence preferences, with mobility-challenged individuals prioritizing accessibility aspects. Lower-educated respondents are more likely to report barriers to accessing green spaces. These findings highlight the need for tailored urban planning strategies, considering sociodemographic variations, to mitigate heat-related health risks for older adults. By prioritizing green space accessibility, enhancing its quality, promoting its cooling benefits, addressing cooling inequalities and integrating climate considerations in urban green planning, cities facing increasingly pressing heat challenges can create climate-resilient and inclusive green environments that prioritize the well-being of their aging populations.",Thermal comfort,Climate shelters,Climate change adaptation,Nature-based solutions,"Cole, Helen V.

In contrast to past studies that have quantified the impact of gender using survey and qualitative data, we examine a novel data-driven workflow utilizing a combination of previously developed origin, destination, and transfer inference (ODX) based on individual transit fare card transactions, name-based gender inference, and geospatial analysis as a framework to identify mobility of care trip making. We apply this framework to data from the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Analyzing data from millions of journeys conducted in the first quarter of 2019, the results of this study show that our proposed workflow can identify mobility of care travel behavior, both in terms of (1) detecting times and places of interest where the share of women travelers in an equally-sampled subset (on basis of inferred gender) of transit users is 10 %-15 % higher than that of men, and (2) finding women significantly more likely to exhibit a consistent accompaniment patterns with riders who are children, elderly, or people with disabilities.

Traditional models and machine learning solutions often fall short in capturing the complex dynamics of urban mobility, overlooking factors like spatial correlation and human mobility patterns. Recent deep learning advancements have shown promise by integrating spatial correlation through incorporating geographical adjacency. However, this approach may not fully capture spatial correlation, particularly the semantic adjacency effect of zones connected via public transportation lines, such as metro networks-a novel dimension overlooked in prior research. The metro station serves as a major transit hub, attracting passengers from various origins and destinations and correlating the flow between the connected zones and other zones within the metro network. Devising an optimized model to encapsulate these spatial correlations is another crucial area of research where scientists are actively seeking the most effective solutions. We propose a novel sequential hybrid approach leveraging graph-based learning, focusing on the underexplored impact of metro networks on commuting flow prediction. Our model integrates two types of adjacency-geographic and semantic-using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to embed geographic correlations among proximate zones and Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to incorporate semantic adjacency defined by metro line connectivity. Furthermore, our approach innovatively incorporates features directly from online maps, eliminating reliance on third-party resources and enhancing scalability and efficiency. We validate our model using real- world datasets from Montreal, Canada, comprising travel surveys and GPS trajectory types, totaling nearly 900,000 trip records.

Secondly, some preferences show clear spatial distribution patterns when regressed with residential location choice. Thirdly, the gap between preferences and actual residential practices varies across morphological attributes. As a main result, the clustering analysis shows that 43 % of the population aspire more to tranquility than to functional proximity; and those aspiring for proximities (32 %) are the youngest and wealthiest.

Perceiving periodic patterns is the key to understanding residents' daily needs and living range, which provides evidence for more reasonable resource allocation and urban planning. For example, if a group of people visits medical centres continuously and stably at short intervals, the allocation of medical resources should lean toward this group of people. However, previous methods are too rigid for detecting periodic patterns. They cannot distinguish the stability and continuity of periodic patterns, resulting in the inability to differentiate the significance level of certain patterns to some people and the omission of some vital but imperfect patterns.

Additionally, people living in these areas tend to travel farther to access urban parks compared to areas with no public housing. More deprived neighbourhoods were revealed to have lower accessibility to urban greens in Auckland, highlighting the urgency to address the emerging divisions in accessibility and opportunities for these neighbourhoods.

Utilizing the YOLO v3 model, our research focuses on developing a prototype for counting vehicles at an urban roundabout connecting three main roads, providing essential data for planning EV charging infrastructures. This work involves adapting and optimizing the YOLO v3 model to accurately identify and count vehicles passing through the roundabout. The aim is to measure traffic volume and identify circulation trends, which are crucial for understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of vehicles. The collected data not only estimate the number of EVs likely to traverse this area but also predict the needs for charging infrastructure in and around this specific roundabout. Our prototype demonstrated high accuracy in vehicle counting, allowing detailed analysis of traffic patterns at different times of the day. This analysis reveals significant variations in traffic flows, providing valuable insights into the most suitable times and locations for installing EV charging stations. While this study focuses on a single roundabout, it establishes a precedent for using advanced deep learning techniques in assessing EV charging infrastructure needs in broader urban contexts.

Reykjavik residents have been found to have high emissions in both local and leisure travel. The study aims to explore the connections between urban mobility and leisure travel behaviour using a novel method - activity spaces. The relationship between activity spaces and travel emissions is examined for the first time, based on data of about 700 respondents from a softGIS survey. Connections between activity spaces, local and domestic travel were found. High levels of urban mobility were connected to higher engagement in domestic leisure travel, indicating the presence of a highly mobile lifestyle among Reykjavik urbanites. The reasons for the travel could stem from compensation behaviour, or social network dispersion. In addition, the study points at a lack of functioning 15-minute neighbourhoods and public transit in the capital area. Some differences between income groups were noticed, particularly in urban mobility, pointing at the need to examine the social floor of mobility even within generally affluent societies, so that disadvantaged groups do not get left behind in the sustainable mobility transition. As it has been suggested that people travel for their well-being and to escape the tumult of urban life, the relationship between urban mobility, especially environmental exposure during daily travel, and well-being should be studied.

This paper uses game theory to investigate charging pricing methods for the AMoD fleets. Firstly, an AMoD fleet scheduling model with appropriate scale and mathematical complexity is established to describe the spatio-temporal action patterns of the AMoD fleet. Subsequently, using Stackelberg game and Nash bargaining, two game frameworks, i. e., non-cooperative and cooperative, are designed for the charging station operator (CSO) and the AMoD fleet. Then, the interaction trends between the two entities and the mechanism of charging price formation are discussed, along with an analysis of the game implications for breaking the non-cooperative dilemma and moving towards cooperation. Finally, numerical experiments based on real-world city-scale data are provided to validate the designed game frameworks. The results show that the spatio-temporal distribution of charging prices can be captured and utilized by the AMoD fleet. The CSO can then use this action pattern to determine charging prices to optimize the profit.

First, this study proposes a framework of ""Urban-Canal-Rural"" from a multidimensional perspective. In this research, we re-examined the urban-rural differences within the region by using the canal as the central regional conduit connecting urban and rural areas. Then, an association network based on five dimensions was constructed, and the network's connectivity was detected. In light of this, the integration characteristics and factor flow mechanism of ""Urban-Canal-Rural"" were revealed. Based on the study, we identified the potential interactive advantages of urban-rural integration within the canal basin, which provides the strategy for the development of ""Urban-Canal-Rural"" integration. The study found that within the same region, ""Urban-Canal-Rural"" shows completely different correlation strengths in five dimensions, revealing that the urban-rural differences in the process of urbanization are closely related to the inadequate utilization of resources. It also confirmed the importance of multidimensional network construction in balancing the allocation of resources between urban and rural areas in the process of urban-rural integration. Finally, the relations of factor mobility and resource allocation to sustainable urban and rural development were discussed.

Existing methods for mining such patterns, however, tend not to consider the reduced likeliness of trips with increasing travel cost. Consequently, it is difficult to differentiate the patterns emerging from people's specific travel interests from those simply due to travel convenience. To solve this problem, this article presents Geo-SigSPM for mining geographically interesting and statistically significant sequential patterns from trajectories. Here, 'geographically interesting' patterns are those more frequent than their expected frequencies which consider both the travel cost and non-redundancy of any place in the patterns. To achieve this, Geo-SigSPM formulates the expected frequencies of the patterns based on doubly-constrained human mobility models and the frequencies of their subsequences. A set of statistical tests is also developed to evaluate the identified interesting patterns. Experiments with synthetic and Foursquare check-in datasets demonstrate the efficacy of Geo-SigSPM in discovering geographically interesting patterns, controlling the spurious pattern rate, and discovering patterns that better reflect people's specific travel interests than the conventional frequency-based pattern mining approach.

This study explores the public perception and acceptance of a new concept: shared car services in multi-unit residential buildings, offering residents tailored solutions while retaining the convenience of private car ownership. The study provides insights about the motivations and barriers to adoption among urban dwellers in Israel, using the methodology of focus groups to collect data and the Product Service System approach for analysis. This concept remains unexplored in current literature. The findings from three focus groups comprising Israeli dwellers in multi-unit buildings in densely populated areas suggest that the acceptance and adoption of such services are influenced by the availability of on- and offstreet parking, cost of private car ownership, service quality, and trust among users and toward the service provider. To remove adoption barriers and promote low-carbon sustainable mobility, policy implications include increasing the cost of car ownership and parking fees while reducing parking availability. Implementing more restrictive parking policies should be coupled with policy incentives that widen the availability of shared vehicle services. The insights gained could inform the integration of shared vehicles in multi-unit buildings and promote the development of supportive regulatory frameworks.

Understanding the dynamic patterns of human mobility under extreme heat will contribute to accurately assessing the risk of extreme heat exposure. This study leverages an emerging geospatial data source, anonymous cell phone location data, to investigate how people in different communities adapt travel behaviors responding to extreme heat events. Taking the Greater Houston Metropolitan Area as an example, we develop two indices, the Mobility Disruption Index (MDI) and the Activity Time Shift Index (ATSI), to quantify diurnal mobility changes and activity time shift patterns at the city and intra-urban scales. The results reveal that human mobility decreases significantly in the daytime of extreme heat events in Houston while the proportion of activity after 8 p.m. is increased, accompanied with a delay in travel time in the evening. Moreover, these mobility-decreasing and activity-delaying effects exhibited substantial spatial heterogeneity across census block groups. Causality analysis using the Geographical Convergent Cross Mapping (GCCM) model combined with correlation analyses indicates that people in areas with a high proportion of minorities and poverty are less able to adopt heat adaptation strategies to avoid the risk of heat exposure. These findings highlight the fact that besides the physical aspect of environmental justice on heat exposure, the inequity lies in the population's capacity and knowledge to adapt to extreme heat. This research is the first of the kind that quantifies multi-level mobility for extreme heat responses, and sheds light on a new facade to plan and implement heat mitigations and adaptation strategies beyond the traditional approaches.",Heatwave,Human mobility,Adaptation strategies,Urban resilience,"Hu, Leiqiu","Qiang, Yi","Zhou, Bing","Yang, Mingzheng","Lin, Binbin",,Heat resilience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This pattern, amplified by the growing use of automobiles, adversely affects city sustainability, causing delays, pollution, and increased carbon emissions. Addressing this, we introduce a mobile edge computing framework utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing. This framework incorporates real-time vehicle-to-infrastructure communication and intelligent speed control algorithms into a mobile app, targeting speed optimization at signalized intersections to alleviate the negative impacts of stop-and-go traffic at urban intersections. The framework comprises three components: a cyberinfrastructure-based messaging system for real-time traffic and signal data from IoT-connected signal controllers and traffic sensors; a speed optimization algorithm generating speed advisories using phone-based sensor data (like GPS and driving directions), signal phase and timing information, and roadside vehicle detector data; and an ad-hoc mobile computing environment turning smartphones into edge devices for hosting the algorithm. This enables intelligent speed advisory along signalized corridors. The paper presents the detailed design and implementation of the proposed framework, highlighting its practicality, utility, and energy-saving potential.

This is the topic which the authors attempt to emphasize. One potential challenge for traffic prediction tasks is that short-term-incident-induced traffic pattern changes cannot be timely detected and the deployed model cannot adapt to the new traffic pattern. As for encountering long-term incidents, such as during COVID-19, traffic patterns are gradually changing, and the prediction model also needs to be periodically updated to avoid the so-called out-of-distribution problem. Therefore, the online training and predicting mechanisms can facilitate model updates, deployment of traffic prediction applications, and the planning of trips, especially when special events happen, such as the long-lasting COVID-19 pandemic. However, most existing traffic performance metrics narrowly focus on one aspect of the impacts but not comprehensive changes to the network. Further, during the pandemic, urban traffic patterns and travelers' trip planning were dramatically affected and, thus, network-wide online traffic prediction became an urgent but more complicated task. To overcome such challenges, this study proposes a traffic performance score (TPS) incorporating multiple parameters for measuring both urban and freeway network-wide traffic performance. The TPS is compared with other metrics to show its superiority. To solve the challenging network-wide online traffic prediction task, this study also proposes an online training and updating strategy to predict network-wide traffic performance. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model with the online learning strategy outperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy and learning efficiency.

The research aims to identify the mobility and sociodemographic user profile of bike and e-scooter sharing and understand the key determinants of people's intention to use these modes in the future. To consider the effect of local context on shared micromobility usage, the study exploited survey data (N = 1607) that were collected in three European urban areas (Brussels, Munich, and Vienna). The obtained dataset provided information on respondents' socioeconomic characteristics, mobility capabilities and preferences, including travel frequency by bike and escooter sharing services. The survey also collected information on respondents' likelihood of travelling by shared micromobility in the future. The profile of current users was revealed by conducting a Latent Class Analysis (LCA). The measurement and membership LCA models were estimated based on the mobility and sociodemographic data, respectively. The three-class LCA model uncovered that shared micromobility users are mostly members of the so-called ""Mobility chameleons"" population group whereas few users belong to the ""Car lovers"" and the ""Public transport fans"" classes.

These trends might point to an urbanisation transition from the primate city stage to the secondary city stage. Research is needed to determine at which stage of urbanisation China currently resides, and who are migrating across the different levels of cities in this stage. In order to answer these questions, the current study combines the theory of differential urbanisation and migrant selectivity, and analyses city-level migration patterns and demographic characteristics of migrants across the urban hierarchy. The findings indicate that China is currently in the intermediate primate city stage, where the upward migration across the urban hierarchy is driven by younger adults with higher education and income, and a lower likelihood of marriage or parenthood. Building upon global evidence, this research further extends the theory of differential urbanisation by incorporating migrant selectivity into the interpretation of urbanisation stages.

Since the early 2000s, large cities have had positive migration balances. Almost unnoticed, however, in the early 2010s the patterns of internal migration started to shift towards rural locations. It was only the COVID-19 pandemic that drew attention to these changing tendencies and the apparent new appreciation of rural living. In this paper, we will first shed light on the changes in internal migration between 2000 and 2021. We divide this period into three phases and show that the overall pattern of population centralisation transformed into a process of decentralisation. This trend further intensified during the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondly, based on a German-wide population survey, we present findings on the reasons why households moved from urban to rural areas between mid-2015 and mid-2020, with personal, employment-related and housing- related reasons being the most relevant. To better understand urban-rural migration (or 'counter- urbanisation'), we pay particular attention to how respondents experienced cities and urban housing markets and which residential characteristics they ascribed to the rural destination. We show that urban-rural migration is a multifaceted decision in which the structural impediments of urban housing markets lacking affordable housing play a relevant part. In conclusion, we argue that research on urban-rural migration needs to more systematically pursue the idea of a complex and contingent decision that is driven by both structural factors and personal preferences.

Even though casual users account for a large share of ridership and revenue at bike-share systems in New York City (NYC), very little is known about the characteristics and preferences of casual users and how they compare to members.

Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) is a powerful tool for vehicular traffic simulations; however, traditional methods of generating traffic demand are usually based on random trips or the use of real-world datasets, which can be difficult to obtain. More advanced approaches create algorithms to generate trips based on multimodal activities.

Therefore, we proposed a new scheme to generate large-scale traffic demands, where a real-world dataset is fed into an ML model to predict traffic flows. We then calibrate the traffic flows to match the predicted ones, resulting in realistic traffic flows for urban scenarios. The approach is highly computationally efficient and can be applied to any city scenario. Furthermore, the training data set and the ML model can be updated for more precise predictions. In the end, we create the whole map of Berlin and generate around 1.2 million vehicles as a 24-hour trial, and compared the predicted model with the real-world measured dataset.

The proposed ST-GraphRL consists of three compositions: (i) a weighted directed spatial-temporal graph to explicitly construct mobility interactions over space and time dimensions; (ii) a two-stage joint encoder (i.e., decoupling and fusion), to learn entangled spatialtemporal dependencies by independently decomposing and jointly aggregating features in space and time; (iii) a decoder guides ST-GraphRL to learn mobility regularities and randomness by simulating the spatial-temporal joint distributions of trajectories. Tested on three real-world human mobility datasets, the proposed STGraphRL outperformed all the baseline models in predicting movements' spatial-temporal distributions and preserving trajectory similarity with high spatial-temporal correlations.

Research indicates that PMD user behavior, especially in urban areas, is crucial in these crashes, underscoring the need for an extensive investigation into key factors, particularly those causing fatal/ severe outcomes. Remarkably, there exists a noticeable gap in the research concerning the analysis of determinants behind fatal/severe PMD crashes, specifically in PMD rider-at-fault collisions.

Additionally, we explore the varying attractiveness of origin-destination (OD) station pairs to commuters with a rank-flow approach and we develop a realistic determinant to measure the penalty risks with the time reserved for the last -mile trip. Our findings verify theoretical bottleneck models, aid in the understanding of distribution of commuting demand and land uses, and support policy making, such as flexible working-hour policies for peak demand managements.",Human mobility patterns,Arrival penalty risks,Time scheduling preference,Morning peak period,"Liu, Zhiyuan",,,,,,Commuting behavior,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used smart card data from Kunming, China, to identify selected individuals' residential locations and travel patterns, and evaluate their accessed activity space. We performed a disaggregated analysis of the individual activity space, and then aggregated the activity counts on each grid. This study found that the residential locations of older metro travelers are significantly different from those of other metro travelers. In addition, socio-spatial differentiation was found to exist due to different daily requirements. The results were confirmed in three LASSO models with built environment variables.

This research utilized historical time-series SVI, cyclist data from London, to discern the causal effects of specific urban features on cyclist numbers. We used propensity score matching to adjust for potential confounding biases and applied the causal forest to estimate the heterogeneity in causal effects. Key findings include: vegetation significantly boosts cycling, slope negatively impacts cycling, and bike lanes positively influence cycling. Moreover, vegetation's impact on cycling is greater in less populated areas, while bike lanes have a stronger effect in densely populated regions.

Due to specific differences in infrastructure, vehicles, and users' behavior, places where different modes of traffic intersect are recognized as critical points of the traffic system, making them crucial areas for the implementation of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs). The SUMPs aim to create urban mobility that is both environmentally friendly and safe for all users. The continuous development and widespread adoption of innovative ITS technologies have paved the way for a system that can provide drivers with real-time information about both immediate and potential dangers at these critical points. This paper presents a comprehensive review of prior research conducted in the field, investigating the impact of information systems on drivers' behavior, various detection and communication solutions that can be effectively integrated into such a system, and a brief overview of the models and solutions that have been developed to warn drivers in a similar context. A review of the literature found that warning systems have a significant impact on driver behavior, which contributes to increased traffic safety. Furthermore, there are numerous solutions applicable to a multimodal environment. Yet, they mostly refer either to autonomous vehicles or require an additional unit of infrastructure for communication, which is not realistically applicable to the current state of traffic in most countries of the world.

Such information is invaluable for monitoring large urban areas and supporting the implementation of decision-making services. When analyzed in real time, NSD can enable the early detection of critical urban events, including fires, large accidents, stampedes, terrorist attacks, and sports and leisure gatherings, especially if these events significantly impact mobile phone network activity in the affected areas. This paper presents empirical evidence that advanced NSD can detect anomalies in mobile traffic service consumption, attributable to critical urban events, with fine spatial (a spatial resolution of a few decameters) and temporal (minutes) resolutions. We introduce two methodologies for real-time anomaly detection from multivariate time series extracted from large-scale NSD, utilizing a range of algorithms adapted from the state-of-the-art in unsupervised machine learning techniques for anomaly detection. Our research includes a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of these algorithms on a large-scale dataset of NSD service consumption for the Paris region. The evaluation uses an original dataset of documented critical or unusual urban events. This dataset has been built as a ground truth basis for assessing the algorithms' performance. The obtained results demonstrate that our framework can detect unusual events almost instantaneously and locate the affected areas with high precision, largely outperforming random classifiers. This efficiency and effectiveness underline the potential of NSD-based anomaly detection in significantly enhancing emergency response strategies and urban planning.

By analyzing the behavior of bikes and electric scooters, the results can help urban planners design infrastructure that better accommodates these vehicles, such as optimized roundabout geometries and dedicated lanes for micromobility. In addition, the results can serve as a basis for traffic regulations and signage improvements to make the interaction between micromobility users and motor vehicles safer while promoting sustainable solutions for urban mobility.Abstract The rapid spread of micromobility vehicles such as bicycles and electric scooters poses new challenges to urban transportation systems, particularly in terms of road safety and infrastructure integration. This study investigates the driving behavior of micromobility users at a mini-roundabout, focusing on their speed profiles and their position within the lane during the entry, circulation, and exit phases. A structured recruitment process was used to select 20 participants with previous micromobility experience. Participants performed crossing maneuvers at a mini-roundabout in Gravina di Catania, Italy, which were monitored using drone footage and analyzed with tracking software to extract trajectories and speed data. The results show significant differences between e-scooter and bicycle users, with bicycles showing less speed variability, especially during the crossing and exit phases, while e-scooters showed greater variability, especially during the entry and exit phases. The results highlight the influence of vehicle stability and user posture on riding behavior and emphasize the need for infrastructure adaptations to increase safety. Mini-roundabouts designed for moderate speed are identified as a promising solution to improve the coexistence of micromobility and motor vehicles. This research identifies key differences in speed profiles and behavioral patterns between e-scooter and bicycle users, offering actionable insights and recommendations for safer and more efficient urban infrastructure.

At the methodological level, a combined approach was employed, involving, on the one hand, the collection of open access public data from institutional repositories and information provided by the government and, on the other hand, network analysis and graphical mapping using GIS tools. The results obtained at the micro level (individualised study of each urban bus line) reveal a significant decrease in the number of passengers during the pandemic, showing the effect of mobility restrictions and the fear of contagion. However, a gradual recovery in post-pandemic demand has been observed, highlighting a large variability in recovery patterns between different bus lines. Such a situation could be attributable to several factors, such as the socio-demographic characteristics of the areas served, the frequency of the service, connectivity with other modes of transport and users' perception of the quality of the service. At the macro level (comparison between urban and interurban transport), lines with higher demand prior to the pandemic have shown greater resilience and faster recovery. However, urban transport has experienced a more uniform and accelerated recuperation than interurban transport, with significant percentage differences in the years analysed. This disparity could be explained by the greater dependence of inhabitants on urban transport for their daily trips, due to its greater frequency and geographical coverage. Interurban transport, on the other hand, shows a more fluctuating demand and a lower dependence of users. Finally, the lack of previous research focused on the impact of the pandemic in sparsely populated rural areas restricts the ability to establish a solid frame of reference and generalise the results of this study. The authors consider that more detailed future research, including a comparative analysis of different alternative transport modes in inter-urban settings and considering a broader set of socio-demographic variables of passengers, is needed to better understand mobility dynamics in these areas and their evolution in the context of the pandemic.",public bus transportation,rural areas,demographic challenge and depopulation,patterns of displacement mobility,"Jimenez-Espada, Montana","Vivas, Jonathan Galeano",,,,,COVID-19,GIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fusion algorithm demonstrates a higher noise point detection rate (15.85%) compared with the DBSCAN algorithm alone (7.31%), thus significantly reducing noise impact in kernel density analysis. Spatial correlation analysis between hotspot areas and paths uncovers distinct travel behaviors: During morning and afternoon peak hours on weekdays, travel times (19-40 min) exceed those on weekends (16-35 min). Morning peak hours see higher taxi utilization in residential and transportation hubs, with schools and commercial and government areas as primary destinations. Conversely, afternoon peaks show a trend towards dining and entertainment zones from the abovementioned places.

Using data for large European cities in the period 2018-2021, we examine whether LEZs may explain differences in the recovery patterns of traffic in European cities after the shock of Covid. Controlling for several city attributes, we examine whether LEZ cities are less congested before and after the pandemic in comparison to non-LEZ cities. LEZs may have been more effective in reducing congestion after the pandemic because the fleet renewal process has slowed down or, alternatively, LEZs may be a proxy of unobservable factors related with attitudes of governments and citizens toward a sustainable mobility. Our results validate the traffic-mitigating role of the LEZ after the Covid-19 pandemic, although such result only holds for the pioneering LEZ cities. Hence, the traffic-mitigating role of the LEZ after the Covid-19 pandemic seems to be related to unobservable attributes that influenced the early decision to implement a LEZ. In this regard, we also find that LEZs may have induced a change in local attributes related to sustainable mobility given that we do not find differences between LEZs decided at the local or regional level.",cities,congestion,low emission zones,sustainability,,,,,,,traffic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Suburban areas are often more affordable in terms of housing, but these neighbourhoods tend to be car-oriented. This leads to higher commuter costs, immobility, transport and time poverty, pollution, higher accident rates and a lack of social interactions. To offer sustainable mobility options to citizens, we must comprehensively understand, together with their individual characteristics, their specific mobility practices and the built environment where they live.

Our findings suggest that transport policies have encouraged sustainable mobility practices, particularly in the centre of Barcelona. Despite the positive results, considerable disparities exist between the inner and outer city, with a notable decline in sustainable mobility practices in the latter, due to the uneven distribution of basic services and uneven provision of public transport, together with lower density areas.

The relationship between pilot compensation and task workload was investigated based on eye metrics. Data mining results revealed that pilots' eye movement patterns and workload perception change when performing Mission Task Elements (MTEs) that involve aircraft deficiencies. Additionally, pupil size, pupil diameter, iris diameter, interpupillary distance, iris-to-pupil ratio, and gaze entropy are found to be correlated with both handling qualities and task workload. Furthermore, a handling qualities and pilot workload recognition model is developed based on Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), which is subsequently trained and evaluated with experimental data, achieving an accuracy of 97%.

However, restorative environments research currently lacks theory and empirical evidence on gendered restorative processes. Literature on epidemiology has studied gender differences in greenspaces and mental health outcomes but results are unclear so far. In parallel, social psychology of gender and feminist urbanism suggest that gender-related socio-cultural norms, attitudes, and behaviours; roles and relations; stereotypes, expressions; identity and sexual orientation, as well as certain sex-related factors, can have profound influences on women's (and gender minorities') experiences in public space. Drawing from these disciplines, we address this key knowledge gap of restorative environments research by reviewing the role of gender and sex in psychological restoration and wider psychological experiences in urban greenspaces. The findings reveal that gender-related and certain sex-related factors can affect aspects of person-greenspaces interactions, including when greenspaces are accessed and where; why they are visited and with whom; and how greenspaces are experienced. Several potential barriers to women's and gender minorities' experiences in urban greenspaces are identified. These relate to visit characteristics (transport accessibility and mobility patterns, frequency, time, social context and purpose of visits), experiences of contextual features (perceived and objective safety, the quality and maintenance of urban greenspace, infrastructure features), and several top-down person and group-based experiences (personal meanings, majority dynamics and group belonging, intersecting sociodemographic and personal characteristics). Overall, the person-environment fit in urban greenspaces might be lower for women and gender minorities than for men. This might translate into lower perceptions of compatibility and being away and, simultaneously, higher attentional demands. Overall, this might reduce the restorative and psychological benefits of urban greenspaces for women and gender minorities. Future research is encouraged to assess empirically the effects of the identified gender- and sex-related factors in restorative experiences of urban greenspaces, as well as to explore restorative experiences among specific socio-demographic groups in which gender intersects with other personal and social features.",,,,,"Fasoli, Fabio","Faccenda, Giulio","Subiza-Perez, Mikel","Ratcliffe, Eleanor","Beyazit, Eda",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Taking Beijing as an example, this study extracts the time series of pick-up and drop-off points the taxi GPS track dataset and employs the affinity propagation (AP) method to conduct the spatial and temporal cluster analysis on these taxi pick-up and drop-off points. Then, based on the urban POI dataset, this study classifies these stations into four functional types by adopting the K-means method. Finally, the partial least squares method has been used to explore the relationship between the taxi passenger flow and the land use types under different time intervals. The result indicates that: first, is a regional aggregation effect for the taxi passenger source in the rail transit station area, and the cluster areas are mainly located in Chaoyang and Haidian districts, well as along the circular metro line. Besides, there is a significant rush hour in the morning and evening for this passenger flow. Second, the commercial, residential, comprehensive transit stations are mainly located in the central urban districts of Beijing with balanced spatial distribution, while the industrial transit stations are dispersed to the outer suburbs of the city, which conform to Alonso's spatial distribution of land. Third, there is a significant positive correlation between taxi passenger sources rail transit station area and land use types containing transportation service, public facility and daily life service. This study analyses the population mobility and land cluster form around the urban rail transit from the micro-perspective, which verifies and supplements Alonso's transportation location theory.

The papers in this special issue analyse key issues of the digital turn in urban studies, focusing on the pre-eminence of platforms in the tourism-led economic and social restructuring of our cities.This 'big platformisation of cities' has generated changes in urban lifestyles, consumption patterns and forms of capital accumulation, impacting on trade relations, forms of mobility and labor market shifts in the city. Therefore, theoretical concepts such as 'platform economy', 'platform capitalism' or 'platform urbanism' are being used to explain current shifts in the dynamics of urban capital accumulation, leaving behind innocuous ones such as 'collaborative economy' or 'smart city'. Such conceptual twists reflect the analytical relevance of platform-mediated labor and the mechanisms of surplus value extraction from platforms to fully unveil the spatial and social transformations in the city. Specifically, the papers of this special issue follow three fundamental themes: the role of digital platforms in the itinerant lifes of urban dwellers, the dynamics of tourism rentierism in the platform age, and the precariousness of labour in digital capitalism.

These lessons are of many types, including co-learning with other agencies, conducting research and pilots in advance of developing and enacting EMM policies or service models, and responding to equity demands. Our findings also suggest that policies for EMM devices tend to over-rely on public safety concerns to motivate their enactment.

As one of the prevalent mobility-on-demand services, online designated driving allows car-owners booking professional drivers via mobile apps to deliver private cars (frequently with the car-owners inside) to a designated location for a fee. Online designated driving can play a crucial role in promoting road safety by providing a responsible alternative for those who cannot drive themselves due to drinking or fatigue, but there is still a lack of empirical study on its basic travel patterns. Using massive trip records of online designated driving, this study investigates the collective and individual spatio-temporal travel patterns, and reveals the spatio-temporal impact mechanism of various land-use types on online designated driving demand. Take Beijing as a case study, the results show that unlike ridehailing trips that primarily occur during the daytime, 93.07 % of online designated driving trips occurs between 18:00 and 7:00 the next day, with the longest peak observed on Friday nights. Meanwhile, the average distance of online designated driving trips is approximately twice as long as that of ride-hailing trips (16.58 km vs. 8.48 km). The collective travel patterns of online designated driving exhibit a shrinking trend in the form of ""surface-line-point"" over time. Regarding individual patterns, we rigorously demonstrate that 81.55 % of high-frequency users exhibit a ""fixed-destination"" phenomenon, indicating a clear centripetal tendency. Furthermore, online designated driving is primarily associated with limited land-use types, revealing that it may serve specific target audiences, like travelers returning from entertainment and catering activities after consuming alcohol, or those in need of transportation for business and automotive services.

However, the potential negative implications of high rates of car ownership and use for wellbeing, sustainability, and social equity have sparked the interest of many scholars. We contribute to these lines of inquiry by examining whether and if so, how car dependence relates to people's satisfaction with life. Our data come from a national survey with a representative sample (n = 2,155) of U.S. adults living in urban and suburban areas. Using descriptive statistics and multivariate regression models, we find that there is a threshold effect of car dependence on life satisfaction. Our results show that beyond a certain point, increases in car dependence yield a decrease in people's satisfaction with life. For instance, we find that, in a typical week, relying on a car for more than 50 percent of the time for out-of-home activities is associated with a decrease in life satisfaction. These findings suggest that planners and decision-makers should promote multimodality and land use patterns that may help to reduce car dependence and its potential negative effect on subjective wellbeing (SWB).",Travel behavior,Car use,Mobility,Subjective wellbeing,"Jamme, Hue-Tam","Corcoran, Nicole","Hitzeman, Jordyn",,,,Life satisfaction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, traditional crowd behavior prediction models tend to learn regular trends and patterns of crowd traffic, and usually fail to predict the abnormal traffic fluctuations triggered by urban events. In this work, we propose a context-aware framework to accurately predict event-triggered abnormal crowd traffic by explicitly modeling event contexts and their impact. We start by training a state-of-the-art spatiotemporal multi-graph model (MG) leveraging a multi-graph convolutional network (MGCN) to model city-wide venues and their connections, as well as gated recurrent unit (GRU) to capture the crowd traffic patterns within venues. In order to model the time-occasional impact of sudden influential event context (e.g., weather conditions), we propose a multi-task fusion diagram to co-train the MG model by learning a temporal impact embedding with an attention mechanism and recurrent neural network to obtain the MG-MT model. In order to model the hyper-space impact of irregularly distributed event context (e.g., epicenters and trajectories), we propose a multi-view fusion diagram to fine-tune the above-mentioned model by learning a spatial impact graph with a stimulus-response mechanism to obtain the spatiotemporal crowd traffic model (STORM). Experiments using real-world urban data collected from Xiamen, China show that our approach improves over the state-of-the-art baseline by more than 6% in predicting crowd traffic and by more than 40% in the abnormal crowd traffic part.",Crowd-behavior prediction,spatiotemporal data,urban computing,,"Shou, Tieqi","Wang, Zeyu","Chen, Liyue","Wang, Leye","Wang, Cheng","Chen, Longbiao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to enhance the accuracy of estimating ground-level fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) concentrations by fusing chemical transport model outputs with empirical observations, estimating exposures using human mobility data, and evaluating the impact of environmental justice. Employing a novel data fusion technique, the study combines the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) outputs and surface PM 2.5 measurements, providing a more accurate estimation of PM 2.5 distribution.

Results reveal that despite reduced mobility during high PM 2.5 levels from wildfire smoke, exposure for both residents and individuals on the move remains high. Regions already burdened with high environmental pollution levels face amplified PM 2.5 effects from wildfire smoke. Furthermore, we observed mixed correlations between PM 2.5 concentrations and various demographic and socioeconomic factors, indicating complex exposure patterns across communities. Urban areas, in particular, experience persistent high exposure, while significant correlations in rural areas with EJScreen factors highlight the unique vulnerabilities of these populations to smoke exposure.

Using panel data collected in Australia from 2013 to 2021, we examine the association between life satisfaction scores and selective geographic mobility, and the possible influence that living at specific locations may have on individual life satisfaction trajectory, while controlling for individual personality traits and socio-demographic factors. Our results indicate that urban residents reporting lower life satisfaction scores before the move have a higher probability of moving to a rural area. Similarly, lower life satisfaction scores are associated with a higher probability of moving to a region with a different climate. We also find evidence that moving from the city to the country is associated with an uplift of the life satisfaction trajectory for the individual. A similar conclusion is reached for people who moved to a warmer climate, but not for a move to a cooler climate.

To address this issue, this study developed a novel framework for forecasting the start of crowding and its change over time (termed the lifespan of crowded events (LCE)). Based on the concept that event purposes influence the crowding patterns, our framework models these patterns according to the event purposes. Inspired by the acoustic synthesis that can successfully model the change in the sound volume for each instrument, we extended a canonical long short-term memory (LSTM) model with the concept of ADSR envelope, wherein the sound (crowd) volume changes can be represented within simple state transitions. The proposed versatile acoustic tri-state envelope for segmental LSTM, namely VATES, is evaluated on two datasets: synthetic and real-world mobility datasets. The results demonstrate that VATES can forecast crowding patterns with a 24.3% performance improvement, and precisely predict the start and end times of crowding, thereby improving by 6.6% and 26.1% respectively. We believe that our method enhances urban safety and mobility in crowded events, contributing to smarter city management.",Crowd forecasting,urban computing,ADSR envelope,acoustic synthesis,"Shimosaka, Masamichi",,,,,,time series forecasting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results show that jobshousing relationship differ between city types and have seasonal cycles and yearly trends reflecting the rhythm and development of human activity. The temporal variations in jobs-housing relationship are affected by regional mobility, and larger intercity travel volume leads to lower balance level. The spatial variations in jobshousing relationship are influenced by the form of regional structure, as measured using the Zipf scaling exponent.

The paper relies on registeredbased data aggregated to geographical coordinates to identify places of transience and uses k-nearest neighbour for measuring the intensity of unstable moves in spatial terms. Furthermore, the mapping of housing instability across four distinct time frames spanning from 1990 to 2020 illustrates the temporal unfolding of these patterns. The findings indicate a progression of housing instability spreading from specific spatial points to a more widespread dispersion of transience.

The findings reveal that the use of public transportation and taxis mirrors the city's polycentric layout, with each transportation mode fulfilling distinct roles in linking disparate urban areas. The nonlinear effect of the built environment on OD flows exhibits mode-specific variations, particularly in relation to thresholds. Additionally, network topology characteristics are identified as significant factors in explaining OD flows for all modes.

One of the challenges underlying predictions of location choice is the large choice set. While traditionally many methods had been devised to limit the choice set size either on a rather ad hoc basis or based on space-time prism by removing the locations out of reach of the subjects, the current study takes a substantially different approach and proposes a data-driven method to customize the generation of the choice set. The proposition is that observing the mobility patterns of citizens for multiple weeks would enable us to limit the choice set, depending on how far the subjects travel (beyond or within the distance they travel for their most frequent activities) to conduct their various activities. More precisely, using longitudinal trajectory data, we first classify people into two subgroups: returners and explorers, based on the size of the area (around their k most visited locations: k-radius of gyration) they move during the observation period. The destination choice set for four types of activities is then customized for returners (and explorers) and is used in a sequence of decisions represented by decision trees for the prediction of their destinations. The models for the whole sample and each subgroup separately are compared. The results suggest that the accuracy of destination prediction improves substantially for all four selected activity types, especially for the returners whose choice sets are formed based on their radius of gyration.",Destination choice,GPS data,Human mobility pattern,Radius of gyration,"Feng, Tao",,,,,,Decision tree (DT),Longitudinal trajectory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Social practice theories allow us to understand the constitution of human activity and its embeddedness in society. In transformation research, the relevance of social practice theories has been recognized. However, there is still a lack of understanding regarding the conditions under which practices change substantially and what kinds of tools and governance approaches are suitable to foster change in social practices. We therefore propose a novel way to address the transformation of consumption patterns of private households by a) connecting social practice theories to life cycle assessment for a quantitative environmental evaluation of transformation processes and b) using narrative approaches to understand the links between several social practices and conditions for change. An illustrative study of a bottom-up neighbourhood initiative shows how specific meanings and values (expressed, for example, through meanings of ""enough"") affect several social practices from different consumption categories (nutrition, daily mobility, travelling). Environmental assessments further show that changing social practices across consumption categories can substantially decrease environmental pressures from private household consumption, especially in the field of nutrition. The understanding of how various social practices are connected in a nexus through narratives embodying deeper meanings point to novel ways of fostering change and the relevance of social practices related to urban or neighbourhood initiatives as an entry point to a more sustainable way of living.",Social practices,Life cycle assessment,Narratives,Sustainable consumption,"Greiff, Kathrin",,,,,,Circular economy,Circular society,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although developed countries are better equipped to handle the consequences of flood events due to investments in disaster risk reduction measures, less developed countries are struggling to cope with this challenge. This can be attributed to the complexities of managing floods while ensuring environmental sustainability, which are yet to be fully understood. As such, developing strategies to manage floods, adapt, and build resilience requires understanding the complex relationships between socioeconomic, environmental, and infrastructural factors to promote policy development in sustainable flood risk management. System archetypes provide a framework for understanding complex system behaviour and assessment of intended and unintended consequences of policy actions. Using the coastal city of Limbe as a case study, this paper identified and analysed four key system archetypes that define flood risk management in Limbe;- 'fixes that fail', 'shifting the burden', 'limits to growth/success' and 'growth and under-investment'. Findings from the study underscore that policy availability does not directly translate to policy implementation and that Limbe's operational policies prioritise quick fixes for flood symptoms, often leading to unintended consequences, emphasizing the need for adaptive, flexible policies.

Despite the popularity of escooters, increases in rider injuries and fatalities have become a public health concern. Objective. To characterize the types of safety issues associated with e-scooter use. Methods. Scoping review methods focused on any safety issues associated with the use of dockless, stand-up, motorized, electric kick scooters from companies offering short-term rentals or through private ownership, published in English between January 2017 and March 2022. Databases included Academic Search Complete, Business Source Complete, Google Scholar, PsychINFO, PubMed, Scopus, SocINDEX, TRID Database, and Web of Science databases. After abstract screening and full text review, a total of 81 studies were included in the scoping review. Results. Few e-scooter riders wear helmets except where legally required. Alcohol impairment is a primary contributor to escooter injuries. Younger males, underage riding, double riding, speeding and rider distraction were also identified as behavioural contributors to e-scooter injury crashes. Environmental contributors included crash locations (e.g., sidewalks, bike paths, roads) parking issues (e.g., tripping hazard), fixed object collisions (e.g., lampposts, parked cars), road surface and slope (e.g., uneven, curbs, downhills) and insufficient nighttime visibility. E-scooter reliability was affected by brake failures and design limitations (e.g., stability over rough terrain). Injury patterns included mechanism of injury (loss of balance and/or control, fall) and moving object collisions (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, bicyclists). The head, face, upper and lower extremities were the most common anatomical locations injured. Fractures, contusions, concussions, lacerations, and sprains were the most frequent injury types. Discussion. Policies, regulations and interventions that address helmet requirements, alcohol and drug use, rider skill and knowledge acquisition, restrictive speed limits, education and enforcement are discussed with respect to evidence-based safety guidance for transportation policy and decision makers.

With the Modal Share Evaluation (MSE) algorithm supported by the Daily Activity Chain Optimization (DACO) framework, several variables, such as travel time, distance, and CO2 emissions, can be estimated for several future hypothetical scenarios. The data for the baseline scenario are derived from a historical dataset on travel patterns from the city, and respective estimations are made for future scenarios while considering five transport modes. The results indicate that a different prioritization of the adoption of transport modes for Budapest may result in various effects on the travelers' activity chains.

The necessity to provide improvements to public transport services and their spatial reach in order to reduce the number and volume of car trips in cities is irrefutable. The integration of micro- mobility and public transport is often presented as a valuable strategy to improve door-to-door connectivity and coverage of existing public transport services, via provision of key first- and last-mile or access-egress connections. The aim of this study was to understand and model the propensity of commuters in County Dublin to use micromobility (private and shared) in the first- and last-miles of their public transport journeys. A stated preference experiment was conducted with a focus on these specific segments of the journey and a mixed logit model was estimated to identify user characteristics and preferences based on socio-economic factors, mobility patterns and attitudes towards and previous experience of shared mobility. The results show that, in this particular case study, respondents with a strong walking preference were less likely to be interested in private micromobility and sharing services for the first- and last-mile. A common assumption that walking is a last resort, and only chosen when there are no other options available was not confirmed by the findings of this study. Moreover, competition between the modes showed that private bicycles are the preferred mode after walking, followed by private escooters, while shared modes were less likely to be chosen over walking, and shared e-scooters less so than shared bicycles. Overall, the findings suggest that a small percentage of the sample - mainly young (<35 years old) and male respondents with interest in and experience of e-scooters - were interested in using private and shared escooters for the first- and last-mile, but that the majority of the respondents were likely to choose walking, albeit with longer travel times overall.",Micromobility,Shared mobility,E -Scooters,Multimodality,"Carroll, Paraic",,,,,,First,and last-mile,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using AutoNavi population migration big data sets from web crawling, the spatiotemporal structure patterns of intercity travel in China from January 1st to June 30th, 2020 were extracted by using the singular value decomposition (SVD) method. Then the spatial organization patterns of intercity travel networks in China and its five major urban agglomerations were identified by the weighted stochastic block model (WSBM). The results showed that the total volume of intercity travel in China and its five major urban agglomerations experienced a process of rapid decline followed by a slow recovery, presenting a ""Vshaped"" distribution since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Three distinctive intercity travel patterns, namely the stable, holiday, and weekday-weekend intercity trip patterns, were extracted from the spatiotemporal OD matrix of intercity travel. Strong intercity travels were mainly distributed in eastern and central China, forming an intercity travel pattern in which core cities pushed and pulled each other within the national urban agglomerations. However, intercity migration flows were dominated by weak-intensity flows. Intercity trips during the holidays had a phenomenon of ""escaping from the metropolis"". Meanwhile, it had significant spatial proximity and directionality. The daily intercity trips were characterized by a remarkable periodicity with seven days as a repeat. A more interesting finding is that when weekends overlap with holidays, intercity travel on the 1-2 days before the vacations has presented an effect of ""suppression travel"". Furthermore, at the national scale, the stable intercity travel network has formed a polycentric core-periphery structure of ""Three Cores-Six Semiperipheries-Five Peripheries"".

Using the case of Shenzhen, a Chinese megacity with strong governmental control on mobility and a historical legacy of urban segregation, this study aims to achieve a nuanced understanding of the mechanism through which operators, regulators, and users of dockless bicycle sharing interact to produce and reproduce inequalities in accessing and using the service. To achieve this, this study adopts a mixed-method approach consisting of GIS mapping analysis, survey, and interviews with cyclists and experts. The result shows that both the use frequency and perceived accessibility of dockless bicycles are higher in wealthier and more central neighbourhoods. Moreover, strong governmental regulation in the form of a designated parking system, fleet quota distribution and point-based service evaluation have reproduced and enhanced spatial inequalities in dockless bicycle use and access. The findings contribute to the literature by demonstrating how preexisting urban infrastructure and certain regulatory arrangements interact to form a reproduction cycle of inequalities in accessing and using dockless bicycles that favours more central and well-off neighbourhoods at the expense of marginalized communities in Shenzhen.",Bicycle sharing,Dockless bicycle,Regulation,Inequality,,,,,,,Transportation equity,Mobility justice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CMGraphs model employs dynamic node features that store temporal crowd flow information, while the time-invariant edges represent spatial connectivity of locations of interests in the surrounding space. The spatiotemporal formulation using the CMGraphs allows for crowd flow prediction.

Although many global cities have attempted to implement this idea, there is still a lack of quantitative research on n-minute cities. This study aims to analyze factors that influence living radii by utilizing mobile phone location-based mobility big data and spatial regression analysis, thereby contributing to the implementation of n-minute cities. By distinguishing between pre- and post-COVID-19 periods and between commuting and non-commuting travel, this study reveals decreased average travel distances in the post-pandemic period and identifies factors influencing living radii, thereby favoring the concept of n-minute cities. During the post-COVID-19 period, the impact of factors such as population density, commercial facilities, and the job-housing ratio on travel distance has shifted, while neighborhood living and cultural facilities maintain consistent influence. This underscores the importance of prioritizing these aspects in n-minute city planning. Additionally, the mix of residential and business uses consistently affects shorter commuting distances, highlighting its critical role in n-minute city development.

Consequently, governments are closing such centers to fulfill climate and carbon neutrality goals. However, such closures risk populations being forced to travel further to facilities that collect waste, and can cause an unfair burden on the remaining open centers, thereby reducing participation in recycling. Using a facility location optimization model and mobility survey data within the state of Bavaria in Germany, we show how selective closures of these centers can still lead to high levels of recycling access. Our analysis ensures that even when 20% of facilities are closed smartly, the median travel distance by residents to their assigned recycling center increases by only 450 m. Additionally, we find Bavaria suffers from disparity in recycling patterns in rural and urban regions, both in terms of motivation to recycle and the locations of the facilities. We promote a policy that favors retention of recycling centers in rural regions by reserving 75% of open facilities to be in rural areas, while selectively closing facilities in urban regions, to remove these regional differences. Success of recycling campaigns depends on public perception of closures of such facilities and also on their ease of access. As policymakers gradually implement further closures, such data-driven strategies can assist in being more transparent to the public thereby increasing the willingness to participate in such recycling programs.",facility location optimization,policy reforms,recycling centers,rural-urban disparity,,,,,,,sustainability,waste management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, little consideration has been given to temporal dynamics, although research suggests that greenery benefits are not uniformly distributed over different seasons or daytimes. In this study, we aimed to fill these knowledge gaps by systematically assessing travel and residential greenery in 86 European cities. Moreover, we quantified the impact of seasonality and variation in daytime length by using an open data approach at the pan-European level. First, we compared travel and residential greenery using monthly NDVI composites derived from high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. In addition, we explored the temporal dynamics of greenery and adjusted NDVI values accordingly. The results demonstrated that travel environments have significantly lower greenery levels than residential environments in European cities. Overall, we found a latitudinal gradient from low to high travel greenery in southern Europe compared to Nordic cities. The findings also indicated that accounting for temporal variations, especially in northeastern Europe, has significant impact on the measured availability of travel greenery. We conclude that travel environment greenery and temporal variations should not be overlooked in exposure studies because they can lead to a biased understanding of greenery availability and related spatial disparities.

It is known that the built environment can influence travel attitudes and choice, yet the empirical evidence for the role of built environment features in shaping the bicycle-metro integration remains rare. Inspired by the idea of text mining, this article is an attempt to demonstrate a data-driven semantic framework to capture key topic-based features of land use and bicycle-metro integrated usage in the vicinity of metro stations as well as their interactions. Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling is analogously implemented here to generate a range of probability-based land use patterns and mobility patterns, and the associations between them are investigated by multivariate linear regression. A case study from Shanghai shows that the mixed land use and diversification of urban functions in the catchment areas of the metro stations can be detected effectively by 11 identified land use patterns. Based on 7 derived mobility patterns, this paper gives a probabilistic explanation to the time-varying properties of the bicycle-metro usage. All of the above thematic topics exhibit notably heterogeneous patterns in spatial distribution. The topic compositions in terms of land use pattern and mobility pattern at the station level reveal the current performance of station areas. Plus, results from the regression analysis confirm that most of the land use patterns that are related to various mixed use have close relationships with mobility patterns of bicycle-metro integration. Yet it is noteworthy that the effects of land use patterns often differ and change over time, namely affecting different mobility patterns.

Thus, this study investigates the privacy-preserving capabilities of third-party free mechanisms protecting trajectories by exclusively targeting the temporal dimension.

Furthermore, we present a Markov chain-based speed perturbation technique that preserves dynamic patterns while obfuscating travel times and motion attributes. Using simulated re-identification attacks, we analyze privacy gains and contrast them with the utility loss.

A sample of 190 key informants (taxi drivers, bus drivers and bike riders) were interviewed using questionnaires complemented by focus group discussions with relevant transport authorities notably transport agency operators, transport delegates, traffic police department and transport syndicate leaders. The key findings reveal a drastic decline in passenger demand for public transport during the pandemic period, a drastic reduction in bus/taxi occupancy leading to a steep decline in intra-urban and inter-urban mobility, and a drop in the income situation of bus and taxi drivers. Transport operators lay off workers at bus terminals stemming from low turnovers.

To address this issue, this study proposes a comprehensive framework of modeling curbside usage by multimodal transportation in a general dynamic network. The framework encapsulates route choices, curb space competition, and interactive effects among different curb users, and it embeds the dynamics of curb usage into a mesoscopic dynamic network model. Furthermore, a curb-aware dynamic origin-destination demand estimation framework is proposed to reveal the network-level spatiotemporal mobility patterns associated with curb usage through a physics-informed data-driven approach. The framework integrates emerging real-world curb use data in conjunction with other mobility data represented on computational graphs, which can be solved efficiently using the forward-backward algorithm on large-scale networks.

The results show that the macro, meso-, and microscales network characteristics of attraction networks have inherent logical relationships that can explain the commonalities and differences in the development process of tourism networks. The macroscale attraction network degree Matthew effect is significant in the four different periods and exhibits a morphological monocentric structure, suggesting that new entrants are more likely to be associated with attractions that already have high value. The mesoscale links attractions according to the common purpose of tourists, and the results of the community segmentation of the attraction networks in the four different periods suggest that the functional polycentric structure describes their clustering effect, and the weak links between clusters result from attractions bound by incomplete information and distance, and the functional polycentric structure with a generally more efficient network of clusters. The pattern structure at the microscale reveals the topological transformation relationship of the regional collaboration pattern, and the attraction network structure in the four different periods has a very similar importance profile structure suggesting that the attraction network has the same construction rules and evolution mechanism, which aids in understanding the attraction network pattern at both macro and micro scales. Important approaches and practical implications for planners and managers are presented.",attraction network,travel mobility,polycentric structure,network motif,"Mei, Lin","Wang, Zhaobo",,,,,connectivity mechanism,destination management organization (DMO),,destination planning,"Beijing, China",,,,,,,,,,,,,

As human mobility and commuting patterns are key components of communicable disease spread, we introduce a novel travel time aware metapopulation model. Our model aims to enhance estimations of disease transmission. By providing more reliable assessments on the efficacy of interventions, curtailing personal rights or human mobility behavior through interventions can be minimized. The proposed model is an advancement over traditional compartmental models, integrating explicit transmission on travel and commute, a factor available in agent-based models but often neglected with metapopulation models. Our approach employs a multi-edge graph ODE-based (Graph-ODE) model, which represents the intricate interplay between mobility and disease spread. This granular modeling is particularly important when assessing the dynamics in densely connected urban areas or when heterogeneous structures across entire countries have to be assessed. The given approach can be coupled with any kind of ODE-based model. In addition, we propose a novel multi-layer waning immunity model that integrates waning of different paces for protection against mild and severe courses of the disease. As this is of particular interest for late-phase epidemic or endemic scenarios, we consider the late-phase of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany. The results of this work show that accounting for resolved mobility significantly influences the pattern of outbreaks. The improved model provides a refined tool for predicting outbreak trajectories and evaluating intervention strategies in relation to mobility by allowing us to assess the transmission that result on traveling. The insights derived from this model can serve as a basis for decisions on the implementation or suspension of interventions, such as mandatory masks on public transportation. Eventually, our model contributes to maintaining mobility as a social good while reducing exuberant disease dynamics potentially driven by travel activities.",,,,,"Kerkmann, David","Schengen, Alain","Diexer, Sophie","Mikolajczyk, Rafael","Meyer-Hermann, Michael","Kuehn, Martin J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using survey data and interview data with dockless bike users in Shenzhen, China, this study explores users' perspectives on data extraction in dockless bikeshare with both quantitative and qualitative methods. The result indicate that socio-demographic backgrounds, mobility patterns and location of residence have significant impacts on users' attitudes to sharing data with dockless bike operators. In addition, a considerable portion of bikeshare users in Shenzhen on the one hand normalise data extraction while on the other problematise receiving financial compensation for their data.

Therefore, this case study of a Brazilian university examines the relationships among these factors, using a structural equation modeling approach with multiple indicators and multiple causes (SEM-MIMIC), based on perception data from public transport users within the academic community. The results indicate the importance of incorporating safety perception into travel satisfaction models and considering the interaction between infrastructure and public transport operation attributes. It is also crucial to account for the attributes of the environment in which university students travel. Furthermore, the findings show that user perceptions are influenced by factors such as gender, vehicle availability, total travel time, and the adequacy of the service to cope with specific needs.

In particular, micro E-Mobility tools such as E-scooters and E-bikes, play a pivotal role in this transition, offering sustainable alternatives for urban commuters. However, the energy consumption patterns for these tools are a critical aspect that impacts their effectiveness in real-world scenarios and is essential for trip planning and boosting user confidence in using these. To this effect, recent studies have utilised physical models customised for specific mobility tools and conditions, but these models struggle with generalization and effectiveness in real-world scenarios due to a notable absence of open datasets for thorough model evaluation and verification. To fill this gap, our work presents an open dataset, collected in Dublin, Ireland, specifically designed for energy modelling research related to E-Scooters and E-Bikes. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of energy consumption modelling based on the dataset using a set of representative machine learning algorithms and compare their performance against the contemporary mathematical models as a baseline.

First pilot implementations were originally station-based, so that trips needed to be station-to-station. This configuration created implementation difficulties in many cities and higher infrastructure costs for operating agencies. The appearance of free-floating on-street systems eased these limitations and implied an important growth of car- sharing implementations. In spite of these, free-floating systems are not free of planning and operative difficulties, which if not addressed carefully, might imply the economical unsustainability of the system. The idea of mixed systems, where a free-floating system and a station-based system complement each other, is new. The objective is to exploit the potentialities of both designs, while limiting their respective drawbacks. This paper presents a parsimonious model from which to derive the optimal strategical design variables for mixed car- sharing systems (i.e. the vehicle fleet size, the number of stations and the required intensity of rebalancing operations). This requires an integrated view of the system, allowing the optimization of the trade-off between the costs incurred by the operating agency and the level of service offered to users. The approach is based on the modelling technique of continuous approximations, which requires strong simplifications but allows obtaining very clear trade-offs and insights. The model has been applied to a case study taking the parameters from the city of Barcelona. Results prove the profitability of mixed car-sharing systems, which in particular contexts, is higher than that of pure free-floating or pure station-based systems on their own. Furthermore, if electrical cars are used, results show that battery recharging will not imply an active restriction to the system configuration. In conclusion, the proposed modeling approach represents a tool for the strategic design of car-sharing systems in the planning phase and provides guidelines for their adequate development, contributing to a more sustainable urban mobility.",Car-sharing,Electric vehicles,Facility location problem,Rebalancing,,,,,,,Optimization,Continuous approximation,,Barcelona,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper explores whether and how exploratory scenario narratives and participatory mapping processes can establish a reciprocal relationship, wherein narrative-based maps contribute to spatially shaping scenario narratives. It uses an experimental approach involving three participatory workshops with experts and local stakeholders specifically tailored to the mapping of land use and transportation-related scenario narratives for the year 2050 in the Henares Corridor (Madrid, Spain). The spatial transformations mapped during workshops have indicated that participatory mapping processes have an impact on scenario narratives in different ways, enabling the identification of three categories of mapping episodes with different meanings: (i) complementing narratives, (ii) expanding narratives, and (iii) modifying narratives.

However, several factors lead to the emergence of fragile and disintegrated systems, where several subsystems work under different schemes of formality. In this context, transit travel tends to be highly multimodal, which at the trip level has been scarcely studied. In this study, the metropolitan geography of the primary forms of Transit Mode Combinations (TMCs) is explored for the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) based on data from the 2017 Household Origin -Destination Survey (HODS17). Transit travel is disaggregated to analyze its multimodality, its link with location, as well as its sociodemographic profiles. The most frequent TMCs are compared regarding average travel distances and speed, and their ridership rates are mapped. A regression model is used to test the socioeconomic and urban form correlates of the TMCs. The results show that transit multimodality has a specific geographical pattern by TMCs. Most Metro users are not those residing close to its stations but those having these stations at their trip destination. Travel by Metro shows a stronger association with decreasing Colectivo ridership than with travel by Bus Rapid Transit (BRT).

However, little has been done to empirically investigate the associations between female commute cost and labor supply before the driving ban was lifted. This is largely due to the data scarcity on disaggregated-level female mobility patterns and travel behaviors. To fill the gap, this study deployed a space-time framework to identify suspicious female roundtrip commuters whose majority of taxi trips were between home and workplaces based on about one million e-hailing O-D data from female passengers in Riyadh. Her commute costs (i.e., distance, time, out-ofpocket cost, commute burden) and labor supply information (i.e., work hours, skill-job mismatch) were then inferred by supplementing neighborhood-level Census data and open data on major female employers. Overall, female riders had significantly longer travel distance/time and higher out-of-pocket costs than male passengers. Though no causal statements were made, higher commute burden was related to lower Saudi female employment rate and longer working hours, while lower burden was associated with higher skill-job mismatch in terms of over-education, confirming our hypotheses that well-educated Saudi females might 1) choose not to work, 2) extend hours of work to offset travel costs, or 3) switch to nearby jobs with lower wage and skill-job match. Therefore, females' restricted mobility became a non-negligible job market friction. Meanwhile, females worked in the manufacturing sector could pay more than 75% of her wages on e-taxis, implying a sector-specific spatial mismatch issue. Our findings provide a useful baseline on the female travel cost and labor supply situations before the lifting of driving ban. It enables comparative studies to understand the impacts of ongoing women empowerment for mobility and employment autonomy.

This paper proposes new indicators derived from the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) dynamics before and after a disruption to evaluate its impact on traffic resilience. Considering that MFD is an intrinsic property of a homogeneously congested transportation network, the resilience losses due to congestion and network disruption are measured separately. The resilience loss is defined as the reduction in trip completion rate, comparing congested cases to uncongested cases or disrupted cases to undisrupted cases. The resilience loss hence also exists for an undisrupted network and is measurable by the proposed method. A Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) model is calibrated by real origin-destination patterns, to allow for experiments in scenarios of different demand variations and supply disruptions. Case studies are conducted in Munich, Germany and Kyoto, Japan to test the usefulness of the newly proposed indicators. We furthermore explore the relationship between resilience loss and network topological attributes such as centrality and connectivity from a variety of synthetic disruption experiments in Munich and Kyoto. We find that the resilience loss in a grid -like network as in Kyoto is less dependent on the degradation of network connectivity than in a ring -like network as in Munich.",Traffic resilience,Macroscopic fundamental diagram,Infrastructure disruption,Traffic simulation,"Dai, Jiannan","Schmoecker, Jan -Dirk","Antoniou, Constantinos",,,,Network topology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, the welfare and distributional impacts of pricing have largely been studied in the context of passenger travel whereas freight has received relatively less attention. In this paper, we examine the impacts of several congestion pricing schemes on both passenger transport and freight in an integrated manner using a large-scale microsimulator (SimMobility) that explicitly simulates the behavioral decisions of the entire population of individuals and business establishments, dynamic multimodal network performance, and their interactions. Through simulations of a prototypical North American city, we find that a distance-based pricing scheme yields larger welfare gains than an area-based scheme, although the gains are a modest fraction of toll revenues (around 30%). In the absence of revenue recycling or redistribution, distancebased and cordon-based schemes are found to be particularly regressive. On average, lower income individuals lose as a result of the scheme, whereas higher income individuals gain. A similar trend is observed in the context of shippers - small establishments having lower shipment values lose on average whereas larger establishments with higher shipment values gain.

However, research examining the relationship between residential location choice and COVID-19 is very limited. To that end, this paper focuses on how pandemic-induced changes in work patterns, travel preferences and daily activity patterns have altered residential preferences and potentially, relocation trends. The main determinants of residential location choice have been established in the literature over the past 30 years: physical attributes of the dwelling; surrounding built environment; affordability; and accessibility to transportation, workplaces, and services. However, each of these determinants are prioritised differently depending on the circumstances. Therefore, exploring how these priorities have shifted after the pandemic can pave the way for understanding how preferences for residential location choice shift as a consequence. From the review, the key findings include the decreasing importance of transport and workplace accessibility in residential location choice after the pandemic. Firstly, teleworking is becoming more prevalent within office jobs than before the pandemic, leading to less frequent trips to conventional workplaces, reducing the need to live within a commutable distance to a workplace. Secondly, trips to other activities have likewise become less frequent due to either remote alternatives (e. g., online shopping) or shifting towards services closer to home, reducing the need to travel in general. Another consequence of the pandemic is people staying at home longer than before, thus increasing the need for more desirable dwelling attributes such as larger house size and wider surrounding green space. Since these attributes are generally more affordable in areas less accessible to transport and services, this may subsequently lead to migrations to areas of lower population density, potentially decentralising urban areas.",Residential location choice,Urban decentralisation,Travel behaviour,Activity behaviour,"Fountas, Grigorios","Mora, Luca",,,,,COVID-19,Post -pandemic,,Teleworking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding these issues is crucial for promoting social equity and justice, and planning more inclusive cities. Prior research has predominantly emphasized residential ethnoracial diversity but has often overlooked or inadequately addressed ethnoracial diversity and segregation in individuals' daily activities and places they visit, due in part to data limitations. This study leverages a dynamic measure of ethnoracial diversity and dominance at the finest spatial scale, specifically at the Points of Interest (POI) level and various temporal contexts. Using one month of privacy-enhanced mobile phone location data in Los Angeles County, California, this study explores ethnoracial diversity and spatial segregation simultaneously in POI visits in LA County. Our findings confirm that individuals' daily mobility in urban areas enhances ethnoracial mixing at activity locations. Empirical results indicate that the diversity of visitors to a POI is significantly higher than the neighborhood diversity where the same POI is located. A significant positive linear relationship was found between the neighborhood diversity of POIs and the diversity of visitors. About 34 % of the variance in the diversity of visitors to POIs can be explained by the neighborhood diversity of POIs. Our results also suggest significant spatial clusters of isolated/integrated areas regarding ethnoracial mixing in people's daily activity locations. Notably, the Hispanic or Latino population tends to stay in their own communities and experiences a higher level of segregation in their daily activity locations.

As an important composition, modern ride-hailing platforms allow citizens to order taxis in a fast, simple, and secure manner. The key to developing a successful ride-hailing system largely depends on efficient fleet management that narrows the demand-supply gap. For this reason, many Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) frameworks are becoming increasingly popular for proactive taxi dispatching. However, existing approaches have very coarse formulations and solutions to the dispatching problem, which overly simplify the real situations. To this end, we propose a fine-grained DRL framework for effective taxi dispatching with tractable solutions.

To reduce the status space and environment dynamics, we cluster regions based on their daily moving patterns and allow agents in the same cluster to learn cooperatively by sharing their policies, i.e., learning from like-pattern peers. 2) We further employ a recurrent neural network to forecast the demand and supply, which helps the agents make globally optimal decisions 3) Finally, we design a two-phase central dispatching strategy based on Maximum Network Flow to relocate taxis in fine granularity. We conduct extensive experiments in a realistic environment simulator using a real-world dataset, and the results demonstrate the superior performance of our new framework over existing approaches, promoting the average total order response rate by 2.67% , taxi effort gain by 25.77% , and decreasing the average number of repositions by 2.96% .",Taxi dispatching,clustering,reinforcement learning,urban computing,"Javed, Muhammad Hafeez","Alhaek, Fares","Li, Tianrui",,,,multi-agent learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meanwhile, spatial and temporal heterogeneities often lead to constantly evolving dynamics in in passenger demand, e.g., passengers may exhibit different mobility patterns at different periods or in different regions. Many models fail to capture these heterogeneities and adjust parameters adaptively, leading to suboptimal prediction results. In this paper, we propose a novel space-time adaptive network (STAN) to address these issues. Spatially, an edge-based backbone with a global receptive field is devised. Edge embeddings directly represent pair-wise relations between regions, preserving more fine-grained information and directional interactions. The backbone adaptively updates edge embeddings by fusing static and dynamic information from origin and destination regions, enabling the model to learn intricate spatial relations from simple input data (i.e., basic relation graphs and historical OD matrices). Temporally, a prompter mechanism is proposed to inject temporal information into model parameters, making them timedependent. The parameter values exhibit periodicity and continuity for all periods, meanwhile, they can be adjusted for each specific period. It makes the model time-aware and enables it to identify similar periods and differentiate dissimilar ones during training. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets (i.e., ten-month taxi trips in New York and one-month ride-hailing trips in Ningbo), and the results demonstrate that our model outperforms baseline models and automatically learns certain spatial and temporal semantics.

This study uses observation data from iNaturalist, an online social network of voluntary users sharing biodiversity information, which was collected from 20,434 parks in the United States. It explores the relationship between park characteristics and the mean travel distance of users to parks. The latter is based on the average of distances between an iNaturalist user's typical main area of iNaturalist contributions and the locations of the user's observations falling inside a park of interest. The DBSCAN clustering algorithm is used to determine each user's main contribution area. An Eigenvector Spatial Filtering (ESF) model shows that the log of the average distance travelled to parks is positively associated with certain park management types (e.g. National Parks, State Parks) and biodiversity, but negatively associated with the population around a park. The results provide insights into the nature of iNaturalist user visitation patterns to parks which can be used for targeted outreach campaigns and a more user-centric approach to promote park attractions and biodiversity conservation.",Crowdsourcing,travel distance,park,iNaturalist,,,,,,,,,27TH AGILE CONFERENCE ON GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SCIENCE GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SCIENCE FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conducting management for such a hybrid multi-modal system faces various challenges, including the complex interactions between bike-sharing and other modes, highly dynamic passenger demand, and the difficulty of accessing direct transfer data. To overcome such difficulties, our study proposes a framework for assessing the dependency between the two usage modes. Firstly, a Dynamic-Time-Warping-based (DTW) method is utilized to determine the catchment area (CA) between the two modes, allowing the BnR-related tendency similarity under a given time scale to be considered. Then, the patterns of probabilistic dependence between travel demand of the two modes are obtained by a copula-based approach, which separates correlations under specific usage levels from single modal demands. A case study on the multi-modal system formed by docked bike-sharing and subway in New York is conducted to validate the proposed framework. The tendency similarity is found to be most pronounced within 500 m on average under a 4-hour interval. For each formed station group (SG), the best-fitted copula type is selected, capturing the strong tail correlations present only at specific usage levels. The results show a variety of different correlation patterns within SGs, despite the close geographic locations they may share. Areas of potential transfer resistance between the two modes are identified, which is more evident in first-milerelated (FMR) activities. In contrast, the two modes display more weak connections in last-mile-related (LMR) activities. The obtained results can be utilized by bike-sharing service providers to analyze demand distributions and conduct efficient station-level rebalancing. Compared to previous methods, our proposed framework is computationally inexpensive since no direct transfer of data or complex inference network is required. It incorporates statistically significant spatial-temporal information, allowing for a more accurate determination of the bi-modal assessment range. Moreover, considering that single-mode influences are mathematically removed, the resulting correlation in principle links to the strength of the connections between the two modes. Therefore, it can be assessed as an indicator of the reliability of the multi-modal system.",Docked bike-sharing,Multi-modal system,Catchment area,Demand dependence,"Zhu, Zheng","Yang, Hai",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These networks are often characterized by the presence of complex structures such as central loops paired with peripheral branches, which can appear both in natural and manmade systems, such as subway and railway networks. In this study, we investigate the conditions for the emergence of these nontrivial topological structures in the context of human transportation in cities. We propose a simple model for spatial networks generation, where a network lattice acts as a planar substrate and edge speeds define an effective temporal distance which we aim to optimize and quantifies the efficiency in exploring the urban space. Complex network topologies can be recovered from the optimization of edges' speeds and we study how the interplay between a flow probability between two nodes in space and the associated travel cost influences the resulting optimal network. In the perspective of urban transportation we simulate these flows by means of human mobility models to obtain origin-destination matrices. We find that when using simple lattices, the obtained optimal topologies transition from treelike structures to more regular networks, depending on the spatial range of flows. Remarkably, we find that branches paired to large loops structures appear as optimal structures when the network is optimized for an interplay between heterogeneous mobility patterns of small range travels and longer-range ones typical of commuting. Moreover, when congestion dynamics in traffic routing is considered, we study the emergence of additional edges from the tree structure to mitigate temporal delays. Finally, we show that our framework is able to recover the statistical spatial properties of the Greater London area subway network.",,,,,"Gallotti, Riccardo","Lepri, Bruno","De Domenico, Manlio",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, the biological activities of AMF were concurrently compromised. Biochar (BC), as an abiotic factor, had the potential compensate for this limitation. To elucidate the synergistic effects of biotic and abiotic factors, a pot experiment was conducted to assess the impact of biochar and AMF on the growth, physiological traits, and genetic expression in rice plants subjected to Cd stress. The results demonstrated that biochar significantly increased the mycorrhizal colonization rate by 22.19 %, while the combined application of biochar and AMF led to a remarkable enhancement of rice root biomass by 42.2 %. This resulted in a shift in spatial growth patterns that preferentially promoted enhanced underground development. Biochar effectively mitigated the stomatal limitations imposed by Cd on photosynthetic processes. The decrease in IBRv2 (Integrated Biomarker Response version 2) values suggested that the antioxidant system was experiencing a state of remission. An increase of Cd content within the rice root systems was observed, ranging from 33.71 % to 48.71 %, accompanied by a reduction in Cd bioavailability and mobility curtailed its translocation to the aboveground tissues. Under conditions of low soil Cd concentration (Cd <= 1 mg center dot kg 1 ), the Cd content in rice seeds from the group subjected to the combined treatment remained below the national standard (Cd <= 0.2 mg center dot kg 1 ). Furthermore, the combined treatment modulated the uptake of Fe and Zn by rice, while simultaneously suppressing the expression of genes associated with Cd transport.

We focused on the Texas Triangle, which includes Austin, Houston, San Antonio, and the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area. Using EV registration data, our study applied unsupervised machine learning techniques, specifically hierarchical clustering analysis, to identify distinct patterns of EV adoption. We conducted a longitudinal analysis to investigate changes in carmakers' market share and to understand EV adoption patterns over time. We used Anselin Local Moran's I analysis to profile the characteristics of Tesla owners. Our analysis results revealed significant market segmentation in the EV market, particularly between different sale price ranges and brands. Notably, Tesla emerged as a market leader with strong brand appeal in the mid to high price tiers. EV adoption has been spreading from the Texas Triangle. Clusters with overall high EV registration, as identified in Anselin Local Moran's I analysis, were more associated with high-income, highly educated communities, where residents own multiple vehicles and are predominantly White. This trend was also observed among Tesla owners in relative to low-tier EV adopters. The mismatch exists between the density of registered EVs and the availability of both public and Tesla charging stations, with a notable disparity between urban centers and outskirts. More importantly, we highlight the reluctance of disadvantaged groups to purchase EVs, regardless of price or brand, underscoring the need for policy interventions that address distributive fairness.

However, in the era of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), it is prospective to enhance traffic control precision and achieve vehicle coordination in a more efficient manner. Focusing on an isolated intersection, this study proposes an innovative concept of Fine-grained Phase (FP) for CAV-enabled traffic control, which realizes more refined right-of-way allocation than traditional signal phases while preserving the simplicity and scalability. The development of FP jointly optimizes traffic control strategy and intersection layout design to fully utilize time -space resources, and multiple forms of FP could be generated in response to various traffic demands; meanwhile, vehicle coordination is achieved in an offline-online manner to balance solution quality and efficiency. Under the FP -based control, each lane is assigned with periodical entry time points using FP design results, then vehicles are supposed to catch up with the appropriate time points to fulfill their trips. Theoretical analyses are conducted under stationary vehicle arrival patterns, where the average delay and the intersection capacity associated with different forms of FP can be analytically acquired. For the implementation of FP -based control, we construct a general offline-online framework, consisting of an offline model that optimizes the geometry of the conflict zone at intersections and the control strategy of vehicles simultaneously, which is formulated as a mixed -integer linear programming problem, and an online FP adoption mechanism that can adapt to varying demand patterns. Under the framework, limited online computation is required, facilitating its practical real-time implementation. Simulation studies under a variety of demand settings show that FP -based control is advantageous over benchmark methods in reducing vehicle delay and also improving intersection capacity in most cases; even for cases with extremely imbalanced demands, FP -based control can admit comparable throughput, while the average delay is much smaller. In addition, results of computation time reveal that FP -based control could realize real-time implementation with negligible computation burden.",Fine-grained phase,Intersection control,Geometry design,Connected and automated vehicles,"Lin, Xi","Li, Meng",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the pursuit of reaching peak carbon and carbon neutrality goals, it is essential to quantify carbon emissions and evaluate carbon reduction strategies. To establish a high-precision observation with full time series and spatial coverage, a spatio-temporal interpolation method was developed to obtain XCO2 data over mainland China at a resolution of 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees for the years 2015-2021. An east-west gradient, higher levels in the east and lower levels in the west, was observed, exhibiting a seasonal pattern of elevation in spring and reduction in summer. Subsequently, the research area is classified into seven clusters based on time-series XCO2 anomalies (Delta XCO2) and ODIAC (Open Source Data Inventory of Anthropogenic Carbon Dioxide) carbon emission data. This classification aims to emphasize the differentiation of spatial heterogeneity in carbon emissions and the results highlight that regions with high Delta XCO2 reflect higher carbon emission. Finally, the carbon emissions of each cluster were estimated by using a random forest model individually yielding an R2 of approximately 0.6. For assessing the variables influencing carbon emission predictions, the importance of each variable was calculated. Specifically, NightTime Lighting data (NTL), representing human production activities, emerged as a crucial variable influencing carbon emission predictions in most clusters. In comparison, Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) is considered a more critical variable in Southwest China (SWC), primarily owing to the intricate vegetation carbon sink system in this region. Temperature (T) emerges as a key variable influencing the estimation of carbon emissions in certain developed cities in Eastern China (EC), driven by the urban heat island effect which amplifies energy consumption, modifies land use, and impacts urban systems, influencing the spatial patterns of carbon emissions.

These groups are characterized by their distinctive use of five travel modes (i.e., single-occupant vehicles, carpooling, public transit, biking, and walking) for both work and non-work trips. Two of these groups are more car-oriented and less multimodal (i.e., drive-alone users and carpoolers), whereas the other two are less car-oriented and display higher levels of multimodality (i.e., transit users and cyclists). Results from this study reveal the unique profiles of each traveler group in terms of their sociodemographic characteristics and built-environment attributes. The study further investigates the different characteristics of each traveler group in relation to ridehailing adoption, trip frequency and trip attributes. Transit users are found to have the highest rate of ridehailing adoption and usage. They are also more prone to use pooled ridehailing services in comparison to other groups. In terms of mode substitution, if ridehailing were not available, respondents tend to choose the mode they use most frequently. In other words, car-based travelers are more likely to substitute ridehailing trips with car trips, whereas non-car-based travelers are more likely to replace ridehailing with less-polluting modes. The findings from this study will prove valuable for transit agencies and policymakers interested in integrating ridehailing with other modes and promoting more multimodal and less car-dependent lifestyles.",Travel modality,Ridehailing,Latent-class cluster analysis,Mode substitution,"Young, Mischa","Compostella, Junia","Circella, Giovanni","Jenn, Alan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper aims to investigate the spatial distribution of the benthic diatom community in a poorly studied river catchment of the Tonle Sap Basin in Cambodia. Diatom samples were collected at nineteen (19) monitoring sites from 2018 to 2023 along the Sangker River, and the hierarchical clustering technique was applied to characterize the variation in diatom community structure based on the similarity of diatom genera composition. Seventy-eight (78) diatom genera belonging to 36 families, 18 orders, and 5 classes of diatom flora were recorded. Gomphonema Ehrenberg, Nitzschia Hassall, and Navicula Bory were the most dominant diatom genera in the catchment area. Accordingly, three main diatom assemblages (Ia, Ib, and II) were classified, and 11 indicator genera were identified. Indeed, the identified assemblages reflect the change of diatiom community composition from the upstream assemblage (Ia), middle course (Ib), and floodplain assemblage (II). Dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, conductivity (EC), total phosphorus (TP), and silicon dioxide (SiO2) were the physico-chemical determinants of benthic diatom communities, while physical factors (DO, pH, and nutrients) seemed to be more important than chemical factors. Consequently, any disturbances to the physical condition of the river would drive an abrupt shift in the diatom community's diversity and structure.

Moreover, these studies had limitations, such as the small amount of data for policy implications and the restricted geographic scope centered on western countries with minimal attention on Asian urban areas. To overcome such limitations, this research has aimed to identify clearer features of behavioral aspects of e-scooter sharing by utilizing credit card big data and conducting a mobile survey amongst users in Seoul including various time slots during the COVID-19 outbreak. The findings revealed two peak times for escooter sharing during the week with heightened activity on weekends and holidays. It was noted that e-scooter sharing substituted other modes of transportation from midnight to 05:00.

High levels of patronage and customer satisfaction were identified, but there was a need for fundamental facilities to support sustained usage. Although the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on e-scooter sharing usage, quantifying its extent has proven to be challenging. Weather conditions also influenced usage patterns, which varied across different regions.

Thanks to the pivotal role of pillar paradigms, such as edge/cloud computing, Internet of Things, and business process management, it is now possible to combine and translate these service-like resources into configurable workflows, to cope with users' complex needs. Examples include treatment workflows in smart healthcare, delivery plans in drone-based missions, transportation plans in smart urban networks, etc. Rather than composing atomic services to obtain these workflows, reusing existing process fragments has several advantages, mainly the fast, secure, and configurable compositions. However, reusing smart process fragments has not yet been addressed in the context of smart environments. In addition, existing solutions in smart environments suffer from the complexity (e.g., multi-modal transportation in smart mobility) and privacy issues caused by the heterogeneity (e.g., package delivery in smart economy) of aggregated services. Moreover, these services may be conflicting in specific domains (e.g. medication/treatment workflows in smart healthcare), and may affect user experience. To solve the above issues, the present paper aims to accelerate the process of generating configurable treatment workflows w.r.t. the users' requirements and their smart environment specificity. We exploit the principles of software reuse to map each sub-request into smart process fragments, which we combine using Cocke-Kasami-Younger (CKY) method, to finally obtain the suitable workflow.

Results show that knowing and using a route frequently has a positive effect on the likelihood of cycling in the dark.

Participants, aged between 18 and 70, with an average of M= 33 years, were drawn from all 17 regions of Spain, and responded to an electronic survey on commuting issues. Results: As hypothesized, different groups of commuters had different psychosocial trip- and welfare-related outcomes. Indeed, most indicators, except for travel satisfaction, showed a favorable association with the sustainability value attributed to each commuting means. Particularly, active travelers had significantly lower commuting stress and Body Mass Index (BMI) values, and higher rates of life satisfaction and pro-environmental behavior in areas beyond transport, in stark contrast to private motorized users. Public transport users, although 'in the middle' in most aspects, report the highest commuter stress rates. Conclusion: The results of this research endorse the assumption that the commuting mode matters, but the relationship between transport sustainability and user outcomes cannot be understood as 'totally linear'. These insights can be valuable for initiatives aimed at promoting shifts towards more sustainable -and active- transportation patterns among commuters, who constitute an interest group in current mobility planning and decision-making.",Commuters,Active commuting,Health,Psychosocial outcomes,"Marin, Cristina",,,,,,Transport sustainabilizing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite an increasing body of scholarship on this issue, the spatial and temporal disparities of the relationship between built environment and DBS usage are less discussed in existing literature. In particular, few studies have taken the coexistence of complementary and competitive relation between bike-sharing and existing transit systems into account. Using 250 m grid level data in Shenzhen, this study applied multi-scale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) to reveal the local effects of built environment on bike utilization. The results found that population and employment density are generally positively related to bike usage. A significant competitive effect on DBS is observed in areas with dense metro stations, while complementary effect is found in other areas. In addition, bus coverage is found to negatively affect bike usage, meaning that public bus would substitute bike-sharing to travel. Mixed land use can attract bike usage on weekday but not on weekend, while residential as well as commercial areas have the potential to generate more bike demand in urban center and inner suburbs but not in exurban areas. Conversely, industrial areas in suburbs contribute to bike usage. Furthermore, office building plays a critical and positive role in bike usage, especially in suburbs, whereas restaurant shows negative effects during peak times. This research sheds light on the relationships between built environment and travel behavior, and the findings can provide tailor-made policies towards cycling-friendly environment and sustainable transportation.",Dockless bike-sharing,Built environment,Travel behavior,Multi-scale geographically weighted regression,"Tu, Wei","Wu, Yuzhe",,,,,Spatiotemporal heterogeneity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such problems consist of optimizing vehicle routes according to passengers' demand for transportation under space and time restrictions (called requests). REQreate is flexible and can be configured to generate instances for a variety of problems types in this problem class. In this paper, we exemplify this with the Dial-a-Ride Problem (DARP) and On-demand Bus Routing Problem (ODBRP). In most of the literature, researchers either test their solution algorithms with instances based on artificial networks or they perform real-life case studies on instances derived from a specific city or region. Furthermore, locations of requests for on-demand transportation problems are mostly randomly chosen according to a uniform distribution, rather than being derived from actual data. The aim of REQreate is to overcome any shortcomings from synthetic or specific instances. Rather than relying on artificial or limited data, we retrieve real -world street networks from OpenStreetMaps (OSM). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first tool to make use of real-life networks to generate instances for an extensive catalog of existing and upcoming on-demand transportation problems. Additionally, we present a simple method that can be embedded in the instance generation process to produce distinct urban mobility patterns. We perform an analysis with real-life data sets reported by rideshare companies and compare them with properties of synthetic instances generated with REQreate. Another contribution of this work is the introduction of the concept of instance similarity that serves as support to create a set of diverse instances, in addition to properties (size, dynamism, urgency, and geographic dispersion) that can be used to comprehend which characteristics of the problem instances have an impact on the performance quality (or efficiency) of a solution algorithm.",Transportation,Instance generator,On-demand public transport,REQreate,"Soerensen, Kenneth",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study addresses a critical research gap by investigating the adherence to the ""priority-to-the-right"" rule at an urban unsignalized intersection, comparing behavioral patterns of cyclists and motorists. Utilizing stationary mounted cameras, a 12-day traffic observation of an urban T-intersection in Braunschweig, Germany, was conducted. The class and the trajectory of road users as well as their scenarios were identified. In 202 cases, cars appearing from the right (ego, with priority) encountered cars or bikes coming from the left (foe, without priority). The study analyzed the impact of variables, ego's direction, foe's class and lateral position and their arrival time on their passing order through descriptive statistics and logistic regression. The findings reveal that cyclists disregard the ""priority-to-the-right"" rule more often than motorists. Additionally, road users who have the priority are more likely to yield when turning right, arriving at the intersection later, and encountering an opposing road user who is close to the center of the road. This study highlights the importance of implicit communication in traffic and provides essential benchmarks for developing more human-like autonomous driving systems, capable of interpreting and responding to nuanced road user interactions at unsignalized intersections.",Unsignalized intersections,Trajectories,Implicit communication,Cooperation,,,,,,,VRU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, research on hybrid e-bike sharing, which combines station-based and dockless systems, is limited. This study addresses this gap by comparing spatial determinants of hybrid e-bike and dockless e-scooter sharing link flows in 32,965 street segments in Portland, Oregon during 2022, using gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) models. Distance to the city center emerges as the most important determinant for both modes, with closer proximity to the city center associated with higher link flows. Factors such as the presence and types of bike facilities, the availability of streetlights and street trees, and job density also significantly influence e-bike and e-scooter link flows. A notable difference between the two modes is that e-scooter trips are more sensitive to distance to the city center than e-bike trips. Furthermore, bike facilities have a greater impact on e-bike link flows, whereas job density is more influential in determining e-scooter link flows. These findings offer strategies for policymakers and urban planners to promote and manage shared micromobility and optimize the built environment. These strategies include enforcing higher device availability requirements in underprivileged neighborhoods, transitioning e-scooter sharing systems into a hybrid model, expanding the off-street bike trial network and bikeway network, and augmenting the coverage of streetlights and street trees along the bikeway network.",Shared micromobility,E -scooter,E -bike,Bikesharing,,,,,,,Built environment,GBDT,,Shared mobility,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our study, 200 participants, grouped into sessions of 10, engaged in a competitive serious game simulating 50 daily choices of travel mode and departure time across three automated options. Two scenarios were examined: one with recurring congestion and another with nonrecurring congestion. Automated transit had fixed schedules, while private and shared rides could adapt to a congested bottleneck. Results revealed that ridesharing dominated, reaching 60% mode share under recurring congestion, displacing transit, and a comparative equilibrium emerged between shared and private rides. In the nonrecurring congestion scenario, ridesharing dropped to 37%, and a comparable multimodal equilibrium developed. Participants rarely achieved the optimal score, attaining a maximum of 88% of its potential. This study highlights a policy paradox: unregulated AV traffic can reduce transit use, exacerbate recurring congestion, yet necessitate increased transit investment to address nonrecurring congestion, confirming the Downs-Thomson paradox.

Using a unique panel of Austrian workers, we find that job seekers do indeed accept jobs with significantly lower wages. However, the majority group of job seekers who used to commute to jobs located outside their municipality of residence tend to increasingly accept jobs in their home municipality, and do not necessarily broaden geographically their search. Based on quasi-experimental variations in the duration of unemployment benefits, we find that this evolution of commuting patterns is not linked to the loss of benefits. We explain these findings through the lens of a job search model where flexible parameters such as search costs are allowed to vary across space and time. We estimate that search costs are substantial and increase differently over time for local and non -local jobs, accounting for the patterns found in the data.

As the major component of the integrated transport system in most cities, taxi trips represent a large portion of residents' urban mobility. Thus, quantifying the impacts of COVID-19 on city-wide taxi demand can help to better understand the reshaped travel patterns, optimize public-transport operational strategies, and gather emergency experience under the pressure of this pandemic. To achieve the objectives, the Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression (GTWR) model is used to analyze the impact mechanism of COVID-19 on taxi demand in this study. City-wide taxi trip data from August 1st, 2020 to July 31st, 2021 in New York City was collected as model's dependent variables, and COVID-19 case rate, population density, road density, station density, points of interest (POI) were selected as the independent variables. By comparing GTWR model with traditional ordinary least square (OLS) model, temporally weighted regression model (TWR) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) model, a significantly better goodness of fit on spatial-temporal taxi data was observed for GTWR. Furthermore, temporal analysis, spatial analysis and the epidemic marginal effect were developed on the GTWR model results. The conclusions of this research are shown as follows: (1) The virus and health care become the major restraining and stimulative factors of taxi demand in post epidemic era. (2) The restraining level of COVID-19 on taxi demand is higher in cold weather. (3) The restraining level of COVID-19 on taxi demand is severely influenced by the curfew policy. (4) Although this virus decreases taxi demand in most of time and places, it can still increase taxi demand in some specific time and places. (5) Along with COVID-19, sports facilities and tourism become obstacles on increasing taxi demand in most of places and time in post epidemic era.

We assess whether school closures impact households' residential choices, over and above preexisting negative population trends that motivate school closures. Our findings indicate that municipalities affected by school closures experience significant reductions in population and income. The effect is primarily driven by peripheral municipalities located far away from economic centres and distant from the next available primary school.

This paper examines and compares the changes in public transit and ride-hailing ridership in Chicago during the COVID-19 pandemic, investigating 'who' stopped using transit and Transportation Network Company (TNC) services from a demographic perspective, how remote work relates to changes in transit use, how pandemic ridership changes are clustered in space, and what factors will impact a return to regular travel.

Continued transit use is correlated with areas with a greater percentage of African American and Spanish-speaking people, and with a greater percentage of pre-pandemic bus riders and off-peak riders, while peak-period, frequent, and rail system riders stopped using transit to the greatest extent. Areas with a higher share of young, college-educated people, and those with a high walkability metric, generally saw the greatest decreases in TNC use, reflecting a potential loss of trips for those who used TNCs to access social events or employment, and moved to virtual work during COVID-19.

Distinct from most existing works that focus on fully autonomous vehicles, we envision a more foreseeable future where ride -hailing platform utilizes a fleet of level -4 AVs to provide mobility -on -demand services in selected areas of the city, complemented by a group of for -hire drivers who can pick up or drop off passengers outside of the AV's service area. The platform not only makes planning decisions regarding the selection of service area of AVs, but also makes operational decisions regarding the ride fares, driver compensations, fleet size, and vehicle relocation strategies, etc., while interacting with passengers and for -hire human drivers on the transportation network. The overall profit -maximization problem of the platform is formulated as a mixed -integer nonlinear program, which is highly non -convex and difficult to address. To tackle this challenge, we developed a decomposition -based algorithm that can compute a near -optimal solution for the optimization problem, while offering a theoretical upper bound on the gap between the derived solution and the unknown globally optimal solution. The proposed method is validated in a numerical study for San Francisco. We show that activating level -4 AVs in selected areas (instead of over the entire network) can improve the platform profit by up to 20%. We also observe that as the cost of AV infrastructures reduces, the spatial diffusion of AV services will follow an interesting pattern, where the platform will first activate all high -demand zones for AV services simultaneously, and then progressively expand AV services to other areas one zone after another as a result of the complex trade-off between demand levels, activation cost, and network connectivity. We further evaluate the impacts of AV diffusion on human drivers and passengers and demonstrate that (a) human drivers will first be incentivized to relocate to lower -demand areas and then be forced to leave the TNC market if the cost of AV infrastructure continues to decline; (b) passengers in remote areas will surprisingly experience higher trip costs even though the cost of AV decreases, particularly after AV is activated in urban areas but before it is activated in remote areas.

Place-based models attribute this spatial disparity to hazard, exposure, and social-vulnerability factors. However, the impact of migration on seismic fatality remains underexplored, primarily due to the challenges of accessing mobility data. In this study, we apply a geospatial method, the radiation model, to estimate migration patterns as a critical component of exposure and vulnerability. Analyzing the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan with Poisson regression across 4052 neighborhoods, we factor in migration inflow (i.e., population traveling from other neighborhoods), income of the migrants' origin, and the indigenous-population percentage among migrants, along with other risk factors proven in previous studies. Our findings indicate that migration inflow significantly correlates with an increased number of fatalities. Furthermore, a lower income in the neighborhood of the migrants' origin is significantly associated with more fatalities at their destination. An elevated proportion of the indigenous population in the migrants' original neighborhood also significantly correlates with an increased number of fatalities, although the impact of the Chi-Chi earthquake does not predominantly affect indigenous jurisdictions. This study underscores the seismic-fatality risk on the outskirts of megacities, where migrants from lower-income and historically marginalized groups are more likely to reside for precarious employment, emphasizing the need for affordable and safe living infrastructure for the migrating population. Addressing migrants' vulnerabilities in housing will not only reduce seismic-fatality risk but also improve preparedness against other disasters and public health emergencies.",,,,,"Lin, Thung-Hong","Liu, Gee-Yu","Yeh, Chin-Hsun","Ceballos, Diana Maria",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Naturally, subway air pollution varies among individuals according to their mobility patterns, introducing the possibility of inequality in PM2.5 exposure. This study aims to evaluate individual and community-level exposure to subway PM2.5. We simulated the intracity home-to-work trip patterns using the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) records of 3.1 million working commuters across 34,169 census blocks in four boroughs (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx) of NYC. We incorporated the on-platform and on-train measured PM2.5 concentration data for the entire subway system. The mean underground platform concentration in the city was 139 mu g/m3 with a standard deviation of 25 mu g/m3, while the on-train concentration when underground was 99 mu g/m3 with a standard deviation of 21 mu g/m3. Using a network model, we determined the exposure of individual commuters during their daily home-work trips. We quantified the mean per capita exposure at the census block level by considering the proportion of workers within the blocks who rely on the subway for their work commute. Results indicate statistically significant weak positive correlation between elevated subway PM2.5 exposure and economically disadvantaged and racial minority groups.",,,,,"Ghandehari, Masoud",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Findings indicate a substantial increase in overall park use during the pandemic, with visiting frequencies up by 22 % and dwell time by 56 %. In contrast, minority groups, including seniors, children, blacks, unemployed, living alone, and recent movers, exhibited a decline in park visits. It also highlights visitors' risk -averse behaviors during the pandemic, such as avoiding visiting parks during holiday weeks and avoiding using swimming pools. Before the pandemic, proximity held the utmost significance for park use; during the pandemic, park quality and facilities emerged as the primary factors influencing park utilization.

Few studies have compared birds' community patterns between lockdown and ""new normal"" periods, especially in extremophile environments. This study presents the first baseline by monitoring coastal birds on 10 beaches along the largest hypersaline lagoon in South America. The birds were counted in September and October 2021 (during a lockdown period) and in October 2022 (after the lockdown - ""new normal"") during the morning. The continuous route transect methodology was applied by the same observer in all beaches. The Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was used to investigate the response of community abundance to urbanization (raster-based variable) and time of COVID-19 pandemic (lockdown vs. new normal). Rarefaction curve and Permutational Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) were used to compare community richness and composition, respectively, between lockdown and new normal periods. Generalized Linear Models (GLM) with negative binomial distribution were applied to test the effect of the same predictors on the three more abundant species. The bird community structure and composition did not change when comparing lockdown and new normal periods, mainly due to dominance of synanthropic species. Among species-specific responses to lockdown, the Southern Lapwing Vanellus chilensis was more abundant during the lockdown on six of the nine beaches where it occurred. Oppositely, the Kelp Gull Larus dominicanus and the Neotropic Cormorant Nannopterum brasilianus were more abundant in new normal period, reinforcing that these species benefit from human subsidies. This may provide a unique opportunity for science-based sustainable ecotourism activities in urban areas with synanthropic species, capitalizing activities such as birdwatching, that would certainly contribute to environmental education actions.",Seabirds,Coronavirus,Coastal lagoon,SARS-CoV-2,"Castro, italo de Braga",,,,,,Lockdown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE To ensure that users in both scholarly and applied settings understand how PLIDA can be reliably used, we assess its Combined Location Module, which provides place of residence by combining three administrative datasets since 2006. METHODS Using descriptive statistics and regression analysis, we compare the population coverage of PLIDA to the census, estimate the incidence of missing values at various spatial scales, quantify spatial mismatch between PLIDA and the census, and compare the intensity, selectivity, and spatial patterns of internal migration between the two datasets. RESULTS The PLIDA population is higher than the census population, but very remote populations and recently arrived and temporary migrants are under-represented. We uncover a high mismatch rate between PLIDA and the census for small spatial units, particularly among highly mobile groups. As a result, PLIDA overestimates the level of internal migration and slightly distorts migration age patterns at young ages. Migration patterns are broadly comparable at large spatial scales, except for rapidly growing peri-urban regions, inner cities with short-term residents, and regions with a seasonal or temporary workforce. CONCLUSION PLIDA can be used in some applied settings outside demography if the spatial scale of analysis is aggregated, the analysis is restricted to census respondents, or the analysis is limited to well-represented groups. However, in its current form PLIDA is not suitable for demographic applications such as internal migration estimates, and we discourage its use for population projections.

This assumption holds in metropolitan contexts, where central areas offer better accessibility and are associated with higher levels of PT use. In metropolitan peripheries, a large part of commuting is done on an interurban basis, so that the level of use of public transit can be linked to the supply and information available. This work aims to understand the conditions in terms of transit supply and land use, considering the most frequent trip, psychological variables, and the modal choice of commuters' motorized modes, in the intention to use the new real-time multi-modal travel app, such as advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) for digital mobility-management assistance. A Structural Equation Model is developed to empirically test a sample of 768 respondents collected in two suburban corridors in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (LMA). Finally, our findings indicate that residential location, mode choice, and trip complexity have a relevant influence on the intention to adopt travel apps. Male students belonging to Generation Y/Z are the most likely users of travel apps. Regardless of the reason, travel patterns associated with more complex (more transfers) and more frequent trips can reinforce the intention to use apps. Also, it is worth noting that students are frequent public transit users, and public transit is also related to trip complexity.",ATIS,Technophilia,Transit supply,Public transit,,,,,,,SEM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the definition, scope, methods, and applications of GEMA remain unclear and unconsolidated. To fill this research gap, we conducted a systematic review to synthesize the methodological insights, identify common research interests and applications, and furnish recommendations for future GEMA studies. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines to systematically search peer-reviewed studies from six electronic databases in 2022. Screening and eligibility were conducted following inclusion criteria. The risk of bias assessment was performed, and narrative synthesis was presented for all studies. From the initial search of 957 publications, we identified 47 articles included in the review. In public health, GEMA was utilized to measure various outcomes, such as psychological health, physical and physiological health, substance use, social behavior, and physical activity. GEMA serves multiple research purposes: 1) enabling location-based EMA sampling, 2) quantifying participants' mobility patterns, 3) deriving exposure variables, 4) describing spatial patterns of outcome variables, and 5) performing data linkage or triangulation. GEMA has advanced traditional EMA sampling strategies and enabled location-based sampling by detecting location changes and specified geofences. Furthermore, advances in mobile technology have prompted considerations of additional sensor-based data in GEMA. Our results highlight the efficacy and feasibility of GEMA in public health research.

In this study, we comprehensively investigated these two aspects by utilizing longitudinal data of the one-way EV car-sharing system in Shanghai, China, with a total count exceeding 50,000 vehicles in 2018. The results showed an unmatched coupling relationship in terms of the spatial dimension between EV car-sharing flow communities and intra-city administrative divisions. For the temporal dimension, we found that, unlike the conventional division of peak and non-peak hours, there are nine different types of car use behaviors in terms of temporal variations in EV car-sharing travel in Shanghai. We further revealed that such temporal variations, in terms of temporal attractiveness, can be significantly affected by land-use characteristics, including healthcare services, lifestyle services, companies and enterprises, and scientific, educational, and cultural services, indicating a strong and complex interaction between land use and the pattern in car use behaviors of this emerging mode of transportation.

The shape of the resulting impedance decay curves varies by several factors, but these influential factors are often dismissed in favor of just travel mode. In this study, we examine which factors should be used to distinguish impedance functions for use. Using data from a large national travel survey, we first show that the impedance curves are well approximated by functions of the exponential family and the related Tanner function. We use two methods - variable-wise function fit and Shapley additive explanations - to conclude the importance of four factors for developing impedance functions. These are travel mode, trip purpose, urbanity class of trip origin and destination, and the socioeconomic status grouping of the travelers. We then show that the use of a generalized impedance function can significantly over- or underestimate spatial accessibility compared to factor-specific impedance function, with up to 80 % overestimation on average in the case of public transit and 16 % overestimation for low socio-economic status travelers. These findings highlight the importance of the choice of impedance function which has applications in spatial economics, transportation planning, and human mobility analyses.",Distance decay,Spatial interaction,Accessibility,Travel behavior,,,,,,,Transport planning,Geography,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Traditionally, internal migration in India has been associated with factors such as backwardness, agrarian distress, and food insecurity. However, this research challenges this perspective by uncovering a growing trend of migration among the upper socio-economic strata. Contrary to popular belief, present study shows an increasing trend of migration among the educated, unmarried male youths belong to the upper strata of the socio-economic hierarchy, guided by their aspirations, accessibility, and ability of migrants rather than merely by hunger and distress. By highlighting these findings, this study urges a departure from conventional economic determinants and suggests a broader understanding of migration dynamics. It reveals that individuals from marginalized backgrounds are less likely to migrate, while migrants from higher caste-class categories possess better positions, income, and occupational status in their migration destinations. These insights contribute to a more nuanced comprehension of contemporary migration in the Hirakud Command Area. It underscores the importance of considering non-economic factors in migration analysis and calls for tailored policy interventions that address the specific needs and aspirations of different migrant groups.This study looked at why people moving out from Hirakud Command Area, a relatively agricully Prospoous region in Eastern India. According to popular understanding of migrarion, people migrate because they are poor or hungry and lack of economic oppertunities at origin. But this study found that young men who are educated and belongs to well to do families are migrating more than poor and marginalised families. They move because they want to, not because they have to. This means that we need to think differently about why people move. The study also found that poor people are less likely to move.

This study consolidates existing knowledge on e-scooter safety through a systematic literature review of 168 academic studies and grey literature, following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Our primary objective is to identify the key e-scooter safety concerns from existing literature, together with the strategies stakeholders use to address these concerns, and highlight areas for further research. The literature shows that e-scooter riders are commonly injured in single-vehicle incidents, with a clear association between severe injuries and violations of traffic rules such as speeding and alcohol consumption. Frequently recommended safety measures include separating e-scooters from pedestrians, instituting licensing and mandatory training, and enforcing helmet usage and zero alcohol consumption. On top of that, clear legislative definitions for e-scooters ease and improve enforcement, and setting technical requirements for e-scooter design can improve stability, handling performance, and reduce incidents. Understanding the differences between user types and the underlying factors influencing risky behaviour is crucial for developing effective interventions. Users of shared schemes often lack knowledge of rules and have poorer riding skills, possibly due to their less frequent use. Conversely, private e-scooter owners pose enforcement challenges for speeding and prohibited riding, as these scooters lack geofencing and tracking capabilities often found in shared scheme escooters. Helmet non-use, where mandatory, is attributed to a lack of support from riders for increased law enforcement and a low perception of risk rather than a lack of knowledge about the laws. Similarly, illegal sidewalk riding is linked to factors of comfort and convenience rather than infrastructure preference or unawareness of illegality. Proactive measures that are user-based, time-based, and location-based require further investigation. Consistently collecting and analysing data informs region-specific safety decisions and allows policymakers to monitor safety risks over time and assess intervention effectiveness, which are largely absent in current literature.",Electric scooter,E -scooter safety,Sharing schemes,Private e -scooter,,,,,,,Micro-mobility,Risky behaviour,,Safety measures,Human behaviour,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As institutions gradually return to normal in-person operations, it is critical to understand how the pandemic affected essential workers' commute and what it will take to ensure the effective recovery of transit ridership and enhance the long-term resiliency and equity of public transportation systems for those who need it the most. This study used focus group discussions with essential workers who were pre- pandemic transit riders to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted their commute perceptions, experiences, motives, and challenges and explore the potential changes in their travel behavior post-pandemic. We used NVivo 12 Pro to conduct a thematic analysis of the transcripted discussion data and examined patterns of commute mode change with respect to participants' attributes, including job type, home location, and gender. The results show that public transit had multiple reliability and frequency challenges during the pandemic, which resulted in most participants switching away from public transportation. With the increased availability of hybrid remote work and pandemic-related parking policies, driving emerged as a safer and more affordable commute mode for many pre-pandemic transit riders, rendering transit services less efficient for those who continued to rely on it. Planning for post-COVID resilient and reliable mobility requires a major rethinking of providing an efficient and effective transport system and a more fundamental approach to long-term public transport policy. To recover transit ridership, transit agencies need to ensure transit service availability and provide reliable transit information through smartphone apps.

Objective The objective of the study was to assess changes in the quantity of food and beverages purchased and proportion spent on food consumed away from home during the coronavirus disease pandemic in Mexican households. Design This study is a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data from the National Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2014-2020. Participants/setting The study included 234,631 households with information on food and beverages purchases from 2014 to 2020. Main outcome measures Food and beverage purchases were classified into six categories basic, nonbasic energy-dense foods, prepared food for consumption at home, water, milk, and sugar-sweetened beverages. In the National Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2014-2020, expenditures on food and beverages consumed away from home are not classified into any specific items but represents more than 10% of food and beverage expenditures; therefore, the analyses included the proportion of food and beverage expenditures spent on food consumed away from home. Statistical analyses performed A two-part model was used to evaluate changes in the quantity of food purchased and the proportion spent away from home during the coronavirus disease pandemic in 2020 compared with 2018, adjusting for socio-demographic variables, gross domestic product and previous survey rounds. Results are presented at the national level, by income quintile and by place of residence. Results Purchases of basic food increased by 17 g/capita/day at the national level and 22.4 g/capita/day in urban areas (P < 0.001). Purchases of nonbasic energy-dense foods decreased both at the national level (-4.2 g/capita/day; P < 0.001) and by place of residence (-4.8 g/capita/day; P < 0.001 in urban areas and -2.5 g/capita/day; P = 0.001 in rural settings). Purchases of prepared food increased 16 g/capita/day (P < 0.001). In rural areas, purchases of sugar-sweetened beverages increased 7.2 mL/per capita/day (P < 0.001).

Row_316,"Yang, Zhenyu","de Palma, Andre",Tailored priority allocation in the bottleneck model with general user heterogeneity,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL,DEC 2024,0,"We propose to enhance the efficiency of road bottlenecks by strategically implementing metering-based priority (MBP) schemes. Under MBP, a portion of the bottleneck capacity is reserved for priority users but made available for nonpriority users when no priority users are queueing. Previous studies have found that MBP is Pareto-improving regarding individual trip costs with homogeneous users, but its effectiveness becomes ambiguous when users have heterogeneous scheduling preferences. To address this, we consider a finite number of user groups with group-specified scheduling preferences. The design of optimal MBP schemes to minimize the total trip cost is formulated as a bilevel problem, allowing for varying fractions of priority users across groups. Under the identified conditions, convex optimization algorithms can be used to solve optimal MBP schemes. When these conditions are not met, we propose a general solution framework to find solutions with satisfactory accuracy. We study the theoretically optimal system efficiency achievable by MBP through numerical simulations. We also explore the benefits of integrating MBP with other travel demand management policies, such as high-occupancy vehicle lanes. Importantly, the implementation challenges of MBP schemes are also discussed, particularly the difficulty of distinguishing users based on their preferences. We investigate the efficiency of implementing optimal MBP schemes in an aggregated manner, emphasizing the significance of selecting appropriate aggregating patterns. We also propose a type of heuristic MBP scheme that ensures that nonpriority users' departures can be unaffected by MBP. Such schemes are Pareto-improving and remarkably do not require observing individual preferences. These heuristic schemes can be decentralized by assigning priority status through pricing in certain cases. Numerical results demonstrate that the heuristic approach achieves comparable efficiency levels to optimal MBP schemes in considered scenarios.",Travel demand management,Priority,Bottleneck,User heterogeneity,"Geroliminis, Nikolas",,,,,,Equilibrium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Row_317,"Yan, Xiang","He, Shenjing",Demystifying hospital size distribution: A geographical approach,APPLIED GEOGRAPHY,FEB 2024,0,"Hospital size distribution, i.e., the uneven allocation of healthcare resources between hospitals of different size classes, significantly impacts healthcare equality and efficiency and challenges healthcare governance. Yet, its variation is inadequately explained by two prevalent approaches to size distribution - the statistical approach merely works on statistical patterns, while the economic approach has difficulties in calculating hospital costreturns. This study provides an alternative - a geographical approach - to demystify hospital size distribution. Incorporating the distinctiveness of healthcare into George Stigler's (1958) classic survivor analysis of firm size distribution, we conceptualize hospital size distribution as the result of hospitals' interactions with their socioeconomic-technical environment in a defined area, and thus its pattern and variation could be understood through its coevolution with geographical contexts. We substantiate this idea with a study on China's provincial hospital size distributions between 2002 and 2019. During this period, hospitals with 0-99 beds maintained a stable proportion, while the size class of 800+ beds grew significantly, in contrast to the reduction in the size class of 100-799 beds. Cluster analysis identifies four clusters of provinces dominated by different hospital size classes after healthcare delivery reform in 2012. Cross-sectional time-series regression models find evolving impacts from market power, government intervention, and advancement of medical technology. We also offer a novel approach to understanding healthcare resource distribution by examining the structure rather than merely the number of healthcare resources.",Hospital size,Size distribution,Healthcare service,Structure of healthcare delivery,,,,,,,Healthcare reform,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immigrant transit use trends in California,TRAVEL BEHAVIOUR AND SOCIETY,JUL 2024,1,"While patronage on most public transit systems around the world remains modestly to significantly depressed post-pandemic, transit ridership had mostly been declining across the US since 2014. Advocates, practitioners, and scholars have offered a range of explanations for pre-pandemic patronage decline. This analysis examines the demand-side of this phenomenon by focusing on high-propensity transit riders, and, in particular, immigrants in the most populous US state: California. Drawing on the California add-on to the 2009 and 2017 National Household Travel Surveys, we evaluate changes in transit use among Hispanic and Asian immigrants. We find that during the study period, transit trip frequency of Hispanic immigrants declined, converging toward the ridership patterns of US-born Hispanics. While this trend was largely the result of rising incomes, increased vehicle ownership, and lower residential densities among non-US-born Hispanics, all else equal, Hispanic immigrants continued to use transit more than their US-born counterparts. By contrast, transit trip making by Asian immigrants diverged from that of US-born Asians. Notably, this divergence was not the result of declining perperson trip making by Asian immigrants, which was relatively stable during the study period. Instead, the growing gap was due to increases in transit trip frequency by US-born Asians.",Transit use,Nativity,Foreign born,Immigrants,"Taylor, Brian D.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The case of Seoul presents a unique opportunity to analyse the pandemic's impact on transit ridership, serving as a natural experiment which is characterized by the implementation of a non-lockdown policy coupled with proactive transit management strategies. This study introduces a resilience index that magnifies the ""unaveraged clues"" of changes in Origin-Destination (OD) pairs to quantify the spatially unequal response of Seoul public transit use to external shocks from 2020 to 2023. Our findings reveal spatial heterogeneity in the resilience index of OD pairs and the dynamic change of related factors. OD pairs with high resilience during the outbreak were often associated with long-distance and labour-intensive industries, highlighting the need for transit systems to cater to ""captive"" travellers during the outbreaks. Despite overall ridership recovery in Seoul, factors like car ownership and the diversity of spatial functionality continued to influence patterns, which suggests that transit systems should focus on improving attractiveness to regain lost passengers post-pandemic. These insights are valuable for aligning policy with spatial and temporal dynamics to create equitable and sustainable public transportation systems.",COVID-19,OD flow,Spatial heterogeneity,Commute behaviour,"Yoo, Chisun",,,,,,Spatial interaction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this paper is to explore the possible factors with an influence on e-scooter energy consumption. These influential factors include trip and rider attributes, built environment characteristics, road geometry, surface materials, light and meteorological conditions. This study empirically investigates factors influencing e-scooter battery energy consumption, utilizing real usage data from GPS-equipped free-floating e-scooters in four European cities at the individual trip level. GPS positions allowed for the specification of local road characteristics and ambient conditions. For this purpose Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, Open Street Maps and the Meteostat application were used. Energy consumption was explained with the use of linear regression models as a function of those parameters, while controlling user experience and battery usage intensity. An extensive dataset covering over 150,000 trips in Bordeaux, Hamburg, Malaga, and Paris and two months of observations was used to estimate the models. Results indicate that, while travel distance is the most influential factor, other usage aspects play a role. Cold weather, rain, wind, as well as stone-paved streets increase energy consumption.

In principle, improved job accessibility of a locale should lead to better employment outcomes for job seekers residing there. However, the extent to which residents of a locale can secure jobs within its isochrone by a specific mode of travel has rarely been investigated in the existing scholarship. In this article, we define ""accessible jobs"" as all the jobs within an isochrone of a locale by a specific travel mode, and ""secured jobs"" as the subset of these accessible jobs that are actually obtained by residents of the locale. Using a high-resolution location-based service data set, we calculate the secured jobs and accessible jobs of different TAZs by the 15-, 30-, and 45-min isochrones by transit or automobile in Shanghai, China. We investigate (a) the spatial patterns of the secured jobs and accessible jobs, and (b) besides the accessible jobs, what can predict the secured jobs, controlling for travel time and mode of travel. We find that the secured jobs vary across the TAZs, mode of travel, and isochrones but are often spatially autocorrelated at the TAZ level. The accessible jobs are always positively related to the secured jobs, regardless of mode of travel and travel time. This relationship is more salient for those workers by transit. The secured jobs could be predicted by a few TAZ- and isochrone-level indicators concerning land use, transport, and socioeconomic attributes. Our findings indicate that (a) accessible jobs should be considered in tandem with secured jobs, controlling for isochrones by mode of travel and travel time, and (b) both transport-land use and socioeconomic attributes at the TAZ and isochrone levels should be accounted for when planning for secured jobs and accessible jobs.",planning and analysis,transportation planning analysis and application,access/accessibility,data sources,"Zhou, Jiangping","Zhang, Tianran","Zhang, Min",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is extremely challenging to predict the demand for the first BRT service in a city of a developing country with a weak public transport system using aggregate models, given the radical difference in the level of service between the BRT and the existing modes. Further, there can be substantial changes in the activity and travel patterns in a city after the introduction of the BRT which simpler disaggregate level analysis tools are unable to predict. Agentbased simulation tools, which are the state-of-the-art tools for simulating complex travel behaviour, are hence more appropriate for predicting the network conditions after the introduction of a new BRT system. But the application of such simulation tools has been primarily limited to developed countries where the transport landscape and the travel behaviour are very different from the developing countries. To address this gap, this paper presents a demand forecasting model for BRT and integrates it into an activity-based micro-simulation tool in the context of Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh and one of the fastest growing megacities in the world. The model was developed based on an existing multi-agent, activity-based, travel demand simulator (MATSim). The MATSim implementation in the context of Dhaka focused on two aspects: (1) implementing behaviour models in MATSim to reflect the mode choice in the presence of the proposed BRT (2) integrating multiple data sources (including stated-preference data) for calibrating the mode choice and other components of MATSim to realistically mimic the travel behaviour in the city. Once calibrated, different access scenarios for BRT were simulated using MATSim, and the sensitivity of the outputs to different modelling assumptions is tested. Results from the simulation showed that the marginal utility of travel time, travel cost, and pricing structure of BRT significantly influenced BRT travel demands. Also, BRT demand was found to be the highest (25% of the total trips) in the scenario with multi-modal access/egress connections. While such direct model outputs presented in this paper will be useful for the planners to maximise the ridership of the proposed BRT, the calibrated simulator will be also useful for the evaluation of other innovative transport modes in the context of Dhaka in the future.",Bus rapid transit,Agent -based model,MATSim,Public transport,"Choudhury, Charisma F.","Hess, Stephane",,,,,Dhaka,Bangladesh,,South Asia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transmission occurs predominantly by the bite of phlebotomine sandflies, other routes, including congenital transmission, are rare. The disease manifests as either cutaneous, visceral or mucosal/mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. In recent years, changes in the epidemiological pattern have been reported from Europe.Principal findings A total of 311 new and 29 published leishmaniasis cases occurring between 01/01/2000 and 12/31/2021 in Austria were collected and analyzed. These encompassed 146 cutaneous (CL), 14 visceral (VL), 4 mucosal, and 3 cases with concurrent VL and CL. In addition, asymptomatic infections, comprising 11 unspecified cases with Leishmania DNA detectable only in the blood and 162 cases with anti-Leishmania antibodies were reported. Particularly since 2016, the incidence of leishmaniasis has steadily risen, mainly attributable to increasing numbers of CL and cases with positive serology against Leishmania species, whereas the incidence of VL has slowly decreased. Analysis revealed that a shift in the causative species spectrum had occurred and that a substantial number of CL cases were caused by members of the Leishmania donovani/infantum complex. Simultaneous occurrence of VL and CL was identified in immunocompromised individuals, but also in a not yet reported case of an immunocompetent child after vertical transmission.Conclusions The incidence of leishmaniasis has risen in the recent years. The numbers are anticipated to keep rising due to increasing human mobility, including travel and forced migration, growing reservoir host populations as well as expansion and dispersal of vector species caused by climate and habitat changes, urbanization and globalization. Hence, elevated awareness for the disease, including possible transmission in previously non-endemic regions and non-vector transmission modes, support of sandfly surveillance efforts and implementation and establishment of public health interventions in a One Health approach are pivotal in the global efforts to control and reduce leishmaniasis.Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne infectious disease caused by intracellular parasites and affects 12-15 million people worldwide. The clinical presentation is variable, and the disease mainly manifests as cutaneous, visceral or mucosal forms. We collected 340 cases of leishmaniasis occurring in Austria over a period of 21 years and performed an analysis of trends to understand the epidemiology of the disease in a non-endemic Central European country. In addition, we report a rare case of concurrent visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis which was vertically transmitted to an immunocompetent child. Our analyses revealed that the incidences of cutaneous leishmaniasis are rising in Austria and that a shift in the causative species spectrum has occurred. Due to increased population migration, travel activities of humans and animal hosts, growth and spread of the vector populations facilitated primarily by climate changes, a rising number of leishmaniasis cases can be anticipated in many endemic, but intriguingly also in non-endemic regions. The potential expansion of endemicity necessitates raising awareness towards the burden of this disease and provides an incentive to the global health community to continue their efforts in disease control.",,,,,"Egg, Maximilian","Urban, Nikolaus","Kinaciyan, Tamar","Hampel, Amelie","Fidelsberger, Luise","Karlhofer, Franz",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Porkert, Stefanie","Walochnik, Julia","Handisurya, Alessandra",,,

Seasonal retired migrants are mainly retired or semiretired people who migrate to warmer areas during the winter and then return to their original homes in the following year. Despite its increasing popularity, the evidence concerning the health status of Chinese seasonal retired migrants is controversial. Although some studies have shown that seasonal retired migrants have better health status, other studies note that migrants are driven involuntarily by health concerns and that their mental health suffers during migration. The objective of this study was to provide quantified evidence on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of seasonal retired migrants in China and to identify potential factors associated with HRQoL. Methods. This was a community-based cross-sectional study of seasonal retired migrants who lived in Wuzhishan, Hainan during the winter. The Chinese version of the EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) was used to assess participants' HRQoL. Data on demographic and behavioral characteristics, body mass index, and the presence of chronic diseases were collected using a self-administered survey. Logistic regressions were used to explore the factors associated with responses in each dimension of the EQ5D-5L descriptive system, and a multiple linear regression model was used to explore the factors associated with EuroQol visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) scores. Results. A total of 992 participants (female: 56.5%) were enrolled in the current study, with a mean age of 67.87 +/- 6.98 years. Most participants reported problems in the pain/discomfort dimension (16.7%), followed by the anxiety/depression dimension (8.3%). Few participants reported problems in the first three dimensions of the EQ5D-5L: mobility (5.4%), usual activities (2.0%), and self-care (1.2%). The median EQVAS score was 84 (interquartile range: 80-89). The regression results indicated that poor sleep quality, the presence of chronic diseases, and low-level physical activity were important factors that were negatively associated with multiple dimensions of the EQ5D-5L. In addition, the EQ-VAS score was negatively associated with age, the presence of chronic diseases, poor sleep quality, and low-level physical activity. Conclusion. This study revealed that Chinese seasonal retired migrants have high HRQoL. In addition, this study revealed that sleep quality and physical activity are correlated with multiple dimensions of the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and EQVAS. Therefore, lifestyle interventions related to sleep quality and physical activity are essential for improving HRQoL among Chinese seasonal retired migrants.",Health-related quality of life,EQ-5D,Seasonal retired migrants,Seasonal migration,"Wang, Lingjun","Wang, Shigong","Ouyang, Lin","Wang, Jiwei","Hu, Dayi","Yu, Jinming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
