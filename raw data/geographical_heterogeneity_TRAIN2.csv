Although the q statistic provides a measure of spatial stratified heterogeneity using variance differences, it is not suitable for nominal target variables and neglects information differences between strata at higher order moments. Based on the mutual information and relative entropy between variables, two spatial stratified heterogeneity measures are proposed for nominal and continuous target variables, respectively. Permutation tests are then used to determine their statistical significance. The proposed measures are suitable for either nominal or continuous target variables. They make no assumptions regarding the distribution of target variables, and return a value of zero only when the distribution of the target variable is independent of the explanatory variable. Experiments on five illustrative data sets and three publicly accessible data sets show that the proposed measures are consistent with the q statistic and can detect the existence of spatial stratified heterogeneity when the q statistic fails, so long as there are significant differences between the distributions in different strata.",mutual information,relative entropy,spatial heterogeneity,spatial stratified heterogeneity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Research on LE and its influencing factors is helpful for health improvement. Previous studies have neither considered the spatial stratified heterogeneity of LE nor explored the interactions between its influencing factors. Our study was based on the latest available LE and social and environmental factors data of 31 provinces in 2010 in China. Descriptive and spatial autocorrelation analyses were performed to explore the spatial characteristics of LE. Furthermore, the Geographical Detector (GeoDetector) technique was used to reveal the impact of social and environmental factors and their interactions on LE as well as their optimal range for the maximum LE level. The results show that there existed obvious spatial stratified heterogeneity of LE, and LE mainly presented two clustering types (high-high and low-low) with positive autocorrelation. The results of GeoDetector showed that the number of college students per 100,000 persons (NOCS) could mainly explained the spatial stratified heterogeneity of LE (Power of Determinant (PD) = 0.89, p < 0.001). With the discretization of social and environmental factors, we found that LE reached the highest level with birth rate, total dependency ratio, number of residents per household and water resource per capita at their minimum range; conversely, LE reached the highest level with consumption level, GDP per capita, number of college students per 100,000 persons, medical care expenditure and urbanization rate at their maximum range. In addition, the interaction of any two factors on LE was stronger than the effect of a single factor. Our study suggests that there existed obvious spatial stratified heterogeneity of LE in China, which could mainly be explained by NOCS.",life expectancy,spatial characteristics,social and environmental factors,spatial stratified heterogeneity,Geographical Detector,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Beginning with some basic simplifying assumptions, we derive a number of ways in which local network structure should be expected to vary across a region whose population is unevenly distributed. To examine the manner in which these effects would be expected to manifest given realistic population distributions, we then perform an exploratory simulation study that examines the features of large-scale interpersonal networks generated using block-level data from the 2000 U.S. Census. Using a stratified sample of micropolitan and metropolitan areas with populations ranging from approximately 1000 to 1,000,000 persons, we extrapolatively simulate network structure using spatial network models calibrated to two fairly proximate social relations. From this sample of simulated networks, we examine the effect of both within-location and between-location heterogeneity on a variety of structural properties. As we demonstrate, geographical variability produces large and distinctive features in the ""social fabric"" that overlies it; at the same time, however, many aggregate network properties can be fairly well-predicted from relatively simple spatial demographic variables. The impact of geographical variability is thus predicted to depend substantially on the type of network property being assessed, and on the spatial scale involved.

Taking into consideration the high frequency of beta-thalassemia as well as the occurrences of several other hemoglobinopathies, we conducted a large genotyping study to investigate the mutational background of common hemoglobinopathies in the country. Alpha- and beta-globin genes were evaluated in the carriers of mutations identified via hematological indices and hemoglobin fractions (n = 1,757). Genotyping of beta-thalassemia carriers identified through population screening revealed 32 mutations, with codon 8 [-AA]-34.96%, IVS-II-1 [G > A]-16.35%, and IVS-I-110 [G > A]-10.12% leading the spectrum. Analysis of associations of beta-thalassemia mutations with geographical regions of the country identified the strongest association between codon 8 [-AA] and Shaki-Zaqatala, and codon 5 [-CT] in Mountainous Shirvan regions (ri > 6.00; p < 0.05). HbS, HbD-Punjab, and HbE were the most prevalent among our variant hemoglobin cohort, commonly inherited in compounds with beta-thalassemia than in the homozygous state. We identified nine alpha-thalassemia mutations, 20.5 kb and 3.7 kb deletions together accounting for 74% of the spectrum. Point mutations of alpha-thalassemia were less common among our observations and were mainly inherited in compounds with deletions.

The identification of socio-geographical disparities might help to prioritize public health interventions.AimTo describe variation in the probability of teenage maternity across geopolitical departments and socio-geographical intersectional strata in Colombia.MethodsA cross-sectional study based on live birth certificates in Colombia. Teenage maternity was defined as a woman giving birth aged 19 or younger. Multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy (MAIHDA) was applied using multilevel Poisson and logistic regression. Two different approaches were used: (1) intersectional: using strata defined by the combination of health insurance, region, area of residency, and ethnicity as the second level (2) geographical: using geopolitical departments as the second level. Null, partial, and full models were obtained. General contextual effect (GCE) based on the variance partition coefficient (VPC) was considered as the measure of disparity. Proportional change in variance (PCV) was used to identify the contribution of each variable to the between-strata variation and to identify whether this variation, if any, was due to additive or interaction effects. Residuals were used to identify strata with potential higher-order interactions.ResultsThe prevalence of teenage mothers in Colombia was 18.30% (95% CI 18.20-18.40). The highest prevalence was observed in Vichada, 25.65% (95% CI: 23.71-27.78), and in the stratum containing mothers with Subsidized/Unaffiliated healthcare insurance, Mestizo, Rural area in the Caribbean region, 29.08% (95% CI 28.55-29.61). The VPC from the null model was 1.70% and 9.16% using the geographical and socio-geographical intersectional approaches, respectively. The higher PCV for the intersectional model was attributed to health insurance. Positive and negative interactions of effects were observed.ConclusionDisparities were observed between intersectional socio-geographical strata but not between geo-political departments. Our results indicate that if resources for prevention are limited, using an intersectional socio-geographical approach would be more effective than focusing on geopolitical departments especially when focusing resources on those groups which show the highest prevalence.

Linking UK Biobank data from 302,952 urban-dwelling adults in England, collected between 2006 and 2010, to publicly available Local Authority-level data, we examined (a) whether cross-sectional associations between body mass index (BMI) and two characteristics of the neighbourhood built environment (availability of formal physical activity facilities near home, and fast-food proximity) vary by Local Authority (LA), and (b) whether cross-level interactions with LA-level physical features (natural landcover) and socio-cultural attributes (local obesity norms) reveal evidence of effect modification by these features of the wider contexts in which neighbourhoods are located. We found variation across urban England in the relationship between availability of neighbourhood formal physical activity facilities and BMI, and some evidence suggesting this association was stronger among people living in areas with less natural landcover, especially in areas outside of London. We also found that the relationship between proximity of fast-food stores to people's homes and BMI varied geographically across England. Local descriptive obesity norms were not an important modifier of this association. This paper highlights the importance of considering potential geographical heterogeneity in relationships between the built environment and health, and the implications for generalisability of research findings.

Therefore, this paper evaluated the heterogeneous impacts of potential determinants on urban form, considering regional disparities and the stage of development. Based on land use data collected from Landsat ETM and TM scenes, the landscape metrics of urban size, urban centrality, urban shape irregularity, and urban fragmentation were measured to describe the urban form of 265 Chinese cities. We find that the regional disparities and development-stage variations significantly affect urban form. All urban form variables showed a significant stair-stepping difference in cities at various development stages, indicating that as a city upgrades its level of development, the intensity of urban expansion gradually increases, the shape of the urban edge becomes more fragmented and the urban built-up area becomes more compact. Urban form in Chinese cities shows significant geographical heterogeneity in terms of its driving forces. The effect of the socioeconomic factors on urban form also presented changes depending on the development stage.

We also take the Geographical and Temporal Weighted Regression (GTWR) model to explore the driving factors of spatial-temporal heterogeneity of green innovation in China. The main results are as follows. Research and development (R&D) efficiency play a dominant role for increasing regional green patent applications, while environmental regulation contributes the most to a decline of regional green patent applications during 2003-2017. Various determinants of green patent applications exhibit spatial-temporal heterogeneity, such as the coefficients of influencing factors for each province in 2017 being more significant than the same coefficients in 2003. Beijing's coefficient of R&D efficiency is the largest, while the coefficient of economic development for Shanxi is the largest.

Understanding how these factors individually and collectively affect vegetation dynamics and whether their spatial heterogeneity has any effect on vegetation greenness change is the crucial investigation area. Previous studies revealed the distinct characteristics of spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the impact factors influencing vegetation greenness change across various regions, often assuming a linear contribution mechanism between vegetation greenness change and these drivers. However, such a simplistic assumption fails to adequately capture the real-world dynamics of vegetation greenness change. Thus, this study firstly used geographical detector (Geodetector) to quantitatively measure the contribution of each factor to vegetation greenness change considering spatial heterogeneity in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) during the growing season from 2000 to 2020, then selecting significant factors from numerous drivers with the recursive feature elimination algorithm combined with a random forest model (RFE-RF), which is able to reduce redundant features in the data and prevent overfitting. Finally, four stable impact factors and the spatial heterogeneity of some factors contributing to vegetation greenness change were identified. The results show that approximately 83% of the regional vegetation has shown an overall increasing trend, while areas undergoing rapid development predominantly experienced a decline in greenness. Single factor screened by Geodetector with the explanatory power greater than 10% for vegetation greenness change included temperature (Tem), population density (PD), the land-use/land-cover (LULC), DEM, wind speed, and slope. The RFE-RF method identified precipitation (Pre) and CO2 emissions as additional influential factors for vegetation greenness change, in addition to the first four factors mentioned previously. These findings suggest that the four stable factors consistently influence vegetation greenness change. Combined with the principles of the algorithms and the above results, it was found that the spatial heterogeneity of wind speed and slope has an effect on vegetation greenness change, whereas the spatial heterogeneity of Pre and CO2 emissions has minimal effect.",vegetation greenness change,geographical detector,recursive feature elimination,impact factors,spatial heterogeneity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,stable factors,,,,,

Understanding the spatial heterogeneity of soil erosion and exploring its determinants are of great significance in preventing soil erosion and maintaining ecological sustainability in the TGRA. This study investigates the spatial heterogeneity of soil erosion and quantitatively identifies the determinants in the TGRA based on the Chinese Soil Loss Equation (CSLE) and geographical detector method. This study concluded that the soil erosion status generally improved from 1990 to 2015, showing an increasing trend from 1990 to 2000 and a decreasing trend from 2000 to 2010. Slope, land use, and vegetation coverage were the dominant individual factors affecting soil erosion in the TGRA. For the interaction factor, the combinations of land-use type and slope and vegetation coverage and slope were the key determinants, explaining 68.7% and 63.1% of the spatial heterogeneity of soil erosion in the TGRA from 1990 to 2015, respectively. Moderate and higher levels of soil erosion occurred in areas where the slope was greater than 25 degrees. Among the land-use types, dry land and bare land were prone to soil erosion. These findings reveal that land-use type and vegetation coverage should be considered for the effective prevention of soil erosion, and cultivation on sloped farmland should be prohibited, especially on slopes higher than 25 degrees in the TGRA.",soil erosion,CSLE,spatial heterogeneity,geographical detector,determinants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TGRA,,,,,

Taking advantage of cloud computing, this article aims to address the above issues and develop an open environment for geographical analysis model sharing. On the basis of the analysis of the applicability of cloud computing, the architecture of the open environment is proposed. More importantly, key strategies designed for heterogeneous model description, model encapsulating as well as model deploying and transparent accessing in the cloud are discussed in detail to establish such an environment.

The problem is important in societal applications such as flood extent mapping for disaster response and national water forecasting, but is challenging due to the noise, obstacles, and heterogeneity in feature maps, implicit spatial dependency between locations based on the contextual layer (e.g., gradient directions on a potential field), and the large number of sample locations. Existing work often assumes undirected spatial dependency, or directed dependency with a total order, and thus cannot reflect complex directed dependency with a partial order. In contrast, we recently proposed geographical hidden Markov tree, a probabilistic graphical model that generalizes the common hidden Markov model from a one-dimensional sequence to a two-dimensional map. Partial order class dependency is incorporated in the hidden class layer with a reverse tree structure. We also investigated computational algorithms for reverse tree construction, model parameter learning and class inference. This paper extends our recent model with overlaying class nodes between observation nodes and underlying hidden class nodes. The additional overlaying class layer makes the model more robust to large scale feature obstacles. We also proposed corresponding learning and inference methods. Extensive evaluations on real world datasets show that our models outperform multiple baselines in flood mapping applications, our algorithms are scalable on large data sizes, and the proposed extension enhances classification performance.",Geographical hidden Markov tree,directed class dependency,spatial prediction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These different aspects of wireless network heterogeneities offer certain benefits but also pose some challenges to effective management of radio resources. The challenges of wireless network heterogeneities are highlighted in this paper and possible solutions are proffered. The paper then compares recent network selection algorithms proposed for wireless networks with respect to the aspects of heterogeneities considered. Comparative analysis of the different network-selection algorithm shows that whereas RAT, services, and users heterogeneities have received much attention in the literature, terminal, operator, and geographical area heterogeneities have not been widely considered. Thus, more attention should be given terminal, operator, and geographical area aspects of wireless network heterogeneities so that the problems of radio resource management in wireless networks can be addressed in a more holistic way.

For healthcare access and utilization of healthcare services with partial or full support, households are recommended to be enrolled in a community-based health insurance system (CBHIS). However, many households in low-income countries incur catastrophic health expenditure. This study aimed to assess the spatial distribution and factors associated with households' enrollment level in CBHIS in Ethiopia. Methods: A cross-sectional study design with two-stage sampling techniques was used. The 2019 Ethiopian Mini Demographic and Health Survey (EMDHS) data were used. STATA 15 software and Microsoft Office Excel were used for data management. ArcMap 10.7 and SaTScan 9.5 software were used for geographically weighted regression analysis and mapping the results. A multilevel fixed-effect regression was used to assess the association of variables. A variable with a p < 0.05 was considered significant with a 95% confidence interval. Results: Nearly three out of 10 (28.6%) households were enrolled in a CBHIS. The spatial distribution of households' enrollment in the health insurance system was not random, and households in the Amhara and Tigray regions had good enrollment in community-based health insurance. A total of 126 significant clusters were detected, and households in the primary clusters were more likely to be enrolled in CBHIS.

In response, this research proposes a novel model for geographic process regionalization based on spatial time-series (STS) data. This model is designed to amalgamate adjacent entities exhibiting analogous trends in regional variable fluctuations, while segregating those with disparate trajectories. The study starts by establishing methodologies for the assessment of three distinct types of STS data similarities: value-based, shape-oriented, and periodic patterns. Following this, a tailored regionalization methodology specific to STS data is delineated. This methodology facilitates a quantitative analysis of time-series variables within each geographical region, leading to the development of a process-oriented geographic boundary model (GBM). The efficacy of this model is validated through empirical testing with synthetic data sets and further elucidated via case studies focusing on the dynamics of population and pollution levels, underscoring its substantial applicability in both human and physical geography.

The research analyzed the intensity of human impacts and the spatial variation features and dynamics of landscape patterns by introducing statistical theories and approaches. We analyzed spatio-temporal variation of landscape heterogeneity using the geostatistical techniques, such as semivariogram and Kriging interpolation. Results show that there is a higher correlation between landscape heterogeneity indexes and human impact index. Both the indexes show a moderate spatial autocorrelation as well as an obvious characteristic of anisotropy. From 1998 to 2008, the spatial differentiation of the changes in the intensity of human activities and the changes in landscape heterogeneity shows that the landscape patterns in Xiamen are closely related with the urban land utilization methods, the condition of traffic and geographical location and the physical geographical condition such as the terrain and the ecological environment.

Species richness of each UTM quadrat was estimated by compiling a large database (more than a million records) from bibliographic references and atlases. Mean environmental conditions of each quadrat were derived from climatic maps. Environmental heterogeneity was estimated from the diversity of geological substrates and climatic classes in each quadrat. The increase in effective (real) area due to topographic complexity was also considered (derived from the digital elevation model). The statistical analysis was performed by a weighted analysis of deviance assuming a negative binomial error distribution. The results suggest that species richness in the study area is a function of both within-quadrat heterogeneity (specifically, effective area, heterogeneity of geological substrates, heterogeneity of January temperature) and mean environmental conditions (mean annual temperature, Thornthwaite moisture index and aspect). All these parameters showed a positive relationship with species richness. Quadrat heterogeneity accounted for ca. 2/3 of the explained deviance. suggesting the importance of environmental heterogeneity when using a geographical grid system.

However, the nonlinear constraints of spatial heterogeneity on the model ensemble process make it difficult to adaptively determine the ensemble weights, greatly limiting the predictive ability of the ensemble learning model. This paper therefore proposes a novel geographical spatial heterogeneous ensemble learning method (GSH-EL). Firstly, the geographically weighted regression model, geographically optimal similarity model, and random forest model are used as three base learners to express local spatial heterogeneity, global feature correlation, and nonlinear relationship of geographic elements, respectively. Then, a spatially weighted ensemble neural network module (SWENN) of GSH-EL is proposed to express spatial heterogeneity by exploring the complex nonlinear relationship between the spatial proximity and ensemble weights. Finally, the outputs of the three base learners are combined with the spatial heterogeneous ensemble weights from SWENN to obtain the spatial prediction results. The proposed method is validated on the PM2.5 air quality and landslide dataset in China, both of which obtain more accurate prediction results than the existing ensemble learning strategies.

These heterogeneities may lead to unexpected results among clinical trials.Area covered: In this review, we address the heterogeneity noted in early phase HCC trials, trials involving transarterial chemoembolization, and advanced HCC trials. Furthermore, we discuss possible methods to attenuate the detrimental effects of heterogeneity when conducting clinical trials.Expert opinion: Clinical trials in HCC exhibit an inherently high degree of heterogeneity because of various reasons: tumor heterogeneity, different cirrhotic backgrounds, various etiologies of cirrhosis, and geographical differences in practice and expertise. Such heterogeneity may cause imbalance among the enrolled patient population, premature withdrawal from the clinical trial, and variable response to the treatment. In addition, methodological heterogeneity also exists in designing trial protocol and response evaluation. All these factors may eventually lead to conflicting results among clinical trials. Accounting for these heterogeneities is important to foster the success of future trials. In recent years, significant progress with molecular targeted agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors was made in advanced HCC.

However, there are few studies on the spatiotemporal distribution and driving factors of carbon emissions. This paper takes the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) urban agglomeration as the research object and analyzes the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of carbon dioxide emissions and their driving factors from 2000 to 2017. First, a series of preprocessing, such as resample, interpolation, and image clipping, are conducted on the CO2 emission data and nighttime light remote sensing images. Second, the dynamic time wrapping (DTW) and hierarchical clustering algorithms were involved in manipulating the CO2 emission data. Consequently, the cities' and CO2 emissions' time series were classified into four categories and three stages separately. Finally, the geographical detector model (GDM) and geographical and temporal weighted regression (GTWR) are coupled to evaluate the spatiotemporal heterogeneity and quantify the driving factors. The results show the following: (1) The spatiotemporal distribution of CO2 emissions has spatial consistency from 2000 to 2017. High-emission areas are concentrated in economically developed areas such as Shanghai, Suzhou, and Wuxi. The results are consistent with previous research. (2) Regional aggregation is a revealed new trend. CO2 emissions in the target urban areas are gradually converging into economic center cities and diverse class cities, e.g., Shanghai and Ningbo. (3) In cities of different economic development levels, the driving factors of CO2 emissions are different. The secondary sector and urban infrastructure dominate in the early stages of developed cities. On top of that, the influence of the tertiary industry is more significant in the later development stages. According to the results, in the urban development process, humans should not only pursue the increase in speed but also pay attention to the negative impact of the economic development process on the ecological environment. Besides, since the spatiotemporal characteristics and dominant factors of urban carbon emissions are different in each stage of development, the formulation of carbon reduction policies should be associated with urban features.",CO2 emissions,spatiotemporal heterogeneity,dynamic time wrapping,geographical detector,geographical and temporal weighted regression,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further analysis identifies that the supply chain risks, which drive strategies for firms to utilise a geographically proximate supplier distribution, stem from various sources.

The aim of this study was, using routine Trichinella test data in pig and game animals, to investigate the extent of Trichinella infection in slaughtered animals in Romania, over the period of 1997-2004, and to identify possible differences in prevalence among the various regions of Romania. Trichinella infection data were obtained from trichinelloscopic examinations of domestic (backyard and industrial reared pigs) and game species (wild boar and bears). A marked difference between Transylvania and other counties of Romania, observed for human trichinellosis, was taken into account when analyzing Trichinella epidemiological data. A cumulative prevalence of 8 cases/10(4) animals tested for pigs, 9 cases/10(3) animals tested for wild boars, and 13.1 cases/10(2) animals tested for bears was obtained for the 8 years period. Analysis of animal prevalence data demonstrated a geographical heterogeneity: whereas Trichinella prevalence in pigs is much lower in Transylvania than in the other counties, Trichinella prevalence in game animals is similar for the different regions. This observation suggests that, in Romania, rather than the levels of the parasite circulating in domestic and game animals, it was changes in the social and political structure of Romania in the 1990s, combined with inadequate meat inspection practices that were the main contributors to these geographic variations.

Whether geographical indication certification can promote the technical complexity of export agricultural products in the process of high-quality agricultural transformation in developing countries is a new issue that has to be studied urgently. Therefore, based on the provincial panel data from 2005 to 2019, this research examines the impact of geographical indication certification on the technical complexity of China's export agricultural products. The empirical results reveal that geographic indication certification can significantly improve the technical complexity of export agricultural products. Moreover, the positive spillover effect of geographical indications on the export of agricultural products is strengthened as the level of the technical complexity of products increases. However, the regression coefficient at the 85% quantile decreases, reflecting that the current international recognition of geographical indication certification in China needs improvement. The heterogeneity study finds that the above results are not significantly supported by evidence in the central region. Thus, the quality guidance role of geographical indication products in the central region has not been brought into full play, thereby restraining the price addition ability of export agricultural products.

However, the currently used prediction models fail to capture the focal nature of its transmission due to the macro-geographical levels considered and paucity of data at local levels. This study determined the spatial distribution of Schistosoma haematobium and related risk factors in Ndumo area, uMkhanyakude District, KwaZulu-Natal province in South Africa. A sample of 435 schoolchildren between 10 to 15 years old from 10 primary schools was screened for S. haematobium using the filtration method. Getis-Ord Gi* and Bernoulli model were used to determine the hotspots of S. haematobium infection intensity based on their spatial distribution. Semiparametric-Geographically Weighted Regression (s-GWR) model was used to predict and analyse the spatial distribution of S. haematobium in relation to environmental and socio-economic factors. We confirmed that schistosomiasis transmission is focal in nature as indicated by significant S. haematobium cases and infection intensity clusters (p < 0.05) in the study area. The s-GWR model performance was low (R-2=0.45) and its residuals did not show autocorrelation (Moran's I=-0.001; z-score=0.003 and p-value=0.997) indicating that the model was correctly spelled. The s-GWR model also indicated that the coefficients for some of the socio-economic variables such as distances of households from operational piped water collection points, distance from open water sources, religion, toilet use, household head and places of bath and laundry significantly (t-values +/-1.96) varied across the landscape thereby determining the variation of S. haematobium infection intensity. This evidence may be used for control and management of the disease at micro scale. However, there is need for further research into more factors that may improve the performance of the s-GWR models in determining the local variation of S. haematobium infection intensity.

It can be summarized as spatial stratified heterogeneity (SSH), which is measured and attributed using the geographical detector (Geodetector) q-statistic. SSH is typically calibrated by stratification and hundreds of algorithms have been developed. Little is discussed about the conditions of the methods. In this work, a novel stratification method based on head/tail breaks is introduced for the purpose of better capturing the SSH of geographical variables with a heavy-tailed distribution. Compared to conventional sample-based stratifications, the presented approach is a population-based optimized stratification that indicates an underlying scaling property in geographical spaces. It requires no prior knowledge or auxiliary variables and supports a naturally determined number of strata instead of being subjectively preset. In addition, our approach reveals the inherent hierarchical structure of geographical variables, characterizes its dominant components across all scales, and provides the potential to make the stratification meaningful and interpretable. The advantages were illustrated by several case studies in natural and social sciences. The proposed approach is versatile and flexible so that it can be applied for the stratification of both geographical and nongeographical variables and is conducive to advancing SSH-related studies as well.

Here, we constructed a new area-based health coverage index using the geographical information and a variable selection procedure with the example of gastric cancer. We also characterized the geographical distribution of health inequality in Japan. To construct the index, we proposed a methodology of a geographically weighted logistic lasso model.

Meanwhile, the spatial distribution of China's energy consumption and economic development exhibits a significant imbalance, complicating efforts to achieve Pareto optimization of regional energy allocation efficiency. Addressing this issue, this study explores the heterogeneity of the factors influencing energy consumption in China from the dual perspectives of economic ""new normal"" and geographic space, using an exponential decomposition model. The results of the study show that: (1) the inhibitory effect of the energy intensity effect on the growth of regional energy consumption is differentiated, with stronger inhibitory effects in Guangdong, Jiangsu and other provinces, and weaker inhibitory effects in Hainan, Qinghai, and other provinces. Living standard effect on the regional energy consumption growth of the promotion of the effect also has differences, Jiangsu, Shandong and other provinces of the promotion of the effect is stronger, while Hainan, Qinghai, and other provinces of the promotion of the effect is weaker. (2) Population size effect on regional energy consumption growth is not consistent in the direction of the role of Guangdong, Zhejiang, and other provinces have a promotional effect and the role of the effect of the stronger, on the contrary, the provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Gansu has an inhibitory effect. (3) In the late stage of the economic ""new normal"", the effects of energy intensity effect, living standard effect and population size effect on the growth of energy consumption in the four regions show a weakening trend, and this weakening trend is more obvious in the northeast region. This study expands theoretical research on factors affecting energy consumption and offers practical guidance for China's government to coordinate regional energy allocation under the economic ""new normal"" and geographical considerations.","economic ""new normal""",energy consumption,geographical space,heterogeneity analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used species-area analysis and analysis of covariance to investigate geographical (cast vs. west) and topographic (lowland vs. montane) patterns of diversity. We used community diversity as a surrogate for biological heterogeneity, and the diversity of naturally rare species in quarter degree squares as an indicator of differences in speciation/extinction histories across the study region. We then used standard statistical methods to analyse geographical and topographic patterns of these two measures. There was a clear geographical diversity pattern (richer in the west), while a topographic pattern (richer in mountains) was evident only in the west. The geographical boundary coincided with a transition from the reliable winter-rainfall zone (west) to the less reliable non-seasonal rainfall zone (cast). Community diversity, or biological heterogeneity, showed no significant variation in relation to geography and topography. Diversity patterns of rare species mirrored the diversity pattern for all species. We hypothesize that regional diversity patterns are the product of different speciation and extinction histories, leading to different steady-state diversities. Greater Pleistocene climatic stability in the west would have resulted in higher rates of speciation and lower rates of extinction than in the east, where for the most, Pleistocene climates would not have favoured Cape lineages. A more parsimonious hypothesis is that the more predictable seasonal rainfall of the west would have favoured non-sprouting plants and that this, in turn, resulted in higher speciation and lower extinction rates. Both hypotheses are consistent with the higher incidence of rare species in the west, and higher levels of beta and gamma diversity there, associated with the turnover of species along environmental and geographical gradients, respectively. These rare species do not contribute to community patterns; hence, biological heterogeneity is uniform across the region. The weak topography pattern of diversity in the west arises from higher speciation rates and lower extinction rates in the topographically complex mountains, rather than from the influence of environmental heterogeneity on diversity.",extinction,heterogeneity,plant diversity,speciation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Temporal variation in relative abundance was assessed from monthly collections over 4 years at one locality. Effects of weather variables over the 28 days before each collection were examined. A generalized linear model of the spatial data showed significant geographical variation in relative abundance, and significant climatic effects, with the proportion of D. aldrichi higher in the warm season, and increasing as temperature variation decreased and moisture indices increased. The temporal data gave generally concordant results, as D. aldrichi proportion was higher in summer and autumn, and increased as maximum and minimum temperatures increased, and as variation in maximum temperature decreased. In a laboratory competition experiment, D. aldrichi eliminated D. buzzatii at 31 degrees C, but was itself eliminated at 18 degrees C and 25 degrees C.

Accurately characterizing the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of WCF and further exploring its driving factors are of great significance for river basin management. Here, the WCF of the upper Yangtze River basin (UYRB) from 1991 to 2020 was calculated using the water yield module in the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Service and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model. Also, we innovatively applied emerging hot spot analysis (EHSA), which could describe the location and pattern of historical changes more accurately, to investigate the spatiotemporal heterogeneity and evolution of WCF. Based on the Geographical Detector Model (GDM), the main driving factors of WCF and their interactions were revealed. The results showed the following: (1) the WCF in the UYRB experienced a temporal increase at a growth rate of 1.48 mm/a, while remarkable differences were observed across the change rates of sub-watersheds. (2) The spatial variation of the WCF showed a gradual increase from northwest to southeast. Interestingly, the Jinshajing River upstream (JSJU) source area with a low WCF showed an increasing trend (with diminishing cold spots). On the contrary, the downstream regions of the JSJU watershed (with intensifying cold spots) underwent a weakening WCF. (3) Among all driving factors, precipitation (q = 0.701) exhibited the most remarkable prominent impact on the spatial heterogeneity of the WCF. Additionally, the interaction of factors exhibited more explanatory power than each factor alone, such as precipitation and saturated soil hydraulic conductivity (q = 0.840).

First, spatial search distance was automatically determined by the spatial distance among soil samples. Second, similarities of adjacent soil samples and the local spatial variation level were comprehensively considered to calculate outlier scores. Finally, a frequency histogram of outlier scores was generated to determine a suitable threshold for recognizing potential abnormal samples. To validate the proposed method, it was compared to Lambda and Box-Plot methods, and the ordinary kriging method was used to map five soil properties, including pH, soil organic matter, total nitrogen, available phosphorus and available potassium, in an agricultural region. Then, a synthetic study using artificially contaminated DEM data was also conducted. The comparative experiment shows that the proposed method is better able to recognize potential outliers by mining the local spatial structure, as indicated by lower mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) values.

An assessment of predictors of spatial variations of TB at community level could fill the knowledge gaps, and helps in devising tailored interventions to improve TB control. Objective To assess the pattern of spatial distribution of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) based on geographic locations of individual cases in the Dale district and Yirga Alem town in southern Ethiopia. Methods The socio-demographic characteristics of PTB cases were collected using a structured questionnaire, and spatial information was collected using geographic position systems. We carried out Getis and Ord (Gi*) statistics and scan statistics to explore the pattern of spatial clusters of PTB cases, and geographically weighted regression (GWR) was used to assess the spatial heterogeneities in relationship between predictor variables and PTB case notification rates (CNRs). Results The distribution of PTB varied by enumeration areas within the kebeles, and we identified areas with significant hotspots in various areas ineach year. In GWR analysis, the disease distribution showed a geographic heterogeneity (non-stationarity) in relation to physical access (distance to TB control facilities) and population density (AICc = 5591, R-2 = 0.3359, adjusted R-2 = 0.2671). The model explained 27% of the variability in PTB CNRs (local R-2 ranged from 0.0002-0.4248 between enumeration areas). The GWR analysis showed that areas with high PTB CNRs had better physical accessibility to TB control facilities and high population density. The effect of physical access on PTB CNRs changed after the coverage of TB control facilities was improved. Conclusion We report a varying distribution of PTB in small and different areas over 10 years.

Meanwhile, as top three consumers of primary energy of the world, China, the United States of America, and India burn over 45% of global fuels in 2016. Conducting an empirically comparative analysis of them can also set up pilot scheme for other economies to develop more efficient strategies for energy consumption. The paper modified the original Geographical Detector model with a different sampling method to detect the key driver of energy consumption growth rate, which filling the gap that there are possible interactions of potential factors. The results show that coal intensity is the biggest driver to change overall energy consumption growth rate in China and India. In comparison, for the United States, the leading drivers of energy use are the factors of individual incomes and oil intensity. In addition, all factors have interactions and enhance each other when influencing total energy consumption growth rate. India has the strongest factor interactions when influencing the energy consumption growth rate among the three economies, all interactions between factors in US is not significant as those in China and India.

Species exist in two spaces that are linked in the so-called Hutchinsonian Duality: distributions in geographical space and ecological niches in environmental space. We explore implications of using distinct methods to select locations for biodiversity inventories, based on this idea of two-space distributions. We combined empirical and statistical methods to facilitate selecting localities for biodiversity inventory based on either or both of geographical and environmental considerations. These approaches were applied to select sites for inventory in four example countries. For one of our examples, we tested how effective distinct methods were in sampling biodiversity. Random and geographically uniform selections are generally biased towards the most common environments in the regions; selections aiming for uniform sampling of environments are concentrated spatially in areas of high heterogeneity in geographical context. Considering disparate geographical distributions of environments helped to cover geographical areas more broadly when selections were environmentally uniform. Generally, sets of sites selected considering environmental conditions perform better in sampling known biodiversity in regions of interest. Our results underline the benefits of considering environmental and geographical conditions when selecting sites on the effectiveness of resulting inventories.

However, there is a lack of quantitative comparative study on disaggregated renewable power sources concerning their generation efficiency performance, regional heterogeneity, development potential, and influencing mechanism in the existing literature. In the case of China's 30 provinces, this paper evaluates the hydropower, solar power, and wind power generation efficiency by stochastic frontier analysis method, and then reveals the distribution characteristics and deployment potential of different renewable sources. Furthermore, from the perspective of spatial heterogeneity, geographical detector model is utilized to study the influence mechanism of the generation efficiency of different renewable sources. The main results are as follows. Firstly, production inefficiency prevails in hydropower, solar power, and wind power generation industries. The installed capacity, utilized hours, and auxiliary power consumption have positive impacts on the three renewable energy sources. Every 1% increase in auxiliary power consumption leads to 0.16% increase in solar power generation, which is quite larger than the increase in hydropower and wind power. Secondly, on average, hydropower has the highest level of generation efficiency, followed by wind power and solar power. Kernel density curves indicate the generation efficiency of hydropower, solar power, and wind power displays distinct aggregation characteristics. Different energy types show significant regional differences in deployment potential. Thirdly, annual precipitation accounts for 76% of the spatial heterogeneity in hydropower generation efficiency, followed by hydropower technology innovation and power structure. As for solar power generation efficiency, the most important influencing factors are electricity investment and economic development. By contrast, wind power generation efficiency is primarily affected by power structure, electricity investment, and urbanization. Additionally, there exist distinct synergistic effects among different variables. These results provide insightful policy support for the improvement of renewable power generation efficiency.

ResultsHabitat and topographic heterogeneity are weakly correlated across Africa (rho = 0.14). Habitat heterogeneity is inversely related to range size (model coefficient = -0.88). Incorporating habitat heterogeneity significantly decreased the model's AICc, increased its likelihood and increased the proportion of variance that is explained in the range sizes of species. Conversely, topographic heterogeneity is not significantly related to range size and had no impact on the model's AICc, likelihood or predictive performance. This contrast between habitat and topographic heterogeneity is particularly prevalent in carnivorous mammalian clades. Results at multiple spatial resolutions differed minimally. Main ConclusionsOur findings advance ecological theory by demonstrating that a landscape's variation in habitats, and not in elevations, relates inversely with mammalian range size and therefore facilitates the coexistence of small-ranged mammals. Conservation efforts in regions of high habitat heterogeneity will be critical to prevent extinctions in Africa's biodiverse mammalian species.",Africa,habitat heterogeneity,macroecology,mammalogy,phylogenetic generalized least squares regression,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,range size,,topographic heterogeneity,,,

Further analyses of the spatiotemporal and demographic changes occurring in the last decade and its implication on estimates of disease burden are required to inform intervention strategies. In this study, we quantified the epidemiological shift and geographical heterogeneity in the burden of leptospirosis during 2005-2015 in China.MethodsWe used reported leptospirosis case data from 1st January 2005 to 31st of December 2015 that routinely collected by the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention (CISDCP) to analyze the epidemiological trend and estimate the burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) over space, time, and demographical groups.ResultsA total of 7763 cases were reported during 2005-2015. Of which, 2403 (31%) cases were the laboratory-confirmed case. Since 2005, the notified incidence rate was gradually decreased (P<0.05) and it was relatively stable during 2011-2015 (P>0.05). During 2005-2015, we estimated a total of 10313 DALYs were lost due to leptospirosis comprising a total of 1804 years-lived with disability (YLDs) and 8509 years-life lost (YLLs). Males had the highest burden of disease (7149 DALYs) compared to females (3164 DALYs). The highest burden estimate was attributed to younger individuals aged 10-19 years who lived in southern provinces of China. During 2005-2015, this age group contributed to approximately 3078 DALYs corresponding to 30% of the total DALYs lost in China. Yet, our analysis indicated a declining trend in burden estimates (P<0.001) since 2005 and remained relatively low during 2011-2015. Low burden estimates have been identified in the endemic regions where infections principally distributed. Most of the changes in DALY estimates were driven by changes in YLLs.ConclusionsIn the last 11-years, the burden estimates of leptospirosis have shown a declining trend across the country; however, leptospirosis should not be neglected as it remains an important zoonotic disease and potentially affecting the young and productive population in economically less-developed provinces in southern of China. In addition, while in the last five years the incidence has been reported at very low-level, this might not reflect the true incidence of leptospirosis. Strengthened surveillance in the endemic regions is, hence, substantially required to capture the actual prevalence to better control leptospirosis in China.",Leptospirosis,Epidemiology,Burden,China,DALY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Spatiotemporal trends,,,,,

One important use of RCTs is to study the causes of global poverty-a subject explicitly cited in the 2019 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel awarded to Duflo, Banerjee, and Kremer ""for their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty."" Because the ATE is a population summary, researchers often want to better understand how the treatment effect varies across different populations by conditioning on tabular variables such as age and ethnicity that were measured during the RCT data collection. Although such variables carry substantive importance, they are often only observed only near the time of the experiment: exclusive use of such variables may fail to capture historical, geographical, or neighborhood-specific contributors to effect variation. In global poverty research, when the geographical location of the experiment units is approximately known, satellite imagery can provide a window into such historical and geographical factors important for understanding heterogeneity. However, there is no causal inference method that specifically enables applied researchers to analyze Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATEs) from images. In this paper, we develop a deep probabilistic modeling framework that identifies clusters of images with similar treatment effect distributions, enabling researchers to analyze treatment effect variation by image. Our interpretable image CATE model also emphasizes an image sensitivity factor that quantifies the importance of image segments in contributing to the mean effect cluster prediction. We compare the proposed methods against alternatives in simulation; additionally, we show how the model works in an actual RCT, estimating the effects of an anti-poverty intervention in northern Uganda and obtaining a posterior predictive distribution over treatment effects for the rest of the country where no experimental data was collected.

Consequently, the conventional entomological methods have become insufficiently sensitive and probably underestimate micro-geographical heterogeneity of exposure and subsequent risk of malaria transmission. In this study, we investigated whether the human antibody (Ab) response to Anopheles salivary gSG6-P1 peptide, known as a biomarker of Anopheles exposure, could be a sensitive and reliable tool for discriminating human exposure to Anopheles bites in area of low and seasonal malaria transmission.Methods: A multi-disciplinary survey was performed in Northern Senegal where An. gambiae s.l. is the main malaria vector. Human IgG Ab response to gSG6-P1 salivary peptide was compared according to the season and villages in children from five villages in the middle Senegal River valley, known as a low malaria transmission area.Results: IgG levels to gSG6-P1 varied considerably according to the villages, discriminating the heterogeneity of Anopheles exposure between villages. Significant increase of IgG levels to gSG6-P1 was observed during the peak of exposure to Anopheles bites, and decreased immediately after the end of the exposure season. In addition, differences in the season-dependent specific IgG levels between villages were observed after the implementation of Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets by The National Malaria Control Program in this area.Conclusion: The gSG6-P1 salivary peptide seems to be a reliable tool to discriminate the micro-geographical heterogeneity of human exposure to Anopheles bites in areas of very low and seasonal malaria transmission.

However, there is no universal method for determining regional HDRs that considers various environmental variables and biodiversity in different regions. This study selected 32 nature reserves as natural areas in Yunnan, China, to examine regional HDRs in Yunnan. We calculated 17 EH parameters (of soil, topography, and climate) and three (ecosystem, plant, and animal) biodiversity indices in the nature reserves. By examining the explanatory power of each EH parameter and area of the nature reserve, we identified the primary parameters and constructed an optimal model for each biodiversity index. The explanatory powers of these parameters varied for each biodiversity index, and those of climatic parameters were generally higher than soil and topographic heterogeneity ones. Heterogeneity of the temperature annual range, followed by area and heterogeneity of soil type, were important parameters for ecosystem diversity of Yunnan and the optimal model explained 56.9%. Plant diversity was explained 54.5% by its optimal model, consisting of heterogeneity of precipitation of the coldest quarter and annual precipitation. Heterogeneity of temperature annual range was important for animal diversity in Yunnan and explained 29.6% of its optimal model.

From this scope, we present a novel geographical implementation of RF, named Geographical Random Forest (GRF) as both a predictive and exploratory tool to model population as a function of RS covariates. GRF is a disaggregation of RF into geographical space in the form of local sub-models. From the first empirical results, we conclude that GRF can be more predictive when an appropriate spatial scale is selected to model the data, with reduced residual autocorrelation and lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values. Finally, and of equal importance, GRF can be used as an effective exploratory tool to visualize the relationship between dependent and independent variables, highlighting interesting local variations and allowing for a better understanding of the processes that may be causing the observed spatial heterogeneity.",Random forest,spatial analysis,population estimation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used township-level nationwide data for the years 2015 to 2019, including age-standardized premature mortality rates and three upstream SDOH (ethnicity, education, and income). Space-time scan statistics were used to assess the geographical inequality in premature mortality. A geographical and temporal weighted regression was applied to assess spatial heterogeneity and how neighbourhood SDOH contribute to geographic variation in premature mortality. We found geographical inequality in premature mortality to be clearly clustered around mountainous rural and indigenous areas. The association between neighbourhood SDOH and premature mortality was shown to be area-specific. Ethnicity and education could explain nearly 84% variation in premature mortality. After adjusting for neighbourhood SDOH, only a handful of hotspots for premature mortality remained, mainly consisting of rural and indigenous areas in the central-south region of Taiwan.

Accurately learning the driving factors of insect decline is difficult because of the complex multitrophic and environmental interactions involved. The scientific interpretation of the factors driving insect distribution is essential to understanding biological systems and the effects of changed environment. Generally, insect distributions result from the interactions of different factors, therefore, understanding how multi-factor interactions effect of carabid distribution is beneficial. Carabid beetles are indicator species in the steppes of northwestern China. Previous studies have focused on the main driving factors of carabid beetle occurrence separately, ignoring the interactions between drivers. Using the Geographical Detector method, a new method of spatial statistics, the interactive influences of 15 variables on carabid beetle distribution were quantified at three steppes in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous region, of northwestern China. The results showed that carabid beetle distribution in the steppes was primarily driven by annual average precipitation (q = 0.55). Among the interactions of factors, precipitation boolean AND Altitude (q = 0.719) was the strongest, followed by precipitation boolean AND plant biomass (q = 0.677 ), and precipitation boolean AND pH value (q = 0.677). The areas with the greatest risk of carabid beetle decline are the desert steppe and northern parts of the meadow steppe. This study shows that the Geographical Detector approach was successful for analyzing the driving forces of carabid beetle distribution.

Recent studies have proposed that genetic and epigenetic variation could both contribute to ecological adaptation, yet it remains unclear on the interplay between these two components underpinning rapid adaptation in wild animal populations. To assess their respective contributions to local adaptation, we explored epigenomic and genomic responses to environmental heterogeneity in eight recently colonized ascidian (Ciona intestinalis) populations at a relatively fine geographical scale. Based on MethylRADseq data, we detected strong patterns of local environment-driven DNA methylation divergence among populations, significant epigenetic isolation by environment (IBE), and a large number of local environment-associated epigenetic loci. Meanwhile, multiple genetic analyses based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showed genomic footprints of divergent selection. In addition, for five genetically similar populations, we detected significant methylation divergence and local environment-driven methylation patterns, indicating the strong effects of local environments on epigenetic variation. From a functional perspective, a majority of functional genes, Gene Ontology (GO) terms, and biological pathways were largely specific to one of these two types of variation, suggesting partial independence between epigenetic and genetic adaptation. The methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) analysis showed that the genetic variation explained only 18.67% of methylation variation, further confirming the autonomous relationship between these two types of variation. Altogether, we highlight the complementary interplay of genetic and epigenetic variation involved in local adaptation, which may jointly promote populations' rapid adaptive capacity and successful invasions in different environments. The findings here provide valuable insights into interactions between invaders and local environments to allow invasive species to rapidly spread, thus contributing to better prediction of invasion success and development of management strategies.",epigenetic variation,genetic variation,independent relationship,invasive species,local adaptation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,tunicate,,,,,

We retrieved 124 estimates of average preferred family size from 94 publications (from the year 2001 and onwards) in the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database (CNKI) and used mixed-effect meta-regression model to investigate heterogeneity.

The averaged preferred family size varies by different characteristics and measurement. This study also points out whether particular groups have higher or lower preferences.

However, local labor and rental markets and other local environmental differences are likely to generate heterogeneity in such relationships, at least to some extent. The purpose of this paper is to argue that useful if only indirect and suggestive evidence on the extent of area heterogeneity is readily available in virtually any census. Such indirect evidence is provided by non-monetary indicators-such as literacy, asset ownership or access to sanitation-which are routinely included in censuses. These indicators can be used to perform validation exercises to gauge the extent of heterogeneity in their distribution conditional on predictors analogous to those commonly used in poverty mapping. We argue that the same factors which are likely to generate area heterogeneity in poverty mapping are also likely to generate heterogeneity in such kind of validation exercises. We construct a very simple model to illustrate this point formally. Finally, we evaluate empirically the argument using data from Mexico. In our empirical illustrations, the performance of imputation methodologies to construct maps of indicators typically feasible with census data alone is indeed informative about how effectively such methodologies can produce correct inference in poverty mapping.

Existing rental house price models based on either the geographically weighted regression (GWR) or deep-learning methods can hardly predict very satisfactory prices, since the rental house prices involve both complicated nonlinear characteristics and spatial heterogeneity. The linear-based GWR model cannot characterize the nonlinear complexity of rental house prices, while existing deep-learning methods cannot explicitly model the spatial heterogeneity. This paper proposes a fully connected neural network-geographically weighted regression (FCNN-GWR) model that combines deep learning with GWR and can handle both of the problems above. In addition, when calculating the geographical location of a house, we propose a set of locational and neighborhood variables based on the quantities of nearby points of interests (POIs). Compared with traditional locational and neighborhood variables, the proposed ""quantity-based"" locational and neighborhood variables can cover more geographic objects and reflect the locational characteristics of a house from a comprehensive geographical perspective. Taking four major Chinese cities (Wuhan, Nanjing, Beijing, and Xi'an) as study areas, we compare the proposed method with other commonly used methods, and this paper presents a more precise estimation model for rental house prices.

The existing studies, however, fail to examine the spatially varying relationships between landslide susceptibility and its explanatory factors. This paper investigates the spatial variation in such relationships in Liangshan, China, leveraging a spatially explicit model, namely, geographical random forest (GRF). By comparing with random forest (RF), we found that GRF achieves a higher performance with an AUC of 0.86 due to its consideration of the spatial heterogeneity among variables. GRF also provides a higher-quality landslide susceptibility map than RF by correctly placing 92.35% of the landslide points in high-susceptibility areas. The local feature importance derived from GRF allows us to understand that the impact of conditioning factors varies across space, which can provide implications for policy development by local governments to place different levels of attention on different conditioning factors in specific counties to prevent and mitigate landslides. To account for the spatial dependence among the data in the model performance assessment, we use spatial cross-validation (CV) to split the data into subsets spatially rather than randomly for model training and testing.

The feature extraction method is data-driven, unbiased, and builds on the commonly used data reduction technique of Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis (ISODATA) clustering with the support of divergence separability indices. First, the relevant spatial-temporal variation in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is classified through ISODATA clustering. Second, a series of prepared cluster maps are overlaid to examine and detect the frequency with which boundaries between clusters occur at the same location. This step identifies the boundary strength between clusters and detects spatial heterogeneity within them. Results of the method are explored for the typical agriculture-defined landscape of the Mekong delta, Vietnam, using NDVI-imagery time-series from SPOT-Vegetation and MODIS-Terra.

The case of agri-food geographical indications in the Veneto Region,LAND USE POLICY,DEC 2022,8,"Geographical indications (GIs) represent a quality label attributed to those agri-food products whose quality reputation is grounded on a given 'terroir' (i.e., its area of production). Climate change can alter terroir features. While several studies already addressed the effects of climate change on wine terroirs, little attention has been paid to agri-food GIs so far. Taking Veneto Region (Italy) as a case study and based on the Disaster Risk Reduction framework, this work aims to highlight the territorial hotspots of agri-food GIs exposure to climate disaster risk. The adopted approach combines two strategies: first, a cluster analysis on municipality level data (covering physical, social and production characteristics) is performed; second, the returned clusters are analysed under the light of climate change hazards, adopting nonparametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests) to pinpoint significant differences. The study elucidates region heterogeneity in terms of GI systems and the ter-ritories where they couple with local-level climate change hazards. Thus, a need for a greater focus on these territorial hotspots is required within climate adaptation policies. Also more-tailored measures, which consider both specific characteristics of the GI systems and the extension of their production areas, are crucial.",Geographical indications (GIs),Climate disaster risk,Agri-food sector,Veneto region,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined disparities in geographical trends of HIV epidemics among people who inject drugs (PWIDs), female sex workers (FSWs) and hijra/transgender/male sex workers (H/MSWs), in Pakistan.Methods The UNAIDS Estimation and Projection Package (EPP) mathematical model was used to explore geographical trends in HIV epidemics. Four rounds of mapping and surveillance data collected among key populations (KPs) across 20 cities in Pakistan between 2005-2011 was used for modeling. Empirical estimates of HIV prevalence of each KP in each city were used to fit the model to estimate prevalence and incidence over time.Results HIV incidence among PWIDs in Pakistan reached its peak in 2011, estimated at 45.3 per 1000 person-years. Incidence was projected to continue to rise from 18.9 in 2015 to 24.3 in 2020 among H/MSWs and from 3.2 in 2015 to 6.3 in 2020 among FSWs. The number of people living with HIV in Pakistan was estimated to steadily increase through at least 2020. HIV incidence peak among PWIDs ranged from 16.2 in 1997 in Quetta to 71.0 in 2010 in Faisalabad (per 1000 person-years). Incidence among H/MSWs may continue to rise through 2020 in all the cities, except in Larkana where it peaked in the early 2000s. In 2015, model estimated incidence among FSWs was 8.1 in Karachi, 6.6 in Larkana, 2.0 in Sukkur and 1.2 in Lahore (per 1000 person-years).Conclusions There exists significant geographical heterogeneity in patterns and trends of HIV sub-epidemics in Pakistan.

Understanding spatial heterogeneity is essential for evidence-based policymaking in high-risk geographical areas. Moreover, there is a paucity of research on the utilization of PNC and its geographical inequalities in India. Therefore, this paper aims to identify the geographical variations in PNC use and associated socio-demographic factors among Indian women. A cross-sectional study was conducted using the 2015-2016 National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) data. A total of 190,898 women aged 15-49 years who had a live birth in the past five years preceding the survey were utilized in this study. This study assessed the levels of PNC use across geographical regions, states, and districts. Moran's 'I' and spatial autocorrelation were carried out to identify the spatial patterns of PNC use. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were employed to examine the factors associated with PNC utilization. In India, the proportion of PNC usage was 69.1% with marked variations across geographical regions. Lower use of PNC was found in the north, central, east, and northeast regions, while PNC utilization was higher in south, followed by west region of the country. This study found that educational attainment of women and household wealth status was positively correlated with PNC utilization. Women with higher education were more likely to receive PNC (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.57, 95% CI 1.49-1.65) compared to uneducated women. The odds of PNC use were 2.57 times higher (AOR: 2.57, 95% CI 2.44-2.70) among the women from the richest wealth quintile than those from the poorest wealth quintile. Furthermore, social groups, religion, women's age, age at marriage, birth order, child wantedness, and geographical region had a significant association with PNC healthcare-seeking. The findings of this study indicate evidence-based maternal healthcare programs to mitigate the identified geographical inequalities in PNC usage. Furthermore, this study suggests state- and region-specific healthcare interventions and strengthening of existing policies to improve the utilization of PNC in India.",Postnatal care (PNC),Geographical variations,LISA,India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many studies identified the factors affecting carbon emission in China and the USA (emitting more than 40% of the global CO2 emission), however, few studies considered stratified heterogeneity or the interactions of factors. Here, we adopted the modified Geographical Detector tool to investigate the main drivers of carbon emission from the perspective of stratified heterogeneity. The results of this analysis showed that human economic activities in China were the dominant effect of carbon emission changes, while energy intensity contributed toward controlling the carbon emission in China. Furthermore, population growth was the most significant driving force followed by energy intensity toward controlling the carbon emission of the USA. All these factors are mutually enhancing in changing carbon emissions, while oil share with energy intensity and coal share were more significantly enhanced in China's carbon emission than other interactions. The factors of human activities and energy mix posed a more powerful effect when they mutually enhanced each other to change carbon emission compared to other enhancing interactions.

Generalized dissimilarity modeling (GDM) was run to test which environmental variables were the best predictors of beta diversity components. Mantel's test results revealed that total beta diversity was positively related with environmental heterogeneity in almost all periods. GDM analysis results showed that total beta and turnover were related to temperature, organic suspended matter, dissolved oxygen, NH4, and pH, while nestedness was influenced by depth and geographic distances.

Exploring the properties correlated to the spatial pattern of the river density serves an essential role in understanding the water history on Mars. However, there is considerable debate regarding the properties related to the distribution of river density. We propose that these discussions arise from the complex interactions and the spatial heterogeneity of multiple properties. In our study, we employed the geodetector to examine the spatial correlation between the river density and multiple geographical properties including landform conditions, hydrous mineral, sedimentary fans, deltas, and lakes. Our findings reveal that the most correlated properties on river density vary by regions. And the explanatory power of an individual property was often enhanced in a nonlinear way when interacting with other properties. We hypothesize that the impact events were a major process responsible for global-scale fluvial valley formation on Mars. Furthermore, the local mechanisms of fluvial formation vary by region, reflecting regional differences in geomorphic, geological, and environmental conditions.

Therefore, farmers and processors consider the protection of GIs as Intellectual Property Rights as a tool for product differentiation and a solution for reducing misuse or free-riding. However GI-registration requires collective action and considerable efforts borne by multiple actors. According to the diverse GI-legal schemes, such as the EU framework, farmers and processors have to agree on the delimitation of the geographical area, production techniques and product quality characteristics contained in the Product Specification. Our paper enters for the first time into the black box of the GI-registration processes by analysing five Protected Geographical Indications in Colombia, Italy and Austria. Cases were selected among products registered according to the EU legislation (EC Regulations 2081/92, 510/2006 and 1151/2012) to represent supply chains of different length (e.g. short and long) and complexity (e.g. number of producers involved). We aim to identify the most critical and (time) demanding phases during the GI-registration processes and the type of private and public actors involved (e.g., farmers, processors, local public authorities, research staff) as well as to quantify their (collective) efforts and degree of involvement (e.g., consultation/co-decision vs. informing about decisions on behalf of others) and to analyse the outcome of the higher or lower involvement of actors. Cross-case comparisons are guided by the Institutional Analysis and Development Framework and the empirical transaction cost analysis. Results show that collective efforts borne by producers and related GI-stakeholders and the resulting collective outcomes are affected by institutional frameworks, group size and heterogeneity as well as ex-ante organisational robustness. Well-established pre-existing producer organisations and the support of local public authorities are critical factors along the GI-registration process. Participatory processes, even if time consuming, may result in a co-learning process as GI-stakeholders can attain better awareness of the product specificities and develop collective strategies and initiatives that should go far beyond the mere GI-registration. This article also adds to the still very small body of the empirical transaction costs analysis.

Using spatial autocorrelation analysis, GeoDetector analysis, and geographical weighted regression, the mechanism by which the migration behavior of the rural population impacts their contracted land disposal methods was analyzed in this study, and the spatial heterogeneity of this mechanism was further revealed from the perspective of geographical differentiation. The results of this study show that: (1) Chinese rural migrants exhibit pronounced geographical differences in the disposition of contracted land. The spatial distribution patterns of family operation, subleasing, and abandonment are different. (2) Migration behavior contributes to the differences in contracted land disposal methods across regions. Educational attainment, the number of cities migrated to, and the house purchase rate significantly contribute to the geographical differences among all three contracted land disposal methods. (3) The mechanisms by which migration behavior influences rural migrants' land disposal decisions vary. The direction and degree of the influence of each factor on family operation are relatively consistent across regions.

DSM allows legacy spectrum owners to lease their channels to unlicensed spectrum consumers (or secondary users) in order to increase their revenue and improve spectrum utilization. In DSM, determining the optimal spectrum leasing price is an important yet challenging problem that requires a comprehensive understanding of market participants' interests and interactions. In this paper, we study spectrum pricing competition in a duopoly DSM, where two wireless service providers (WSPs) lease spectrum access rights, and secondary users (SUs) purchase the spectrum use to maximize their utility. We identify two essential, but previously overlooked, properties of DSM: 1) heterogeneous spectrum resources at WSPs and 2) spectrum sharing among SUs. We demonstrate the impact of spectrum heterogeneity via an in-depth measurement study using a software-defined radio (SDR) testbed. We then study the impacts of spectrum heterogeneity on WSPs' optimal pricing and SUs' WSP selection strategies using a systematic three-step approach. First, we study how spectrum sharing among SUs subscribed to the same WSP affects the SUs' achievable utility. Then, we derive the SUs' optimal WSP selection strategy that maximizes their payoff, given the heterogeneous spectrum propagation characteristics and prices. We analyze how individual SU preferences affect market evolution and prove the market convergence to a mean-field limit, even though SUs make local decisions. Finally, given the market evolution, we formulate the WSPs' pricing strategies in a duopoly DSM as a noncooperative game and identify its Nash equilibrium points. We find that the equilibrium price and its uniqueness depend on the SUs' geographical density and spectrum propagation characteristics. Our analytical framework reveals the impact of spectrum heterogeneity in a real-world DSM, and can be used as a guideline for the WSPs' pricing strategies.",Cognitive radios,dynamic spectrum market,game theory,spectrum heterogeneity,spectrum pricing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study assessed the geographical variations in the impact of environmental quality on physical inactivity among U.S. adults. Data on county-level prevalence of leisure-time physical inactivity came from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. County environment was measured by the Environmental Quality Index (EQI), a comprehensive index of environmental conditions that affect human health. The overall EQI consists of five subdomainsair, water, land, social, and built environment. Geographically weighted regressions (GWRs) were performed to estimate and map county-specific impact of overall EQI and its five subdomains on physical inactivity prevalence. The prevalence of leisure-time physical inactivity among U.S. counties was 25% in 2005. On average, one standard deviation decrease in the overall EQI was associated with an increase in county-level prevalence of leisure-time physical inactivity by nearly 1%. However, substantial geographical variations in the estimated environmental determinants of physical inactivity were present. The estimated changes of county-level prevalence of leisure-time physical inactivity resulted from one standard deviation decrease of the overall EQI ranged from an increase of over 3% to a decrease of nearly 2% across U.S. counties.

Their objectives include encouraging diversification of agricultural production, improving farmers' income, countering depopulation of rural areas, satisfying consumer demand for high-quality good, and protecting consumers from food fraud. The authors argue that such objectives are not necessarily aligned as divergence may arise among stakeholders (such as farmers, consumers or rural communities) about the optimal design of the GI. The paper aims to discuss these issues.Design/methodology/approach - The authors developed a simple, static game-theory model describing the basic choices that a planner faces in designing a GI.Findings - The authors conclude that the optimal organization requires finding trade-offs among conflicting but equally desirable objectives. Perfect monitoring is not a sufficient condition to resolve such conflicts. Sub-consortia and flexible production agreements may increase the efficiency of a GI.Research limitations/implications - The authors described basic trade-offs in GI design using the simplest possible model. To this purpose the authors introduced limiting assumptions that may be relaxed in future research. The representation of the GI agreement focussed on the quality level only, abstracting from all other consideration. Using a static model prevented us from explicit modeling of (loss of) reputation effects. The simplifying assumptions about consumer behavior and cost functions have reduced the generality of the results. Extensions of the model may consider introducing additional elements in the GI agreement such as production areas or governance models, dynamic games and general functional forms.Practical implications - The authors found that in designing a GI: first, promotion approaches revolving around small groups of local leaders (i.e. efficient, high-quality producers) might overshoot quality, resulting in unsustainable production agreements; second, introducing degrees of flexibility in the production agreement may help achieving a sustainable GI; and finally, sub-consortia/optional labels may help dealing with producers' heterogeneity.Social implications - The authors found that setting a high standard in the production agreement is not sufficient condition for delivering quality food to consumers, as producers might have incentive to commit frauds. A simple command and control approach to quality in GI's is not always the most efficient strategy, because it may reduce participation. In designing the GI, the goals of identity preservation and food quality must be balanced with consideration of producers' incentives. The involvement of producers in the design of the GI is a critical success driver. Yet, this practice can be problematic because of producers' heterogeneity.Originality/value - The paper provides theoretical foundation for best practices in forming a GI, including: multi-stakeholder involvement, management of farmer heterogeneity and monitoring.",Rural development,Design,Endogenous quality,Frauds,Geographical indication,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An important indicator of progress towards malaria elimination is the prevalence of parasite infections in endemic populations. Information about malaria epidemiology is mostly derived from reports of confirmed acute malaria cases through passive case detection, whereas the prevalence of baseline subclinical malaria infections is much less known.Methods: In this study, cross-sectional surveys were conducted during the rainy season of 2017 in four townships (Bilin, Thabeikkyin, Banmauk and Paletwa) of Myanmar with divergent annual malaria incidences. A total of 1991 volunteers were recruited from local villages and Plasmodium subclinical infections were estimated by light microscopy (LM), rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and nested PCR. The nested PCR analysis was performed with a modified pooling strategy that was optimized based on an initial estimate the infection prevalence.Results: The overall malaria infection prevalence based on all methods was 13.9% (277/1991) and it differed drastically among the townships, with Paletwa in the western border having the highest infection rate (22.9%) and Thabeikkyin in central Myanmar having the lowest (3.9%). As expected, nested PCR was the most sensitive and identified 226 (11.4%) individuals with parasite infections. Among the parasite species, Plasmodium vivax was the most prevalent in all locations, while Plasmodium falciparum also accounted for 32% of infections in the western township Paletwa. Two RDTs based on the detection of the hrp2 antigen detected a total of 103 P. falciparum infections, and the ultrasensitive RDT detected 20% more P. falciparum infections than the conventional RDT. In contrast, LM missed the majority of the subclinical infections and only identified 14 Plasmodium infections.Conclusions: Cross-sectional surveys identified considerable levels of asymptomatic Plasmodium infections in endemic populations of Myanmar with P. vivax becoming the predominant parasite species. Geographical heterogeneity of subclinical infections calls for active surveillance of parasite infections in endemic areas. The pooling scheme designed for nested PCR analysis offers a more practical strategy for large-scale epidemiological studies of parasite prevalence.

Since the cloning of the BRCA1/2 genes, it is known that the wide spectrum of deleterious mutations shows high ethnic and geographic heterogeneity. In this study, we have tested probands from 582 breast/ovarian cancer families and positioned all 156 BRCA1/2 families on the map according to the family origin. We observed that high-risk families with the same recurrent mutation present a typical geographical distribution and that different recurrent mutations may show different distribution patterns. We then evaluated the genetic screening implications of this heterogeneous prevalence of the most recurrent mutations found [300T>G(c.181T>G), 1806C>T(c.1687C>T), 969ins7(c.844_850dupTCATTAC), 5382insC(c.5266dupC), 235G>A(c.116G>A) in BRCA1 and IVS16-2A>G(c.7806-2A>G) in BRCA2]. On the basis of these results, specific testing procedures for new incident cases may be offered according to their family origins and, according to the information regarding clusters revealed in this study, the individuals (especially those at low risk), originating from regions with clusters, might be screened preferentially for cluster mutations and analysis may be simplified according to the family origin.",BRCA1,BRCA2,genetic testing,geographical distribution,recurrent mutations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Slovenia,,,,,

Monetary and non-monetary support is closely related to the physical and psychological well-being of the elderly. Three waves of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) are used to identify a causal effect of the location of the adult offspring on outcomes such as financial transfers to the parents and provision of emotion/physical support. We find that the effects vary with the type of support. The effect of geographical distance on financial support sent by adult children to elderly parents shows a semi-inverted 'U-shaped' trend that first increases and then slowly decreases. The frequency of visit by the adult child to elderly parents decreases significantly as distance increase. Further analysis examines the heterogeneity of these effects. The paper combines theoretical and empirical evidence to illustrate how adult children make use of their limited time and money to provide parental support when they migrate different distances from home.,Aging,rural-urban migration,geographical distance,intergenerational support,resource allocation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,rural China,,,,,

Research on health and its influencing factors can help improve health status. There is limited research on the spatial stratified heterogeneity of health status and the interactions between the factors influencing it. This study aimed to analyze the spatial characteristics of health outcomes in Beijing and identify its influencing factors.Methods Based on the Healthy Beijing Initiative (2020-2030), we constructed health outcomes and five dimensions of the SDOH evaluation system. Our study measured the health outcomes and SDOH based on the latest data from 16 districts in Beijing in 2020-2022. We explored the spatial characteristics of health outcomes through descriptive and spatial autocorrelation analyses. Moreover, the Geographical Detector (GeoDetector) technique has been used to reveal the effect of SDOH and its interactions on health outcomes.Results A significant spatial stratified heterogeneity of health outcomes was observed, with the health outcomes mainly exhibiting two clustering types (high-high and low-low) with positive autocorrelation. The results of the geodetector showed that social and economic factors (q = 0.85), healthy lifestyle (q = 0.68) and health service (q = 0.53) could mainly explain the heterogeneity of health outcomes.

To determine the spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between fractal dimensions and influencing factors, we examined the spatial distribution characteristics of fractal dimensions using spatial autocorrelation analysis, selected population, build-up area density, and road network density as the explanatory variables, and established the global regression model and local regression model using ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR), respectively. The results indicated that the spatial distribution of fractal dimensions of the urban road network exhibited an obvious tendency toward geographical dependency. Considering the spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between the fractal characteristics of the road network and the influencing factors not only improves the reliability of analysis but also helps planners and decision-makers grasp the morphological characteristics of the urban road network and estimate the evolution of the road network, thereby promoting the development of urban road networks in a more orderly, efficient, and sustainable direction.",road network,spatial heterogeneity,fractal characteristics,spatial autocorrelation,GWR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, contemporary gridded climate products suffer critical problems mainly related to sub-optimal pixel size and lack of local topography-driven temperature heterogeneity. Here, by integrating meteorological station data, high-quality terrain information and multivariate modelling, we aim to explicitly demonstrate this deficiency. Monthly average temperatures (1981-2010) from Finland, Sweden and Norway were modelled using generalized additive modelling under (1) a conventional (i.e. considering geographical location, elevation and water cover) and (2) a topoclimatic framework (i.e. also accounting for solar radiation and cold-air pooling). The performance of the topoclimatic model was significantly higher than the conventional approach for most months, with bootstrapped mean R-2 for the topoclimatic model varying from 0.88 (January) to 0.95 (October). The estimated effect of solar radiation was evident during summer, while cold air pooling was identified to improve local temperature estimates in winter. The topoclimatic modelling exposed a substantial temperature heterogeneity within coarser landscape units (>5 degrees C/1 km(-2) in summer) thus unveiling a wide range of potential microclimatic conditions neglected by the conventional approach. Moreover, the topoclimatic model predictions revealed a pronounced asymmetry in average temperature conditions, causing isotherms during summer to differ several hundreds of metres in altitude between the equator and pole facing slopes. In contrast, cold-air pooling in sheltered landscapes lowered the winter temperatures ca. 1.1 degrees C/100m towards the local minimum altitude. Noteworthy, the analysis implies that conventional models produce biassed predictions of long-term average temperature conditions, with errors likely to be high at sites associated with complex topography.",topoclimate,temperature heterogeneity,asymmetry,generalized additive models,local climate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While predation risk is rarely constant in natural populations, the extent to which variation in predation risk shapes individual behaviour in wild populations remains unclear. Here, we investigated individual differences in reproductive behaviour in 16 Trinidadian guppy populations and related it to the observed variation in predator biomass each population experienced. Our results show that high heterogeneity in predator biomass is linked to individual behavioural diversification. Increased within-population heterogeneity in predator biomass is also associated with behavioural polymorphism. Some individuals adjust the frequency of consensual mating behaviour in response to differences in sex ratio context, while others display constantly at elevated frequencies. This pattern is analogous to a 'live fast, die young' pace-of-life syndrome. Notably, both high and low mean differences in predator biomass led to a homogenization of individual frequency of consensual mating displays. Overall, our results demonstrate that individual behavioural variation is associated with heterogeneity in predator biomass, but not necessarily with changes in mean values of predator biomass. We suggest that heterogeneity in predator biomass is an informative predictor of adaptive responses to changes in biotic conditions.",personality,predation risk,heterogeneity,behavioural diversification,sexual behaviour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper aims to explore the structure of relationships within the maritime logistics network and determine why they vary.Design/methodology/approachInterviews were carried out with 41 practitioners involved in the Taiwanese maritime logistics network. The data from these interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis and quasi-quantification.FindingsThe interviews identify that structural holes exist within this maritime logistics network, and that these particularly influence the relationships within this sector with ports being significantly affected. However, five factors are particularly identified that can further impact the strength of these relationships. Often, weak links between ports and both cargo owners and freight forwarders emerge as value-added services are provided by the network.Research limitations/implicationsThe findings are framed in a Taiwanese context, where cultural and political norms may give different results to other geographical regions.

Existing literature, however, mainly focuses on the conformity approach and does not take the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of UPI into account. In addition, previous research failed to distinguish the effects of urban planning from other institutional forces, as well as market incentives on urban expansion. To bridge this gap, we proposed a spatiotemporal approach to evaluate the effectiveness of UPI based on logistic regression and geographical information system (GIS) by identifying the spatiotemporal heterogeneous effects of urban planning on urban expansion. An empirical research was conducted in the Beijing Metropolitan Area (BMA) by analyzing five urban master plans drafted in 1958, 1973, 1982, 1992 and 2004. Five periods from 1947 to 2008 were examined to evaluate the dynamic effects of each master plan and other related factors. The effects of the 2004 Urban Master Plan on 16 districts in Beijing were estimated to identify the spatial variations of UPI. Within the context of China's booming economy, the results indicate that the effects of urban planning during the urban expansion increase over time, and are significantly stronger in exurban areas than in central cities and suburban areas. In addition, based on logistic regression results, we adopted an existing urban expansion simulation model to geographically visualize the impact of urban planning on future urban expansion, namely urban planning implementation effectiveness.

Many researchers have focused on the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of permafrost in NEC, however, few studies have delved into the field scale. In this study, based on the Optimal Parameters-based Geographical Detector (OPGD) model and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) test, the spatial stratified heterogeneity of permafrost distribution and the indicating performance of environmental variables on permafrost in NEC at the field scale were analyzed. Permafrost spatial distribution data were obtained from the Engineering Geological Investigation Reports (EGIR) of six highways located in NEC and a total of 19 environmental variables related to heat transfer, vegetation, soil, topography, moisture, and ecology were selected. The H-factors (variables with the highest contribution in factor detector results and interaction detector results): slope position (gamma), surface frost number (SFN), elevation (DEM), topographic diversity (TD), and annual snow cover days (ASCD) were found to be the major contributors to the distribution of permafrost at the field scale. Among them, gamma has the highest contribution and is a special explanatory variable for permafrost. In most cases, interaction can improve the impact of variables, especially the interaction between H-factors. The risk of permafrost decreases with the increase of TD, RN, and SBD, and increases with the increase of SFN. The performance of SFN to indicate permafrost distribution was found to be the best among all variables (AUC = 0.7063).

Rare cancers were defined using site- and histology-based categories from the European RARECARE study, as individual cancer types having crude annual incidence rates of less than 6/100 000.

Males and those living in more remote or more disadvantaged areas had higher incidence but lower survival. There was substantial evidence for spatial variation in both incidence and survival for rare cancers between small geographical areas across Australia, with similar patterns so that those areas with higher incidence tended to have lower survival.

Studying spatiotemporal heterogeneity of customer preferences is crucial to engineering design as it provides a dynamic perspective for a thorough understanding of preference trend. However, existing analytical models for demand modeling do not take the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of customer preferences into consideration. To fill this research gap, a spatial panel modeling approach is developed in this study to investigate the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of customer preferences by introducing engineering attributes explicitly as model inputs in support of demand forecasting in engineering design. In addition, a step-by-step procedure is proposed to aid the implementation of the approach. To demonstrate this approach, a case study is conducted on small SUV in China's automotive market. Our results show that small SUVs with lower prices, higher power, and lower fuel consumption tend to have a positive impact on their sales in each region. In understanding the spatial patterns of China's small SUV market, we found that each province has a unique spatial specific effect influencing the small SUV demand, which suggests that even if changing the design attributes of a product to the same extent, the resulting effects on product demand might be different across different regions. In understanding the underlying social-economic factors that drive the regional differences, it is found that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, length of paved roads per capita and household consumption expenditure have significantly positive influence on small SUV sales. These results demonstrate the potential capability of our approach in handling spatial variations of customers for product design and marketing strategy development.

However, the distribution patterns of soil moisture are spatially heterogenous and influenced by multiple environmental factors. The knowledge is still limited in assessing the large-scale spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture in in situ data modelling, in situ network design, spatial down-scaling, and remote sensing-based soil moisture retrieval. Heterogeneity models are effective in characterizing spatial disparities, but they are not capable of examining the maximum regional disparities. To address this bottleneck, the authors of this study developed a geographically optimal zones-based heterogeneity (GOZH) model. By progressively optimizing geographical zones of soil moisture and quantifying the heterogeneity among zones, GOZH may help identify individual and interactive determinants of soil moisture across a large study area. It was applied to identify spatial determinants of in situ soil moisture data collected at 653 monitoring stations in the Northern Hemisphere in unfrozen and frozen seasons from April 2015 to December 2017, with only thawed data considered in both seasons. Correspondingly, a series of variables were derived from Google Earth Engine (GEE) remote sensing data. The results demonstrated the significant regional disparities of soil moisture, and the combinations of determinants are critically different among geographical zones and between unfrozen and frozen seasons. At a global scale, the combinations of determinants can explain about 48% of the spatial pattern of soil moisture. Spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture in frozen seasons is much more complex than that in unfrozen seasons regarding geographical zones and explanatory variables. The variability of soil moisture during unfrozen seasons can be more explainable than that during frozen seasons, which was a convincing evidence for previous studies that soil moisture predictions were mostly performed during unfrozen seasons. Primary variables that determine spatial patterns of soil moisture are changed from climate variables during the unfrozen season to geographical variables during the frozen season. Results show that GOZH model can effectively explore spatial determinants of soil moisture through avoiding the underestimation of individual variables, overestimation of multiple variables, and finely divide zones. The research findings from this study provide an in-depth understanding of the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture and can be implemented in more effective in situ sampling network design, spatial down-scaling of soil moisture, and accurate inversion of surface parameters from the satellite data of soil moisture.",Spatial heterogeneity,Soil moisture,Spatial determinants,Geographically optimal zones-based heterogeneity model,Google Earth Engine (GEE),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Spatial statistics,,,,,

Yet, little is known about the micro-geographical distribution of these two infections or associated disease within such foci. Such knowledge could give important insights into the drivers of infection and disease and as such better tailor schistosomiasis control and elimination efforts.Methodology In a co-endemic farming community in northern Senegal (346 children (0-19 y) and 253 adults (20-85 y); n=599 in total), we studied the spatial distribution of S. mansoni and S. haematobium single and mixed infections (by microscopy), S. mansoni-specific hepatic fibrosis, S. haematobium-specific urinary tract morbidity (by ultrasound) and water contact behavior (by questionnaire). The Kulldorff's scan statistic was used to detect spatial clusters of infection and morbidity, adjusted for the spatial distribution of gender and age.Principal FindingsSchistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium infection densities clustered in different sections of the community (p=0.002 and p=0.023, respectively), possibly related to heterogeneities in the use of different water contact sites. While the distribution of urinary tract morbidity was homogeneous, a strong geospatial cluster was found for severe hepatic fibrosis (p=0.001). Particularly those people living adjacent to the most frequently used water contact site were more at risk for more advanced morbidity (RR=6.3; p=0.043).Conclusions/SignificanceSchistosoma infection and associated disease showed important micro-geographical heterogeneities with divergent patterns for S. mansoni and S. haematobium in this Senegalese community. Further in depth investigations are needed to confirm and explain our observations. The present study indicates that local geospatial patterns should be taken into account in both research and control of schistosomiasis. The observed extreme focality of schistosomiasis even at community level, suggests that current strategies may not suffice to move from morbidity control to elimination of schistosomiasis, and calls for less uniform measures at a finer scale.Author Summary In the developing world, over 230 million people are infected with parasitic Schistosoma worms. Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium are the most abundant species in Africa, affecting the liver and urinary tract, respectively. Both parasites are spread through infested freshwater. Although it is known that the disease occurs focally within countries or regions, little is known on its geographic spread on a smaller scale. Here, we examined 599 people from a community in northern Senegal for S. mansoni and S. haematobium infections and related abnormalities of the liver and urinary tract. We recorded where they lived and where they had water contact and visualized this information in geographical maps. The study showed that each Schistosoma species clustered in a different section of the community, and that liver abnormalities were more severe near the mostly used water contact site.

The spatial cluster analysis identified clusters or outliers in every community, though with different spatial patterns. Household water insecurity was positively associated with food insecurity, round-trip fetching time, and water-related conflict within households and with neighbours.

We evaluated whether: (1) environmental heterogeneity (EH) is associated with the species and life-form richness of aquatic macrophytes; and (2) EH and geographical distance influence species composition in these coastal rivers. We recorded the macrophyte species and life form occurrence and collected explanatory variables characterising the water, sediment, and river channel at 100 sampling sites over 8 rivers. We applied a principal component analysis to the explanatory variables and calculated the rivers' EH using the range of principal component 1 scores. We also determined the position of each river mouth along the coastline to measure the distance between the rivers. We used quasi-Poisson generalised linear models to evaluate the effects of EH on richness of species and life forms. To determine the effect of EH and geographical distance (Euclidean distance matrices) on the variation in species composition (Jaccard dissimilarity matrix) among the rivers, we applied multiple regressions on distance matrices. The most heterogeneous river had heterogeneity score about five times greater than the least heterogeneous river. Sediment salinity, river width, total phosphorus concentration of water and distance from river mouth were the most important variables contributing to the rivers' EH. We found that EH did not explain variation in species richness; however, it had a significant positive relationship with life-form richness. The effect of EH was greater than that of the geographical distance on the variation in species composition among the rivers. The pairs of rivers with the most similar EH were the most similar in species composition, but not all of them were geographically close. We conclude that EH influences life-form richness but does not influence species richness of aquatic macrophytes in the coastal rivers we studied; however, EH does influence species composition regardless of geographical distance among rivers.",aquatic plants,coastal plain,estuaries,macrophyte composition,river heterogeneity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that wealth, language, geographical location and security each play an important role in explaining spatial variations in data availability in four different types of biodiversity databases. The number of records per square kilometre is high in countries with high per capita gross domestic product (GDP), high proportion of English speakers and high security levels, and those located close to the country hosting the database; but these are not necessarily countries with high biodiversity. These factors are considered to affect data availability by impeding either the activities of scientific research or active international communications. Our results demonstrate that efforts to solve environmental problems at a global scale will gain significantly by focusing scientific education, communication, research and collaboration in low-GDP countries with fewer English speakers and located far from Western countries that host the global databases; countries that have experienced conflict may also benefit.

In agricultural areas, heterogeneity of malaria transmission is often associated with the presence of hotspots consisting of localized clusters of higher transmission intensity. This study aims to identify micro-geographic hotspots of malaria transmission in an agricultural setting using a multidisciplinary approach.Methods Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted at the end of the dry season and at the peak of the rainy season in rural and urban sites in Bouna, northeastern Cote d'Ivoire. A total of 296 individuals from 148 farming households were randomly selected and sociological, geographical, entomological, and clinical data as well as blood samples were collected during each visit. Parasitological data and Anopheles exposure (measured using entomological and immunological methods) were compared with demographic, agricultural, and geographic data to identify drivers of malaria transmission. Heat maps combining these data were used to identify households with ongoing malaria transmission throughout the year.Results In rural areas, Plasmodium prevalence was consistent between the dry and the rainy seasons, with roughly half of the population infected. In urban areas, malaria transmission indicators were lower, with a parasite prevalence of less than 20%, which remained comparable between the dry and the rainy season. The presence of irrigated crops and proximity to wetlands were associated with increased Anopheles exposure. By mapping Plasmodium infection and Anopheles exposure, two different types of hotspots of malaria transmission were identified: micro-geographical scale and local scale hotspots.Conclusions The presence of wetlands in urban areas and irrigated agriculture in rural areas resulted in heterogeneity in malaria transmission on a micro-geographical scale. These specific households present particular risk of malaria transmission and could fuel malaria transmission in surrounding households. The identification of micro-geographical areas using heat maps combining several epidemiological parameters can help to identify hotspots of malaria transmission. The implementation of malaria control measures, such as seasonal chemoprophylaxis or vector control, in these areas could help to reduce the incidence of malaria and facilitate its elimination.",Malaria,Hotspot,Microgeographic heterogeneity,Agriculture practices,Anopheles exposure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we examine large-scale spatial variations in biomineralization under heterogeneous environmental gradients of temperature, salinity and food availability across a 30 degrees latitudinal range (3,334 km), to test whether plasticity in calcareous shell production and composition, from juveniles to large adults, mediates geographical patterns of resilience to climate change in critical foundation species, the mussels Mytilus edulis and M. trossulus. We find shell calcification decreased towards high latitude, with mussels producing thinner shells with a higher organic content in polar than temperate regions. Salinity was the best predictor of within-region differences in mussel shell deposition, mineral and organic composition. In polar, subpolar, and Baltic low-salinity environments, mussels produced thin shells with a thicker external organic layer (periostracum), and an increased proportion of calcite (prismatic layer, as opposed to aragonite) and organic matrix, providing potentially higher resistance against dissolution in more corrosive waters. Conversely, in temperate, higher salinity regimes, thicker, more calcified shells with a higher aragonite (nacreous layer) proportion were deposited, which suggests enhanced protection under increased predation pressure. Interacting effects of salinity and food availability on mussel shell composition predict the deposition of a thicker periostracum and organic-enriched prismatic layer under forecasted future environmental conditions, suggesting a capacity for increased protection of high-latitude populations from ocean acidification. These findings support biomineralization plasticity as a potentially advantageous compensatory mechanism conferring Mytilus species a protective capacity for quantitative and qualitative trade-offs in shell deposition as a response to regional alterations of abiotic and biotic conditions in future environments. Our work illustrates that compensatory mechanisms, driving plastic responses to the spatial structure of multiple stressors, can define geographical patterns of unanticipated species resilience to global environmental change.",biomineralization,calcification,climate change,compensatory mechanisms,multiple stressors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mytilus,,ocean acidification,resistance,,

Spatial pattern characteristics and identification of factors that influence water yield are the basis for decision making. However, there are limited studies on the driving mechanisms that affect the spatial heterogeneity of ecosystem services. In this study, we used the Hengduan Mountain region in southwest China, with obvious spatial heterogeneity, as the research site. The water yield module in the InVEST software was used to simulate the spatial distribution of water yield. Also, quantitative attribution analysis was conducted for various geomorphological and climatic zones in the Hengduan Mountain region by using the geographical detector method. Influencing factors, such as climate, topography, soil, vegetation type, and land use type and pattern, were taken into consideration for this analysis. Four key findings were obtained. First, water yield spatial heterogeneity is influenced most by climate-related factors, where precipitation and evapotranspiration are the dominant factors. Second, the relative importance of each impact factor to the water yield heterogeneity differs significantly by geomorphological and climatic zones. In flat areas, the influence of evapotranspiration is higher than that of precipitation. As relief increases, the importance of precipitation increases and eventually, it becomes the most influential factor. Evapotranspiration is the most influential factor in a plateau climate zone, while in the mid-subtropical zone, precipitation is the main controlling factor. Third, land use type is also an important driving force in flat areas. Thus, more attention should be paid to urbanization and land use planning, which involves land use changes, to mitigate the impact on water yield spatial pattern. The fourth finding was that a risk detector showed that Primarosol and Anthropogenic soil areas, shrub areas, and areas with slope <5 degrees and 25 degrees-35 degrees should be recognized as water yield important zones, while the corresponding elevation values are different among different geomorphological and climatic zones. Therefore, the spatial heterogeneity and influencing factors in different zones should be fully considered while planning the maintenance and protection of water yield services in the Hengduan Mountain region.",water yield service,Hengduan Mountain region,InVEST software,geographical detector,attribution analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The emerging connected ve-hicles technology provides us with a wealth of vehicular motion data, which enables a better connection between crash frequency and driving behaviors. However, appropriately dealing with the spatial dependence of crash frequency and multitudinous driving features has been a difficult but critical challenge in the prediction process. To this end, this study aims to investigate a new Artificial Intelligence technique called Geographical Random Forest (GRF) that can address spatial heterogeneity and retain all potential predictors. By harnessing more than 2.2 billion high-resolution connected vehicle Basic Safety Message (BSM) observations from the Safety Pilot Model Deployment in Ann Arbor, MI, 30 indicators of driving volatility are extracted, including speed, longi-tudinal and lateral acceleration, and yaw rate. The developed GRF was implemented to predict rear-end crash frequency at intersections. The results show that: 1) rear-end crashes are more likely to happen at intersections connecting minor roads compared to major roads; 2) a higher number of hard acceleration and deceleration events beyond two standard deviations in the longitudinal direction is a leading indicator of rear-end crashes; 3) the optimal GRF significantly outperforms Global Random Forest, with a 9% lower test error and a substantially better fit; and 4) geographical visualization of variable importance highlights the presence of spatial non-stationarity. The proposed framework can proactively identify at-risk intersections and alert drivers when leading indicators of driving volatility tend to worsen.",Connected vehicle,Crash frequency prediction,Geographical random forest,Variable importance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While many Internet service operators have at least partially powered their datacenters by green energy, it is challenging to effectively utilize green energy due to the intermittency of renewable sources, such as solar or wind. We find that the geographical diversity of internet-scale services can be carefully scheduled to improve the efficiency of applying green energy in datacenters. In this paper, we propose a holistic heterogeneity-aware cloud workload management approach, sCloud, that aims to maximize the system goodput in distributed self-sustainable datacenters. sCloud adaptively places the transactional workload to distributed datacenters, allocates the available resource to heterogeneous workloads in each datacenter, and migrates batch jobs across datacenters, while taking into account the green power availability and QoS requirements. We formulate the transactional workload placement as a constrained optimization problem that can be solved by nonlinear programming. Then, we propose a batch job migration algorithm to further improve the system goodput when the green power supply varies widely at different locations. Finally, we extend sCloud by integrating a flexible batch job manager to dynamically control the job execution progress without violating the deadlines. We have implemented sCloud in a university cloud testbed with real-world weather conditions and workload traces. Experimental results demonstrate sCloud can achieve near-to-optimal system performance while being resilient to dynamic power availability. sCloud with the flexible batch job management approach outperforms a heterogeneity-oblivious approach by 37 percent in improving system goodput and 33 percent in reducing QoS violations.",Sustainable datacenter,heterogeneity,job migration,optimization,system goodput,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,workload placement,,,,,

We first apply the grey relational degree to test for the quantitative relationships between the natural and socioeconomic factors and air pollution. We then employ a novel method, specifically, the geographical detector, from the perspective of spatial stratified heterogeneity to reveal the potential impacts and interaction impacts of the natural and socioeconomic factors on air pollution. The results are as follows. (1) The grey relational degree results reveal that all factors in the topographical and meteorological layer, pollution sources layer, economic development layer, and urbanization layer have high relational degrees, indicating that these factors are closely correlated with air pollution. (2) The factor detector analysis reveals that the PM2.5 factor has the biggest q value, indicating that it is the primary contributor to air pollution, followed by PM10 and elevation. (3) The interaction detector analysis reveals that the interaction of two factors plays a more important role in influencing air pollution than does each factor individually. Moreover, the interactions between pair factors of pollution sources are the strongest. (4) The risk detector analysis reveals that elevation and precipitation are negatively correlated with air pollution, whereas pollution and urbanization factors are positively correlated with air pollution. (5) Finally, two leading impact areas for atmospheric pollution, namely, the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration and the Wuhan metropolitan area are predominantly attributed to the combination of natural and urbanization factors, whereas Yunnan and Guizhou are the least impact areas for atmospheric pollution because of their topographical and meteorological factors.

The second extends this model to explicitly account for spatial autocorrelation of random parameters, instead of simply conditioning individual-specific estimates on population-level distributions and individuals' choices.

Genomic DNA was isolated using a set of Probe NA (DNA Technology, Russia), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Detection of INDEL markers hp5605, hp6405, hp340, hp1390, hp3660 was performed using PCR. Clustering of the identified INDEL genotypes and building a phylogenetic tree were performed using the BioNumerics 7.6 and GrapeTree software packages. 21 strains from the GenBank database with known geographical origin were used as reference strains. In 20 strains from Saint Petersburg, 13 individual genotypes were identified, while 17 strains belong to the European cluster (hpEurope), 2 strains belong to the hspEAsia cluster and one strain belongs to the hspWAfrica cluster. The most common genotype identified in the European cluster includes six strains from Saint Petersburg and two strains from the GenBank database. For further differentiation of these strains, the VNTR typing method was used, which allowed identifying eight individual genotypes in eight strains. Fifty-six studied russian strains are represented by thirty individual genotypes, which reflects the high heterogeneity of strains circulating in the European part of the Russian Federation. The most frequent genotype is represented by two hpEurope strains, one strain from the Astrakhan region, as well as 5 and 6 strains from the Rostov Region and Saint Petersburg, respectively.

The consistency of the sustainability assessment results derives from several practitioner's choices and assumptions, depending on materials, the technological processes as well as the geographical context, that may be sources of heterogeneity. Addressing the sources of heterogeneity in sustainability assessment deriving from data contexts, procedural decision-making methods, measurement procedures is critical, provided that all existing methodologies, such as Life Cycle Assessment, Exergy Analysis and methods derived from their combinations, leave an important role to the subjective judgment of the practitioner. Heterogeneity is thus related to the possible different perspectives in drawing decisions, which may, for instance, reflect into the selection of dissimilar inventorying for the impact evaluation as well as in the selection of the most suitable impact category: the effect is the uncertainty in the final results. Heterogeneity issue can be attributed to multiple dimensions, such as data sources, indicators and subjective perspectives. In this paper, the problem of facing the sources of heterogeneity in sustainability assessment is discussed by endeavoring the system design view as a kind of guideline to implement the Exergy-based Analysis within the Life Cycle Thinking. The Life Cycle Assessment and Exergetic Analysis approach is carried out not to improve the methods themselves, but to revisit the entire design process, to improve it, with the aim of driving the decision of the practitioner, to make the results of the assessment more comparable, regardless of their subjective choices. An industrial case study is taken as a reference to prove the approach proposed and to highlight gaps that have not yet been filled.

The understanding of the spatial relationships between ChO and socio-environmental status is critical in order to control this epidemic. In this paper, we investigate these relationships and consider empirical evidence from Athens, Greece. We examine the association between ChO and socioeconomic status (education level, family income) and living conditions (population density, land cover of green and recreational areas) by using both global and local statistical analyses. For this purpose, we used survey obesity data collected in 2007 from 18,296 students in the primary schools of Athens. Moreover, we investigated the significance and spatial inequalities of the association between ChO and socio-environmental conditions of the study area. The results from global statistical modeling showed that education level is the most significant predictor of ChO. Furthermore, local Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) modeling revealed that areas characterized by low educational level, high population density, low family income and limited coverage of green/recreation zones constituted an ""obesogenic"" environment. The findings of the proposed analysis promote our understanding of the factors influencing childhood obesity and may prove beneficial for the development of policies that target ChO.

During 1992-2016, the prevalence of underweight among children had declined from 53% to 36%, stunting had declined from 52% to 38% while that of wasting had increased from 17% to 21% in India. The national average in the level of malnutrition conceals large variation across districts of India. Using data from the recent round of National Family Health Survey (NFHS), 2015-16 this paper examined the spatial heterogeneity and meso-scale correlates of child malnutrition across 640 districts of India.Methods: Moran's / statistics and bivariate LISA maps were used to understand spatial dependence and clustering of child malnutrition. Multiple regression, spatial lag and error models were used to examine the correlates of malnutrition. Poverty, body mass index (BMI) of mother, breastfeeding practices, full immunization, institutional births, improved sanitation and electrification in the household were used as meso scale correlates of malnutrition.Results: The univariate Moran's I statistics was 0.65, 0.51 and 0.74 for stunting, wasting and underweight respectively suggesting spatial heterogeneity of malnutrition in India. Bivariate Moran's I statistics of stunting with BMI of mother was 0.52, 0.46 with poverty and - 0.52 with sanitation. The pattern was similar with respect to wasting and underweight suggesting spatial clustering of malnutrition against the meso scale correlates in the geographical hotspots of India. Results of spatial error model suggested that the coefficient of BMI of mother and poverty of household were strong and significant predictors of stunting, wasting and underweight. The coefficient of BMI in spatial error model was largest found for underweight (beta = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.29-0.48) followed by stunting (beta = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.14-0.33) and wasting (beta = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.01-0.22). Women's educational attainment and breastfeeding practices were also found significant for stunting and underweight.Conclusion: Malnutrition across the districts of India is spatially clustered.

The mixed logit results provide evidence for heterogeneity in supply response across farmers. To put these findings in a meaningful economic context, we use the results from both models to simulate estimates for aggregate acreage responses under two alternative salinity scenarios. We implement a method to simulate individual specific responses together with their confidence intervals, which provides additional insight into the composition of farmer heterogeneity. Based on these post-regression simulation results, we find the mixed logit model predicts an elasticity of aggregate acreage for salt-sensitive (hence higher value) crops that is an order of magnitude larger compared to that of the standard fixed coefficients logit method.

However, the effects of heterogeneity on species diversity have not been studied as widely at intermediate scales although differences among landscapes in local climate and habitat should maintain beta-diversity.Location Bailey ecoregions in the USA.Methods Using a geographically extensive dataset on bird distribution and abundance in 35 ecoregions, we tested for the effects of habitat and climate heterogeneity on beta-diversity at two discrete spatial scales: among sample points within landscapes, and among landscapes within ecoregions.Results Landscape-level beta-diversity typically accounted for 50% or more of gamma-diversity and was significantly and positively related to habitat heterogeneity (elevational range within an ecoregion) and climate heterogeneity (variation in potential evapotranspiration). Contrary to predictions, point-level beta-diversity was negatively related to habitat and climate heterogeneity, perhaps because heterogeneity constrains alpha-diversity at the landscape level. The geographical spatial separation of landscapes within an ecoregion did not significantly affect beta-diversity at either scale.Main conclusions Our results suggest that habitat selection and adaptation to local climate may be the primary processes structuring bird diversity among landscapes within ecoregions, and that dispersal limitation has a lesser role in influencing beta-diversity among landscapes.",Bailey ecoregions,Breeding Bird Survey,distance decay of similarity,diversity partitioning,environmental heterogeneity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,randomization,,,,,

The focus is on the relations between modern geography and European colonialism during the 'age of empire' (circa 1870-1914).  For writers as diverse as Joseph Conrad and Halford Mackinder, this was a moment of decisive importance for the making of the modern world.  Although the interplay between geography, modernity, and colonialism has recently attracted attention from the historians of geography, it is argued in this paper that they have often conceived the role of geographical knowledge in somewhat narrow terms.  The work of Edward Said is discussed at some length, as it highlights some of the key issues and dilemmas facing those who would rewrite critical histories of geographical discourse.  A totalising view of 'imaginative geographies' (such as those of Orientalism) is argued against, and instead the heterogeneity of geographical knowledges is emphasised.

In Portugal, colorectal cancer is one of the most incident cancers; thus, it is crucial to act to fight it. Knowledge of the geographical distribution of the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer can facilitate the execution of these actions and make them more effective.MethodsOur paper aims to describe and discuss the geographical patterns of colorectal cancer incidence and mortality in mainland Portugal municipalities (2007-2011). We used the Besag, York and Mollie (BYM) model to compute the relative risk (RR) and posterior probability (PP). We performed a cluster analysis with Global Moran's Index and Local Moran's Index (LISA). We ran a geographically weighted regression (GWR) to compare incidence and mortality patterns.ResultsIncidence and mortality have different distributions of RR values. The interval of RR concerning incidence was higher than the interval of RR concerning mortality. PP values reinforce the finding of higher heterogeneity of the incidence of colorectal cancer.The comparison of the cluster maps for incidence and mortality shows a few municipalities classified with the same cluster type in both maps. Additionally, the GWR results show that the percentage of RR mortality explained by RR incidence differs throughout mainland Portugal.From the comparison of our results with the prevalence of risk factors (at NUTS II level), the need to be aware of smoking habits, alcohol consumption and the unhealthy diet of the Portuguese population stands out.ConclusionsThere are differences in the geographical distribution of the RR incidence and RR mortality of colorectal cancer in mainland Portugal municipalities. Likewise, it is relevant to highlight the cluster of two municipalities with high RR values concerning colorectal cancer's incidence and mortality. Future research is necessary to explain the geographical differences in the distribution of colorectal cancer in mainland Portugal municipalities. Based on our findings, it may be interesting to examine the influence of smoking, alcohol consumption, diet and screening on colorectal cancer in greater detail.

From the taxi trajectories, approximately 1.5 million trips of anonymous customers are extracted on seven consecutive days. The globally spatio-temporal patterns of trips exhibit a significant daily regularity. Since each trip can be viewed as a displacement in the random walk model, the distributions of the distance and direction of the extracted trips are investigated in this research. The direction distribution shows an NEE-SWW-dominant direction, and the distance distribution can be well fitted by an exponentially truncated power law, with the scaling exponent beta = 1.2 +/- A 0.15. The observed patterns are attributed to the geographical heterogeneity of the study area, which makes the spatial distribution of trajectory stops to be non-uniform. We thus construct a model that integrates both the geographical heterogeneity and distance decay effect, to interpret the observed patterns. Our Monte Carlo simulation results closely match to the observed patterns and thus validate the proposed model. According to the proposed model, in a single-core urban area, the geographical heterogeneity and distance decay effect improve each other when influencing human mobility patterns. Geographical heterogeneity leads to a faster observed decay, and the distance decay effect makes the spatial distribution of trips more concentrated.",Intra-urban human mobility,Taxi trajectory,Geographical heterogeneity,Distance decay,Monte Carlo simulation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we use numerical dynamos driven by purely volumetric internal heating with imposed degree-1 heat flux heterogeneities to study mantle control on the past dynamo of Mars. We quantify both south-north and east-west magnetic field dichotomies from time-average properties that are calculated according to two different end member crust formation scenarios. Our results indicate that a moderate heat flux anomaly may have been sufficient for obtaining the observed dichotomy. Because of the excitation of a strong equatorial upwelling in the dynamo, the efficiency of a mantle heterogeneity centered at the geographical pole in producing a south-north dichotomy is much higher than that of an heterogeneity centered at the equator in producing an east-west dichotomy. These results argue against a significant True Polar Wander event with major planet re-orientation after the cessation of the dynamo. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In the literature, the problem of comparing heterogeneities of types or of sources of odors in two geographical areas has not yet been dealt with the due attention. The main reason is that methodological proposals for tests for heterogeneity comparisons are very rare. We propose a permutation test based on the comparison of linear combinations of sampling indices of heterogeneity. The good power behavior, especially for small differences of the degrees of heterogeneity of the two compared areas, is proved through a Monte Carlo simulation study. The application of the test for heterogeneity comparisons on the data of the survey on odor perceptions in the region of Este (Italy) performed in 2010 shows the usefulness of the proposed methodology, which can be added, as a complementary analysis, to the classical established techniques for studying the environmental impact of odors like dispersion models, dynamic olfactometry, smell maps determination, and others.

Currently, random forest (RF) and other machine learning models are widely used to estimate forest AGB, as they can effectively handle nonlinear relationships. However, by constructing a global model using all the samples collected from a study area, these models fail to account for the spatial heterogeneity in the AGB and cannot correct the prediction biases, thereby constraining the estimation accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we proposed a novel approach termed geographical random forest and empirical Bayesian kriging (GRFEBK). This hybrid model combines the localized modeling capability of geographical random forest (GRF) with the bias correction strength of empirical Bayesian kriging (EBK). GRF adapts RF to account for the spatial heterogeneity of the AGB, while EBK utilizes the spatial autocorrelation of residuals to correct the prediction deviations. This study was conducted in Hainan Island, utilizing spectral bands, vegetation indices, tasseled cap components derived from Landsat-8 imagery, backscattering coefficients from ALOS-2 synthetic aperture radar, topographic features, and the forest canopy height as the explanatory variables. A total of 195 forest aboveground biomass (AGB) samples were collected for modeling and assessing the predictive accuracy. The results demonstrate that, among the tested models, including GRFEBK, RF, support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), geographically weighted regression (GWR), GRF, and EBK, GRFEBK attains the highest R2 (0.78) and the lowest RMSE (36.04 Mg/ha) and RRMSE (22.87%), significantly outperforming the conventional models and using GRF or EBK alone. These results demonstrate that by accounting for local non-stationarity in AGB and correcting prediction biases, GRFEBK achieves significantly higher accuracy than conventional RF and other models. While the results are promising, the computational cost of GRFEBK and its performance under varying geographical conditions warrant further investigation at larger scales to assess its broader applicability. Nevertheless, GRFEBK provides an innovative and more reliable approach for accurate forest AGB estimation with great potential to support global forest resource monitoring.",forest aboveground biomass (AGB),machine learning,geographical random forest (GRF),empirical Bayesian kriging (EBK),estimation accuracy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the data of China's listed manufacturing companies from 2001 to 2020, this paper aims to assess the effect of the digital economy on manufacturing agglomeration and identify the transmission mechanism of this effect. The results show the following: (1) The digital economy significantly promotes the geographical agglomeration of the manufacturing industry, which is still valid on the basis of a series of robustness and endogeneity tests. (2) Mechanism analysis shows that the digital economy promotes manufacturing agglomeration by reducing transaction costs, increasing market potential and enhancing knowledge spillover. (3) Heterogeneity analysis shows that the effect is more significant in the samples of large enterprises, high-tech manufacturing, central and western regions, small and medium-sized cities and the west side of the ""Hu Huanyong Line"", which will greatly help the layout of the manufacturing industry break through the ""Hu Huanyong Line"" to achieve balanced development.

Moreover, few studies investigate the cross impact of extreme sampling on non-extreme simulation. Therefore, we extend previous research to investigate the cross impact and further examine whether the divisions of extremely high (EXH) and low (EXL) quantiles contribute equally to the simulation bias when employing the spatial stratified sampling. Statistical assessment demonstrates that the selection of extreme training sample does affect the non-extreme simulation. The model has the best performance (RMSE: 2.735, VE: 7.481, Bias: -0.033) when the least proportion (25%) of EXH and EXL was selected for training. Further analysis also indicated that the EXH and EXL divisions contribute unequally to the process. Particularly, the non-extreme simulation is more sensitive to the EXH training data with a steeper change rate of 0.043.

This indicates temporal heterogeneity in mapping the intercity travel network. On weekdays, the three major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou take prominent core positions, while cities that are tourism destinations or transportation hubs are more attractive during Golden Week.

However, laws governing GIs in the partner states of EAC vary in terms of the nature and scope of protection and the underlying regulatory structures, resulting into heterogeneity in GIs protection in each country. Amid this regulatory dilemma, this paper examines the GIs laws in EAC by bringing to the fore the obtaining substantive and procedural differences amongst the partner states to EAC. The paper, among others, proposes a centralized regional approach for GIs protection to attain EAC's objective.",cross border trade,Eastern Africa perspectives,geographical indications,intellectual property rights,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, in order to assess the spatial and seasonal variability in malaria transmission, vector data need to be collected repeatedly over time (at fixed geographical locations). Measurements collected at locations close to each other and over time tend to be correlated because of common exposures such as environmental or climatic conditions. Non-spatial statistical methods, when applied to analyze such data, may lead to biased estimates. We developed rigorous methods for analyzing sparse and spatially correlated data. We applied Bayesian variable selection to identify the most important predictors as well as the elapsing time between climate suitability and changes in entomological indices.Methods: Bayesian geostatistical zero-inflated binomial and negative binomial models including harmonic seasonal terms, temporal trends and climatic remotely sensed proxies were applied to assess spatio-temporal variation of sporozoite rate and mosquito density in the study area. Bayesian variable selection was employed to determine the most important climatic predictors and elapsing (lag) time between climatic suitability and malaria transmission. Bayesian kriging was used to predict mosquito density and sporozoite rate at unsampled locations. These estimates were converted to covariate and season-adjusted maps of entomological inoculation rates. Models were fitted using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation.Results: The results show that Anophele. gambiae is the most predominant vector (79.29%) and is more rain-dependant than its sibling Anophele. funestus (20.71%). Variable selection suggests that the two species react differently to different climatic conditions. Prediction maps of entomological inoculation rate (EIR) depict a strong spatial and temporal heterogeneity in malaria transmission risk despite the relatively small geographical extend of the study area.Conclusion: Malaria transmission is very heterogeneous over the study area. The EIR maps clearly depict a strong spatial and temporal heterogeneity despite the relatively small geographical extend of the study area.

However, current evaluations could be improved by considering: (1) The intersection of other relevant axes of inequity like age, sex, income and migration status; and (2) The existence of individual heterogeneity around averages. Therefore, using an established quality indicator (ie, dispensation of statins after acute myocardial infarction, AMI), we valuate both geographical and sociodemographic inequalities and illustrate how the analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy (AIHDA) enhances such evaluations.Population and methodsWe applied AIHDA and calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of regional and sociodemographic differences in the statin dispensations of 35 044 patients from 21 Swedish regions and 24 sociodemographic strata who were discharged from the hospital with an AMI diagnosis between January 2011 and December 2013. Following the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare, we used a benchmark value of 90%.ResultsDispensation of stains after AMI in Sweden did not reach the desired target of 90%. Regional differences were absent/very small (AUC=0.537) while sociodemographic differences were small (AUC=0.618). Women, especially those with immigrant background and older than 65 years, have the lowest proportions of statin dispensations after AMI.ConclusionsAs the AUC statistics are small, interventions trying to achieve the benchmark value should be universal.

The popularity of these indexes come mainly from their ease of use, interpretation and computation. In practice, heterogeneity could be present in the performance evaluation exercise due to differences between entities. For example, they could differ with respect to their ownership, geographical localization, economic infrastructure, resource endowments, social environment, and so on. As a result, composite indexes fail to capture the performance differences, as they are biased by the presence of heterogeneity. In this paper, we suggest a simple procedure to disentangle the heterogeneity gaps and pure performance differences in the composite indexes over time.

Contour tillage has been proved to be the most effictive measure for soil and water conservation in the Chinese Loess Plateau. Studies on the spatial heterogeneity of loess tilled surfaces will contribute to the understanding of the mechanism of erosion evolution. For this, a laboratory experiment was performed on contour tilled sloping surfaces where the hydrological-erosive processes were simulated. At different erosion stages, point cloud measurements were made using a terrestrial laser scanning system (TLS); then the heterogeneity depending on detrending and directionality were analysed by both the semivariogram method and the rescaled range analysis method. Results showed that: (1) the fractal dimensions D-S and D-R were equivalent when determined from either the semivariogram method or the rescaled range analysis method, although the semivariogram method appears to be more reliable in identifying the specific stage of the erosion evolution process; (2) the contour tilled microtopographies had an anisotropy behavior depending on direction; (3) the fractal dimension (either D-S or D-R) in different erosion stages was less than 1.5, which indicates that the microtopography of the sloping surface exhibits characteristics of persistent fractional Brownian motion and positive spatial autocorrelation. Irrespective of tillage measure and slope percentage, the sloping surface can be regarded as having random roughness. The results reveals a quantitative relationship between microtopography and sloping erosion. Also, it may provide guidance for further studies regarding the spatial variability and heterogeneity of various tilled slopes on the microtopographic scale.",Fractal dimension,microtopography,rescaled range analysis,semivariogram,spatial heterogeneity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,surface roughness,,,,,

Without detailed accounting of soil heterogeneity, which can be provided by geostatistics, farms lose a large amount of material and financial resources. The purpose of the study presented in the article is to study the spatial variability of soil acidity and moisture content in experimental plots using geostatistical research methods, substantiate their use in constructing cartograms of the studied properties, and determine the degree of influence of the anthropogenic factor on the heterogeneity of the studied properties. The object of the study was two experimental sites, laid on the territory of the Volozhin district of the Minsk region, in the area of the educational and geographical station ""Western Berezina"". They are represented by a forest area of 3.8 hectares. On these plots, 30 samples were taken and a plot of arable land adjacent to the forest with an area of 5.9 hectares, on which 37 samples were taken. The importance of primary statistical processing of information is shown, and the main stages of the geostatistical approach as a whole are reflected. When analyzing the anisotropy, it was possible to identify the presence of trends characterized by a second order polynomial, and to determine its direction for the studied soil properties in the studied areas. With the help of variogram analysis, an idea of the degree of variation of the studied properties at different hierarchical levels of the general heterogeneity of the areas was obtained, and a quantitative assessment of the accuracy of cartograms was obtained. In the course of geostatistical analysis, based on the residual variance values, it was determined that the studied indicators on the experimental plots can be successfully mapped using kriging and the resulting cartograms will be as close to reality as possible. A comparative characteristic of the final cartograms constructed by different interpolation methods is given, which substantiated the use of the method of geostatistical analysis in cases of high variability of data and the absence of normal distribution in them. When analyzing the anisotropy, the main trends in the variation of the studied parameters were revealed, in the direction of which the relief of the territory plays a dominant role, especially for humidity. A significant influence of anthropogenic impact on the processes of spatial distribution of acidity was established based on trends and obtained cartograms. This is reflected in the almost complete absence of the influence of the height difference on the pH value in KCl and is determined by the nature of the work on the introduction of toxic substances. It has been confirmed that there is an increase in moisture content in cultivated soils that are not permanently covered with vegetation.",geostatistics,heterogeneity of soil properties,variography,humidity,acidity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, identifying the nonlinear and spatiotemporal heterogeneity of factors contributing to NPP variation remains a challenge. This research employed the Theil-Sen trend, Hurst index, and nonparametric Mann-Kendall test methodologies through the utilization of Google Earth Engine (GEE) to detect monotonic trends in NPP, distinguishing between upward and downward trends. The influence of individual factors and their interactive effects on NPP changes were quantified using the optimized parameter-based geographical detector (OPGD) model. The findings revealed a general upward trend in NPP, exhibiting an average growth rate of around 85.06 gC m(-2).a(-1). Nevertheless, these rates of growth were not uniform, leading to noteworthy fluctuations spanning from 447.44 to 543.69 gC m(-2).a(-1). The eastern and central regions showcased relatively elevated NPP, whereas the western and southern regions demonstrated comparatively reduced levels. Roughly 51.66% of the areas displayed a rising trend in NPP, with 44.81% of the entire area indicating a noteworthy increase (p < 0.01), including both a substantial increase (p < 0.01) and a moderate increase (0.01 <= p < 0.05). The areas witnessing heightened NPP were predominantly situated in the northeastern, southeastern, northwestern sections, and the southwestern portion of Sichuan. The fluctuations in NPP trends displayed mild persistence or slight antipersistence traits, with regions where 0 < H < 0.5 constituting 80.26% of the overall area. Natural factors (such as elevation, mean annual temperature, NDVI, and topographic relief) along with human influences (changes in land use type) were identified as effectively accounting for the fluctuations in NPP. These factors demonstrated interactive effects on NPP, with the synergistic effect resulting in nonlinear enhancement and bilinear enhancement effects. The interaction between these two factors strengthened the influence of each individual factor. Identifying the optimal characteristics or ranges of these factors can facilitate ecological conservation and vegetation restoration. These factors exhibited interactive effects on NPP, with the synergistic effect resulting in nonlinear enhancement and bilinear enhancement effects.

Some of them calculated static stress transfer in subsurface induced by the occurrences of earthquakes. Most of their analyses ignored the spatial heterogeneity in subsurface, or only took into account the rigidity layering in the crust. On the other hand, a smaller scale heterogeneity of around hundreds of meters has been suggested by geophysical investigations. It is difficult to reflect that kind of heterogeneity in analysis models because accurate distributions of fluctuation are not well understood in many cases. Thus, the effect of the ignorance of the smaller scale heterogeneity on evaluating the earthquake triggering of volcanic eruptions is also not well understood. In the present study, we investigate the influence of the assumption of homogeneity on evaluating earthquake triggering of volcanic eruptions using finite element simulations. The crust is treated as a stochastic media with different heterogeneous parameters (correlation length and magnitude of velocity perturbation) in our simulations. We adopt exponential and von Karman functions as spatial auto-correlation functions (ACF). In all our simulation results, the ignorance of the smaller scale heterogeneity leads to underestimation of the failure pressure around a chamber wall, which relates to dyke initiation. The magnitude of the velocity perturbation has a larger effect on the tensile failure at the chamber wall than the difference of the ACF and the correlation length. The maximum effect on the failure pressure in all our simulations is about twice larger than that in the homogeneous case. This indicates that the estimation of the earthquake triggering due to static stress transfer should take account of the heterogeneity of around hundreds of meters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study quantified net primary production (NPP), water yield (WY), soil conservation (SC), sand fixation (SF), habitat quality (HQ) and total ecosystem service (TES) on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau (QTP), and then analyzed the spatial-temporal characteristics of ESs. The geographical detector model (GDM), geographically weighted regression (GWR) model, and constraint lines were used to explore the effects of influencing factors on ESs. The results showed that (1) NPP, WY, SC, HQ and TES showed an increasing trend from 2000 to 2018, while SF showed a decreasing trend. NPP, WY, SC and TES showed a spatial distribution pattern of ""high values in the southeast and low values in the northwest"", while the high values of SF were located in the northern QTP and the high values of HQ were located in the southern QTP. (2) NDVI was the key factor influencing NPP, SC, HQ and TES, and precipitation dominated WY, and SF was mainly influenced by Largest patch index (LPI). (3) In most of the study areas, the natural factors (precipitation, temperature, DEM, slope and NDVI) had positive effects on NPP, SC and TES and both positive and negative effects on WY, SF and HQ. The human factors (Resident, Road and LPI) had positive effects on HQ and both positive and negative effects on other ESs. There were mainly non-monotonic constraint effects of influencing factors on ESs. Overall, natural factors had a much stronger influence on ESs than human factors, and the interactions among factors were much stronger than their independent effects.

Some are only recently explored, although their true extent and geographical coverage are still not fully established. Both continental margins and mid-oceanic seafloors are much more complex ecologically, geologically, chemically and hydrodynamically than originally thought. As a result, fundamental patterns of species distribution first observed and explained in the context of relatively monotonous slopes and abyssal plains must now be re-evaluated in the light of this newly recognized habitat heterogeneity. Based on a global database of nematode genus composition, collected as part of the Census of Marine Life, we show that macrohabitat heterogeneity contributes significantly to total deep-sea nematode diversity on a global scale. Different deep-sea settings harbour specific nematode assemblages. Some of them, like coral rubble zones or nodule areas, are very diverse habitats. Factors such as increased substrate complexity in the case of nodules and corals seem to facilitate the co-existence of a large number of genera with different modes of life, ranging from sediment dwelling to epifaunal. Furthermore, strong biochemical gradients in the case of vents or seeps are responsible for the success of particular genera, which are not prominent in more typical soft sediments. Many nematode deep-sea genera are cosmopolitan, inhabiting a variety of deep-sea habitats and oceans, whereas only 21% of all deep-sea genera recorded are restricted to a single habitat. In addition to habitat heterogeneity, regional differences are important in structuring nematode assemblages. For instance, seeps from different regions yield different genera that thrive on the sulphidic sediments.

Our aim was to understand the relationships between the strength of the oligarchic patterns, diversities (alpha, beta and gamma), and five potential causes (elevational variability, soil heterogeneity, elevation, soil conditions and geographical extent).LocationThe Amazon-Andes transition in the Madidi region (Bolivia).MethodsWe established 398 plots of 0.1ha each, containing 121,183 individual woody plants belonging to 2390 species. Then we defined 500 sub-regions (= unique overlapping subsets of 50 plots from the pool of 398 plots) so they varied in extent from 220 to 17,700km(2) within the study area. We employed two independent path analyses to relate environmental characteristics and geographical extent of sub-regions to (1) oligarchic strength and (2) alpha, beta and gamma diversities. We used generalized linear models to relate diversities to different measures of oligarchic strength.ResultsOligarchies at larger extents were weaker, a trend strongly driven by the pure effect of area and, secondarily, by environmental heterogeneity. Oligarchies at higher elevations were weaker than expected, and oligarchies in acidic and nutrients-poor soils were not stronger than those in less stressful soils. Trends in oligarchic strength were inversely correlated with those of gamma and beta diversity: weaker oligarchies were found in species-rich and heterogeneous communities.Main conclusionsEnvironmental heterogeneity and low landscape connectivity limit the strength of the oligarchic pattern. Although diversities (particularly beta diversity) and oligarchic strength are closely related, they are somewhat differently driven by external factors. In particular, oligarchic strength is more sensitive to spatial extent and less sensitive to environmental heterogeneity than beta diversity. Finally, the study of oligarchic patterns should consider a priori expectations based on species richness and turnover.",commonness,elevational gradient,Madidi,rarity,soil heterogeneity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,species spatial distribution,,species turnover,tropical rain forest,,

The spatial model also showed that being divorced was positively associated with HIV infection, but only for 49.4 % of individuals residing in some northern counties. The non-spatial model suggested that service sector work was negatively associated with HIV infection. However, the spatial model indicated that service work was associated with HIV infection, but only for 23.0 % of patients living in some western counties.

To address the spatial attenuation effect of the influencing factors, we use the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) on samples of different spatial ranges, which include a total of 530 southern counties from 2015 to 2017.
