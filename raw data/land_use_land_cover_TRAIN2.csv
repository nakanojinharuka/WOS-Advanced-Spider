High-resolution aerial imagery is now being used for land cover classification. The Global Learning and Observations to Benefit, the Environment land cover image database, is created by citizen scientists worldwide who use their handheld cameras to take a set of six images per land cover site. These images have clutter due to man-made objects, and the pixel uncertainties result in incorrect labels. The problem of accurate labeling of these land cover images is addressed. An integrated architecture that combines Unet and DeepLabV3 for initial segmentation, followed by a weighted fusion model that combines the segmentation labels, is presented. The land cover images with labels are used for training the deep learning models. The fusion model combines the labels of five images taken from the north, south, east, west, and down directions to assign a unique label to the image sets. 2916 GLOBE images have been labeled with land cover classes using the integrated model with minimal human-in-the-loop annotation. The validation step shows that our architecture of labeling the images results in 90.97% label accuracy. Our fusion model can be used for labeling large databases of land cover classes from RGB images.",land use land cover classification,image segmentation,fusion model,GLOBE database,deep learning,DeepLab,UNet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is still a gap of annual land use and land cover (LULC) information in all Brazilian biomes in the country. Existing countrywide efforts to map land use and land cover lack regularly updates and high spatial resolution time-series data to better understand historical land use and land cover dynamics, and the subsequent impacts in the country biomes. In this study, we described a novel approach and the results achieved by a multi-disciplinary network called MapBiomas to reconstruct annual land use and land cover information between 1985 and 2017 for Brazil, based on random forest applied to Landsat archive using Google Earth Engine. We mapped five major classes: forest, non-forest natural formation, farming, non-vegetated areas, and water. These classes were broken into two sub-classification levels leading to the most comprehensive and detailed mapping for the country at a 30 m pixel resolution. The average overall accuracy of the land use and land cover time-series, based on a stratified random sample of 75,000 pixel locations, was 89% ranging from 73 to 95% in the biomes. The 33 years of LULC change data series revealed that Brazil lost 71 Mha of natural vegetation, mostly to cattle ranching and agriculture activities. Pasture expanded by 46% from 1985 to 2017, and agriculture by 172%, mostly replacing old pasture fields. We also identified that 86 Mha of the converted native vegetation was undergoing some level of regrowth. Several applications of the MapBiomas dataset are underway, suggesting that reconstructing historical land use and land cover change maps is useful for advancing the science and to guide social, economic and environmental policy decision-making processes in Brazil.",land use,land cover change,Landsat,random forest,time-series,Brazilian biomes,,"Parente, Leandro L.","Alencar, Ane A.","Rudorff, Bernardo F.

A series of approaches are used to analyse differences in land cover change from data held in change matrices. These are contingency tables and are commonly used in remote sensing to describe the spatial coincidence of land cover recorded over two time periods. Comparative analyses of regional change are developed using odds ratios to analyse data in two regions. These approaches are extended using generalised linear models to analyse data for three or more regions. A generalised Poisson regression model is used to generate a comparative index of change based on differences in change likelihoods. Mosaic plots are used to provide a visual representation of statistically surprising land use losses and gains. The methods are explored using a hypothetical but tractable dataset and then applied to a national case study of coastal land use changes over 50 years conducted for the National Trust. The suitability of the different approaches to different types of problem and the potential for their application to land cover accuracy measures are briefly discussed.,land cover change,statistical analysis,land use change,visualization,remote sensing accuracy,,,"Fisher, Peter","Johnson, Sarah C.

A drive transect was done for ground truthing. Data were analysed spatially in a Geographical Information System environment. Changes in land cover and land use proportions were recorded from 1995 to 2010 throughout the Driefontein IBA. The land cover classes of grassland and wetland showed a decrease, whereas land area under cultivation increased during 1995-2010. However, the woodland area marginally remained constant over the same time. We concluded that changes in land cover in the study area were largely driven by land use change, i.e., increase in cultivation, following the resettlement of people within the Driefontein IBA. It is likely that with increasing human population the natural habitat of the study area will be degraded further, negatively impacting key sensitive habitats such as wetlands, bird species, and other biodiversity. Threats to birds and wetlands habitats are also threats to human livelihoods because people in this semi-arid area depend on wetland ecosystem services for their survival.

In this study the effects of geographic and demographic factors on LULCC are analyzed in northeastern Latvia using official estimates from census and vital statistics data, and using remotely sensed satellite imagery (Landsat Thematic Mapper) acquired from 1992 and 2007. The remote sensing images, elevation data, in-situ ground truth and ground control data (using GPS), census and vital statistics data were processed, integrated, and analyzed in a geographic information system (GIS). Changes in six categories of land-use and land-cover (wetland, water, agriculture, forest, bare field and urban/suburban) were studied to determine their relationship to demographic and geographic factors between 1992 and 2007. Supervised classifications were performed on the Landsat images. Analysis of land cover change based on ""change-to"" categories between the 1992 and 2007 images revealed that changes to forest were the most common type of change (17.1% of pixels), followed by changes to agriculture (8.6%) and the fewest were changes to urban/suburban (0.8%). Integration of population data and land-cover change data revealed key findings: areas near to roads underwent more LULCC and areas far away from Riga underwent less LULCC. Range in elevation was positively correlated with all LULCC categories. Population density was found to be associated with most LULCC categories but the direction of effect was scale dependent.

Future land-use change in the region could have dramatic impacts on ecological resources and processes. A scenario-based modeling framework is needed to support the analysis of potential land-use change in an uncertain future, and to mitigate potentially negative future impacts on ecosystem processes. We developed a scenario-based modeling framework to analyze potential future land-use change in the Great Plains. A unique scenario construction process, using an integrated modeling framework, historical data, workshops, and expert knowledge, was used to develop quantitative demand for future land-use change for four IPCC scenarios at the ecoregion level. The FORE-SCE model ingested the scenario information and produced spatially explicit land-use maps for the region at relatively fine spatial and thematic resolutions. Spatial modeling of the four scenarios provided spatial patterns of land-use change consistent with underlying assumptions and processes associated with each scenario. Economically oriented scenarios were characterized by significant loss of natural land covers and expansion of agricultural and urban land uses. Environmentally oriented scenarios experienced modest declines in natural land covers to slight increases. Model results were assessed for quantity and allocation disagreement between each scenario pair. In conjunction with the U.S. Geological Survey's Biological Carbon Sequestration project, the scenario-based modeling framework used for the Great Plains is now being applied to the entire United States.

A post classification technique was used based on a hybrid classification approach (unsupervised and supervised). Images were classified into six LU/LC types; urban, agriculture, dense forest, open forest-hazelnut, barren land and water area. It is found that significant changes in land cover occurred over the study period. The results showed an increase in urban, open forest/hazelnut, barren land and water area and a decrease in agriculture and dense forest in between 1980 and 1999. In this period, urban land increased from 0.77% to 2.47% of the total area, primarily due to conversions from agricultural land and forest to a lesser degree. While the area of dense forest decreased from 41.09% to 29.64% of the total area, the area of open forest and hazelnut increased from 6.73% to 11.88%.",remote sensing,land use,land cover,image classification,change,landsat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, on the basis of three Chinese LUCC maps from 1988, 2000, and 2008, we examined changes in land-use/land-cover and consequent ESVs using a value transfer method. We found that ESVs decreased by 0.45% and 0.10% during the periods 1988-2000 and 2000-2008, respectively, and that ESV changes in China during the period 2000-2008 were relatively moderate compared to the rest of the world over a similar period.

The changes and dynamics of different land cover classes were investigated using net change analysis and cross-tabulating matrix analysis methods. The net change analysis showed that the most area of Baluchistan is covered by the barren or sparsely vegetated land cover (about 82%) and the shrubland (about 16%) classes. The dynamics analysis of different land cover classes also indicated that there were almost mutually inverse relationships between the different land cover classes in Baluchistan. Such mutual relationships were most common between the following pair classes: shrublands-bare and non-vegetated lands; grasslands-bare and non-vegetated land classes; croplands-bare and non-vegetated lands classes; and shrublands-grasslands. The most unstable land cover classes in this territory were forests, Savannas, and grassland classes.

The CTF is based on texton forest (TF), which is a popular and powerful method in image semantic segmentation due to its effective use of spatial contextual information, its high accuracy, and its fast speed in multiclass classification. The proposed CTF method nonparametrically aggregates a bank of TFs according to HLC information and uses the fact that different types of HLC follow different transition rules. The performance of CTF is compared to support vector machine (SVM), Markov random field (MRF), and a naive TF method which uses historical data directly as a feature channel. On average, CTF results in a 2%-5% higher classification accuracy than other classifiers in our experiment. The classifying speed of CTF is similar with TF, five times faster than MRF, and hundreds of times faster than SVM.

The comparative analyses of land use/land cover from 2001 to 2011 satellite data reveal that significant positive changes have occurred within the watershed under major land use/land cover categories. The transformation of land use from one pattern to another is due to implementation of IWSM programme which has brought unproductive lands under the cropland category by reclaiming wasteland and uncultivated land. The study also confirms the importance of IWSM that is a key to improve the land use/cover of watershed, which contributes to sustainable development besides improving the livelihood of the local community.",Integrated watershed management,Land use/land cover,Remote sensing and GIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data of the AVHRR satellite for the period 1981-2006 were analyzed to understand the type of LULC changes during this period and their linkage with the temperature change over the two regions. The results from OMR indicated that the LULC change over NI during 1981-2006 resulted a warming of 0.03 degrees C, and that of NEI during this period resulted a cooling of 1.5 degrees C. The results from LULC changes during the said period indicated an increase of dry land/snow cover and agriculture/fallow land by similar to 0.1% of total area and a decrease of shrubs/small vegetation and dense forest over NI by about 0.1-0.2%. Over NEI, the areas under agricultural/fallow land, open forest and dense forest showed an increase by about 0.8-2.4% during this period, and the areas under dry/snow cover and shrubs/small vegetation indicated a decrease by similar to 0.7-3.6%. The comparison between the OMR analysis and LULC changes indicated that the warming over NI during 1981-2006 is due to the expansion of the dry land and the decline of dense forest. On the other hand, the cooling over NEI during the period is attributed to the decline of non-vegetated/small vegetated lands and the expansion of agricultural land/forest covers in that period. This study has an overall implication towards the modeling studies for the impact assessment of LULC changes in the present as well as future climate.",land-use and land cover change,climate change,OMR,Northern India,North-Eastern India,,,"Nayak, Hara Prasad","Dutta, Soma",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the knowledge gaps is spatially explicit impact assessment of hydropower dams, especially when it comes down to policies for pay for ecosystem services. In reality, the spatial patterns of dam impacts are obvious, but little is known about the pattern and scope of the impact. Thus, this paper adopted an ellipse shape model in quantifying dam impacts and determined the spatial extents at different dam construction stages. The methods used were the proximity, trend, and cluster analysis on the time-series nighttime lights and enhanced vegetation index, which were then fitted to the ellipse model. The ellipse model was compared to the circular model using three criteria (compactness index, omission index, and ellipse index) to show the usefulness of the ellipse model. The spatial impacts of dams were measured by land use/land cover changes, at different spatial scales and different stage of dams. The results suggested that the ellipse model was able to capture the spatial and temporal effects of dams at different construction stages, when compared with satellite observations. This paper suggested an asymmetric pattern of dam impacts and there were spatial boundaries. These findings may help devising dam-related policies, especially when it relates to pay for ecosystem services.",Dam,Mekong,Ellipse model,Human-environmental interaction,Spatiotemporal impact,Time-series analysis,Land use land cover changes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the Lisbon metropolitan region it is estimated that 17% of natural and farmland have been transformed into artificial areas. Since the end of 1990s, specific EU guidelines have been issued to contain urban sprawl and preserve agricultural land. Spatial planning in Portugal obviously is integrating these assumptions into the statutory land-use master plans. But what is the performance of this land use planning system regarding land cover evolution itself? Based on the Lisbon metropolitan region (LMR), one of the major areas of urban growth in Portugal, we examine spatio-temporal land cover patterns between 1990 and 2007 by integrating cross-matrix analysis, spatial metrics, and gradient analysis. Additionally, we overlay these land cover dynamics with municipal master plans that regulate land development in order to assess the compliance levels of this land-use regulatory system. Results indicate that: artificial areas are growing by coalescence and/or by scattered development along an urban rural gradient; agricultural land is reducing and fragmentation is increasing to enlarge peri-urban spaces; there are high levels of conversion of agricultural land into urban land in protected areas, thus showing a lack of compliance to the land use regulatory system visible in the existing gaps between the original land-use assignments of the master plan and the actual developments.

This study investigates the changes in LULC and its contribution to the change in surface and air temperature in the Lake Tana Basin using data obtained from MODIS remote sensing satellites, ground observation and reanalysis model. Observation minus reanalysis (OMR) method and various analysis tools are used to estimate the impact of LULC changes on temperature. The analysis of LULC change indicates that an increase of Savanna and other type of forest cover by about 519 km2 from year 2001 to year 2020. Wetland increased by about 83.7 km2 during the said period. During the period 2001-2020, about 56.5% baren-land areas are being converted into wetland. The conversion of water bodies and baren land to wetland is likely due to the increase of water hyacinth on both the water body and nearby baren-land whereas the increase in Savanna is linked to an on-going eucalyptus tree plantation. The negative correlation between LST and NDVI (reaching a value of -0.60) is noticed over the Basin throughout the year on inter-annual time scale. An increase in vegetation cover such as Savanna and broad leaf forest coincides with the decreasing LST with an average rate of 0.08%/decade. Also, a reduction in temperature, derived from OMR, at an average cooling rate of about 0.87%/decade is observed in the study period. However, an increase in the LST change rate over built-up and grassland is about 0.03%/decade. Therefore, we conclude that the consistent associations of the increase in areal coverage of the some LULC types with lowest LSTs, 2m-temperature and temperature trend derived from NDVI-LST and LULC-LST associations as well as OMR temperature and LST are unambiguous signatures of the effect of LULC change on temperature over Lake Tana Basin, distinct from that arising due to climate change.",Remote sensing,Land surface temperature,Observed minus reanalysis (OMR),Land use land cover (LULC),MODIS remote sensing image,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analyzing detailed transition process among various land use/land cover types of Chongming Island of Shanghai, China is important to develop strategies for sustainable development and protection of its ecological settings. Accurate land use/land cover information over the past 30 years (1979-2009) was firstly extracted based on Landsat MSS, TM, ETM and ALDS and object-oriented classification. Vegetation, land use/land cover dynamics and the mutual conversions among different land use/land cover classes were analyzed through the calculation of change matrix derived from classified images and application of land use/land cover transfer model. The results showed that the absolute quantity of vegetation change and associated dynamicity were great in terms of the internal conversion among these main land use classes during the different time interval. The decrease of vegetation coverage was significant and the ratio of vegetation cover area to the total area of the island had decreased from 71 % (1979) to 52% (2009) with the expansion of Chongming Island by 358km(2) from 1979 to 2009. The decennial dynamicity during the past 30 years was stable increasing for water body, build-up area and road. The change trend of land use/land cover closely related with requirement of social and economic development in given time besides natural evolution factor.

Land use representation and land use change assessment through remote sensing still remains one of the major challenges for the remote sensing scientific community. In this paper we present a methodological approach based on remote sensing techniques to assess land use in accordance with the requirements of the United Nations Framework Climate Change Convention, UNFCCC (1995). The methodology is based mainly on the recognition of the land key elements and their function and on the adoption of the ""predominant land use"" criteria in the classification scheme settled by rules. The concept that underpins these rules is that the land use function of land can be expressed through hierarchical relationships among key land elements, and that these functional relationships are based on thresholds reflecting the relevance and predominance of key land elements in the observed area. When analyses are supported by high (10-30 m) or very high (<10 m) spatial resolution remote sensing data, the methodology provides a systematic approach for the representation of land use that is consistent with the concepts and methodologies developed by the International Panel on Climate Change(IPCC) to fulfill UNFCCC commitments. In particular, data with high and very high spatial resolution provide good results, with overall accuracies above 87% in the identification of key land elements that characterize land use classes. The methodology could be used to assess land use in any context (e.g., for any land use category or in any country and region) as it is based on the definition of user/project rules that should be tailored on the land use function of any territory.",land cover,land use,key land element,remote sensing,UNFCCC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, quantitative information about coastal land use change is imperative for effective management and planning resources for sustainable development. We analysed the quantitative land use and land cover changes during 1989-2000-2010 periods in three important agroecological zones of the most vulnerable coastal region of Bangladesh using Landsat images (Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus). In the Ganges Tidal Floodplain, the area under shrimp cultivation greatly increased at the rate of 2.05% per annum. The majority of the shrimp area gained from conversion of single cropland. In the Meghna Estuarine Floodplain, decreased mudflat and water bodies were observed, which was predominantly converted into cropland. In Chittagong Coastal Plain, salt pan-shrimp area increased with the expense of single and/or double cropland. In all the study areas, settlement area considerably increased over time. The dynamics of land use change have been attributed to low and unstable food production in the coastal region. The approach adopted in study and the results obtained from the study would likely be useful for policy making and identifying direction for future studies on the coastal land use in Bangladesh.

The land use/land cover (LULC) data sets input into land surface models are used to assign various default parameters from a look-up tables. The objective of this study is to assess the potential uncertainty in the LULC data and to present a reclassification method for improving the accuracy of LULC data sets. The study focuses on the Southern Great Plains and specifically the Walnut River Watershed in southeastern Kansas, USA. The uncertainty analysis is conducted using two data sets: The National Land Cover Dataset 1992 (NLCD 92) and the Gap Analysis Program (GAP) data set, and a reclassification logic tree. A comparison of these data sets showed that they do not agree for approximately 27% of the watershed. Moreover, an accuracy assessment of these two data sets indicated that neither had an overall accuracy as high as 80%. Using the relationships between land-surface characteristics and LULC, a reclassification of the watershed was conducted using a logical model. This model iteratively reclassified the uncertain pixels according to their surface characteristics. The model utilized normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) measurements during April and July 2003, elevation, and slope. The reclassification yielded a revised LULC dataset that was substantially improved. The overall accuracy of the revised data set was nearly 93%. The study results suggest: (i) as models adopt finer grid spacings, the uncertainty in the LULC data will become significant; (ii) assimilating NDVI into the land-surface models can reduce the uncertainty due to LULC assignment; (iii) the standard LULC data sets must be used with caution when the focus is on local scale; and (iv) reclassification is a valuable means of improving the accuracy of LULC data sets prior to applying them to local issues or phenomena.",land use,land cover,land surface modeling,NDVI,land-surface characteristics,surface heterogeneity,,"Chen, Fei","Fall, Souleymane",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most research linking aquatic ecosystems to landscapes has focused on the one-way effect of land on water. However, to understand fully the complex interactions between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, aquatic ecosystems must be seen not only as receptors of human modification of the landscape, but also as potential drivers of these modifications. We hypothesized that the presence of aquatic ecosystems influences the spatial distribution of human land use/cover of the nearby landscape (less than or equal to 1 km) and that this influence has changed through time from the 1930s to the 1990s. To test this hypothesis, we compared the distribution of residential, agricultural, and forested land use/cover around aquatic ecosystems (lakes, wetlands, and streams) to the overall regional land use/cover proportion in an area in southeast Michigan, USA; we also compared the distribution of land use/cover around county roads/highway and towns (known determinants of many land use/cover patterns) to the regional proportion. We found that lakes, wetlands, and streams were strongly associated with the distribution of land use/cover, that each ecosystem type showed different patterns, and that the magnitude of the association was at least as strong as the association with human features. We also found that the area closest to aquatic ecosystems (<500 m) was more strongly associated with land use/cover distribution than areas further away. Finally, we found that the strength of the association between aquatic ecosystems and land use/cover increased from 1938 to 1995, although the overall patterns were similar through time.

Here we provide information on the locations and risk of loss of areas of natural vegetation cover (NVC) on private lands across the northwestern United States to motivate discussion on needs and opportunities to slow their loss. Specific questions were as follows: (1) Where are the remaining areas of NVC on private lands? (2) Which regions and communities have had the highest loss rates of NVC? and (3) In which socioecological settings is NVC at greatest risk of loss? NVC location and change were mapped using two land cover classifications during 2001-2011, the most recent period with available data. Associations between NVC loss and market proximity, demographic, infrastructure, natural amenity, and climate factors were used to model probability of NVC loss in 2011.

Because land cover information synthesizes a rich array of information related to both the ecological condition of land areas and their exploitation by humans, they are widely used for basic and applied research that requires information related to land surface properties (e.g., terrestrial carbon models, water balance models, weather, and climate models) and are core inputs to models and analyses used by natural resource scientists and land managers. As the Earth's global population has grown over the last several decades rates of land cover change have increased dramatically, with enormous impacts on ecosystem services (e.g., biodiversity, water supply, carbon sequestration, etc.). Hence, accurate information related to land cover is essential for both managing natural resources and for understanding society's ecological, biophysical, and resource management footprint. To address the need for high-quality land cover information we are using the global record of Landsat observations to compile annual maps of global land cover from 2001 to 2020 at 30 m spatial resolution. To create these maps we use features derived from time series of Landsat imagery in combination with ancillary geospatial data and a large database of training sites to classify land cover at annual time step. The algorithm that we apply uses temporal segmentation to identify periods with stable land cover that are separated by breakpoints in the time series. Here we provide an overview of the methods and data sets we are using to create global maps of land cover. We describe the algorithms used to create these maps and the core land cover data sets that we are creating through this effort, and we summarize our approach to accuracy assessment.

Bowal (plural bowl) is a particular form of degraded land that occurs in tropical regions and leads to the exposure of ferricretes, which are unsuitable for farming. Bowe are more common on farmland and degraded savanna. Changes in land use/land cover were used to map a region of 6.7 million ha in northern Benin, West Africa in 1975, 1990 and 2010. The changes observed during these periods (1975-1990, 1990-2010 and 1975-2010) were used to predict the occurrence of bowl in the period up to 2050 using Markovian chain analysis. The results showed a considerable change in land use/land cover during the three periods. The types of land on which bowl occur (farmland and degraded savanna) increased in northern Benin by 5.4% per year during the period 1975-1990 and 9.5% per year during the periods 1990-2010, while the natural vegetation (forest, woodland and tree savanna) decreased by the same amount. The future scenarios also predicted the same trend. In the period 1975-1990, 1.28 million ha (26%) of natural vegetation was converted to degraded savanna and farmland while 2.23 million ha (53%) of natural vegetation was converted to degraded savanna and farmland in the period 1990-2010. Based on the dynamics recorded during the period 1975-1990 and 1990-2010 respectively, a total of 1.28 million ha (26% of the natural vegetation that was present in 1975) and 1.29 million ha (31% of the natural vegetation that was present in 1990) will be converted to farmland and degraded savanna in the study area by 2050.Thus bowalization will persist and increase in the period up to 2050. The natural vegetation could disappear if protection and restoration measures are not taken. It is thus important to take measures to stop the degradation and to implement programs to restore soils on bowl based on the soil and water conservation techniques used on highly degraded West African soils, such as sal pit and stone rows with grass strips. Some native plants species adapted to bowalization and resistant to climate change in northern Benin (e.g. Asparagus africtats, Andropogon pseudttpricus and Combretum nigricans) should be used in association with soil and water conservation techniques on bowl.",Land use/land cover change,Natural vegetation,Bowe,Ferricretes,West Africa,,,"Idohou, Rodrigue","Sinsin, Brice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, existing LULC classification methods demonstrate inadequate accuracy, hindering effective regional planning. In this study, we established a two-level LULC classification system (8 primary types and 22 secondary types) for the Tuha Basin. By employing Landsat 5/7/8 imagery at 5-a intervals, we developed the LULC dataset of the Tuha Basin from 1990 to 2020, conducted the accuracy assessment and spatiotemporal evolution analysis, and simulated the future LULC under various scenarios via the Markov-Future Land Use Simulation (Markov-FLUS) model. The results revealed that the average overall accuracy values of our LULC dataset were 0.917 and 0.864 for the primary types and secondary types, respectively. Compared with the seven mainstream LULC products (GlobeLand30, Global 30-meter Land Cover with Fine Classification System (GLC_FCS30), Finer Resolution Observation and Monitoring of Global Land Cover PLUS (FROM_GLC PLUS), ESA Global Land Cover (ESA_LC), Esri Land Cover (ESRI_LC), China Multi-Period Land Use Land Cover Change Remote Sensing Monitoring Dataset (CNLUCC), and China Annual Land Cover Dataset (CLCD)) in 2020, our LULC data exhibited dramatically elevated overall accuracy and provided more precise delineations for land features, thereby yielding high-quality data backups for land resource analyses within the basin. In 2020, unused land (78.0% of the study area) and grassland (18.6%) were the dominant LULC types of the basin; although cropland and construction land constituted less than 1.0% of the total area, they played a vital role in arid land development and primarily situated within oases that form the urban cores of the cities of Turpan and Hami. Between 1990 and 2020, cropland and construction land exhibited a rapid expansion, and the total area of water body decreased yet resurging after 2015 due to an increase in areas of reservoir and pond. In future scenario simulations, significant increases in areas of construction land and cropland are anticipated under the business-as-usual scenario, whereas the wetland area will decrease, suggesting the need for ecological attention under this development pathway. In contrast, the economic development scenario underscores the fast-paced expansion of construction land, primarily from the conversion of unused land, highlighting the significant developmental potential of unused land with a slowing increase in cropland. Special attention should thus be directed toward ecological and cropland protection during development.

Row_222,"Zhang, Z.","Peterson, J.","Zhu, X.",Modelling Land Use and Land Cover Change in the Strzelecki Ranges,,2007,3,"Land use and land cover change (LUCC) has been recognized as an important driver of environmental change on all spatial and temporal scales (Turner et al., 1994). LUCC contributes significantly to earth atmosphere interactions, forest fragmentation, and biodiversity loss. It has become one of the major issues for environmental change monitoring and natural resource management. In Australia, modification of land cover since European settlement has largely been due to land clearing and weed invasion, as well as to some natural disturbances such as bushfire. In the Strzelecki Ranges, located in south eastern Victoria, the wide scale of land clearing, subsequent agricultural abandonment and fires have all resulted in severe landscape disturbance in the Ranges. Land use and land cover have undergone further significant changes with the establishment of large scale plantations in the area over the last four decades. However, details of land use and land cover change and its influence on the rainforest in this area is unknown.The Strzelecki Ranges, along with the southern uplands of the Otways, the Central Highlands, and East Gippsland, are recognised as one of the four major Victorian areas which support cool temperate rainforest ecosystems. Cool temperate rainforest, although now very restricted in its distribution, is of major historical and ecological significance. Areas bordering cool temperate rainforest in the Eastern Strzeleckis comprise a mosaic of different land use patterns and have histories which are affected by both natural and human disturbances. Different land use patterns have different influences on imbedded remnant patches of cool temperate rainforest mainly through edge effects. When the surrounding landscape patterns change, the environmental conditions (e. g. microclimate) produced along these edges (the boundaries between surrounding forests and the cool temperate forest) may be modified and influences the interior cool temperate forest (Murcia, 1995; Bannerman, 1998).This study aims to model the long term land use and land cover changes (from 1954 to 2004) in the Strzelecki Ranges by integrating remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) and to provide quantitative analysis of LUCC information in the area. The reconstructed history of land use and land cover is mainly based on historical aerial photography with the support of Vicmap Elevation, Ecological Vegetation Classes (EVCs) map and stereo models established by using stereo pair of aerial photographs. Available archived historical aerial photographs, taken in 1954, 1972 and 1988, were all scanned and converted to digital format for digital photogrammetric processing. Scanned aerial photos, together with digital colour aerial photos taken in 2004 were used for classification to identify different land covers.The results show that land use and land cover in the study area changed substantially from 1954 to 2004. Large areas of cleared land and forest regrowth on previously cleared land were gradually converted to plantations. Wet forest cover kept increasing during this period, especially from 1954 to 1988. The area covered by cool temperate rainforest has remained relatively stable throughout the period. Large scale plantation, although not equivalent to native forest as wildlife habitat, may improve environmental balances (Lamb, 1998; Loyn, 2000; Cawsey and Freudenberger, 2003; Kanowski et al., 2003; Kanowski et al., 2005; MacHunter et al., 2006; Koskela et al., 2007) and provide refuges for wet forest and surrounded cool temperate rainforest fauna, especially in areas of severe disturbance like that of our study area.",land cover change,GIS,rainforest,landscape dynamic,,,,"Wright, W.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MODSIM 2007: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study employed Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS) using Landsat imagery of 1984, 1995, 2005 and 2015. Image classification for each of these imageries was done through supervised classification using the Maximum Likelihood Classifier. Six major LULC categories, cropland, bare land, shrub land, built-up area, tree savanna and water bodies, were identified in the catchment. It was observed that shrub land and tree savanna were the major LULC categories between 1984 and 2005 while shrub land and cropland dominated the catchment area in 2015. The rates of change were generally faster in the 1995-2005 and 2005-2015 periods.

However, land cover mapping of large areas with medium-resolution imagery is costly and often constrained by the lack of good training and validation data. Our goal was to overcome these limitations, and to test chain classifications, i.e.. the classification of Landsat images based on the information in the overlapping areas of neighboring scenes. The basic idea was to classify one Landsat scene first where good ground truth data is available, and then to classify the neighboring Landsat scene using the land cover classification of the first scene in the overlap area as training data. We tested chain classification for a forest/non-forest classification in the Carpathian Mountains on one horizontal chain of six Landsat scenes, and two vertical chains of two Landsat scenes each. We collected extensive training data from Quickbird imagery for classifying radiometrically uncorrected data with Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The SVMs classified 8 scenes with overall accuracies between 92.1% and 98.9% (average of 96.3%). Accuracy loss when automatically classifying neighboring scenes with chain classification was 1.9% on average. Even a chain of six images resulted only in an accuracy loss of 5.1% for the last image compared to a reference classification from independent training data for the last image. Chain classification thus performed well, but we note that chain classification can only be applied when land cover classes are well represented in the overlap area of neighboring Landsat scenes. As long as this constraint is met though, chain classification is a powerful approach for large area land cover classifications, especially in areas of varying training data availability.

The LULC map of the study area was produced using the supervised classification method with the maximum likelihood algorithm. Our study results revealed that agricultural land was increased by the rate of 30.4 km(2)/year.

Simple equation methods predict runoff and pollutant loads using runoff coefficients or pollutant export coefficients that are often correlated to LULC type. Complex models use input variables and parameters to represent watershed characteristics, and pollutant buildup and washoff rates as a function of LULC type. Whether using simple or complex models an accurate LULC dataset with an appropriate spatial resolution and level of detail is paramount for reliable predictions. The study presented in this paper compared and evaluated several LULC dataset sources for application in urban environmental modeling. The commonly used USGS LULC datasets have coarser spatial resolution and lower levels of classification than other LULC datasets. In addition, the USGS datasets do not accurately represent the land use in areas that have undergone significant land use change during the past two decades.

Understanding how land development influences stormwater runoff is essential for sustainably managing water resources. In recent years, aggregate low impact development-best management practices (LID-BMPs) have been implemented to reduce the negative impacts of stormwater runoff on receiving water bodies. This study used an integrated approach to determine the influence of land development and assess the ecological benefits of four aggregate LID-BMPs in stormwater runoff from a mixed land use and land cover (LULC) catchment with ongoing land development. It used data from 2011 to 2015 that monitored 41 storm events and monthly LULC, and a Personalized Computer Storm Water Management Model (PCSWMM). The four aggregate LID-BMPs are: ecological (S1), utilizing pervious covers (S2), and multi-control (S3) and (S4). These LID-BMPs were designed and distributed in the study area based on catchment characteristics, cost, and effectiveness. PCSWMM was used to simulate the monitored storm events from 2014 (calibration: R-2 and NSE > 0.5; RMSE <11) and 2015 (validation: R2 and NSE > 0.5; RMSE <12). For continuous simulation and analyzing LID-BMPs scenarios, the five-year (2011 to 2015) stormwater runoff data and LULC change patterns (only 2015 for LID-BMPs) were used. Results show that the expansion of bare land and impervious cover, soil alteration, and high amount of precipitation influenced the stormwater runoff variability during different phases of land development. The four aggregate LID-BMPs reduced runoff volume (34%61%), peak flow (6%-19%), and pollutant concentrations (53%-83%). The results of this study, in addition to supporting local LULC planning and land development activities, also could be applied to input data for empirical modeling, and designing sustainable stormwater management guidelines and monitoring strategies.

The present study aims to analyze the LST variations in response to land-use and land-cover (LULC) dynamics in the case of Didessa River Sub-basin, Western Ethiopia using geospatial techniques. We used Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (1991), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (2003), Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS, 2020). Moreover, meteorological data (1991-2020) of seven stations, namely, Sire, Nekemte, Arjo, Limu Genet, Atnago, Agaro, and Yayu, were obtained from National Meteorological Agency to validate the LST with air temperature. Our results reveal that the cultivated land in the study area increased by 1180 km(2) (22.5%), while grassland and forest cover were declined by 828.7 km(2) (15.8%) and 444.1 km(2) (8.5%), respectively over the past 29 years. These land-cover dynamics contributes for the increasing trend of LST in the study area. The study also analyzed relationship of LST with normalized differences in vegetation index and air temperature. Maximum-likelihood classification methods were used for LULC classification, while the LST data were retrieved from Landsat image. The results indicate that the LST has been increasing since 1991 in reaction to LULC dynamics. Within the sub-basin, high LST values were recorded on bare land and settlement land use followed by cultivated land cover, while forest and water body experienced the lowest LST. This study will contribute in understanding of impact of LULC dynamics on the local climate and would further provide assistance to the policy makers in regard to land-use planning and climate change mitigation strategies.",Land surface temperature,Land use,land cover,Normalized Difference Vegetation Index,Didessa sub-basin,,,"Ahmed, Zia","Gemeda, Dessalegn Obsi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the impacts of LUCC (Land Use and Land Cover Change) on LST in Laizou Bay plain in different years. The results showed that land use types of culturing water increased significantly, correspondingly the area of grass land and salt land have a substantial reduction, and that of urban and rural settlements increased considerably. We retrieved the land surface temperature of two years using the method of Qin Zhihao's mono-windows algorithm. Then we analyzed the temperature change on different kinds of land use.

In doing so, SLEUTH was applied to design a better plan for future and assess two scenarios concerning land-use and land-cover changes in Gorgan Township of the Golestan Province of Iran. Four land-use and land-cover maps were derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus imagery through a hybrid method including unsupervised, supervised, and on-screen classification for four years. To provide a more desirable forecast of future land-use and land-cover changes, SLEUTH's exclusion layer was combined with an urbanization-suitability layer from a multicriteria evaluation (MCE) using fifteen map layers that most influence land suitability for urban development. The layers used in the MCE process were related to landform, vegetation, soil and geology, and surrogate socioeconomic factors; hence, they portrayed the desirability of the urban growth. SLEUTH was used for forecasting with both this new and a standard exclusion layer. Using the new layer, the fragmentation of the future land-use pattern was controlled and urban development along roads was restrained, thereby safeguarding the remaining urban green space and remnant rural vegetation patches. The results were also compared with a separate site selection process for future urban development showing the desirability of MCE-guided SLEUTH modeling over original SLEUTH and the standalone urban MCE in terms of landform, surrogate socioeconomic factors, and landscape metrics such as patch size, shape, and proximity and fractal dimension. As SLEUTH derives change rules simultaneously for different land-use and land-cover types in a self-modifying self-organizing manner, we showed the approach can be regarded as a tool for dynamic land-use planning.",SLEUTH,Gorgan,multicriteria evaluation,urbanization,land-use planning,sustainable land use,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Project methodology included incorporating information collected from a combination of semiformal, key informant, and formal household interviews with the development of spatial data-bases based on aerial photographs, satellite images, topographic maps, and GPS data. Results suggest that land use (e.g. swidden cultivation) and land cover (e.g. secondary vegetation) have remained stable and the minor amount of land-use change that has occurred has been a change from swidden to monocultural cash crops. Results suggest that two forces will increasingly determine land-use systems in this region. First, national land tenure policies-the nationalization of forest lands and efforts to increase control over upland resources by central governments-will provide a push factor making it increasingly difficult for farmers to maintain their traditional swidden land-use practices. Second, market pressures-the commercialization of subsistence resources and the substitution of commercial crops for subsistence crops-will provide a pull factor encouraging farmers to engage in new and different forms of commercial agriculture. These results appear to be robust as they come from eight studies conducted over the last decade. But important questions remain in terms of what research protocols are needed, if any, when linking social science data with remotely sensed data for understanding human-environment interactions.",land-use/land-cover change,GIS,remote sensing,social science data,Southeast Asia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies investigated mainly the basic socioeconomic drivers of LULCC. However, these studies less considered climate change vulnerability as a potential driver. Hence, this study is aimed to assess LULCC drivers in more fragile and dynamic landscapes of the East African Rift Valley region for the period of 1986-2016. We used a combination of Remote Sensing, Geographic Information System, logistic regression, and descriptive statistics to quantify and analyze the data. Image analysis results indicated that during the overall study period (1986-2016), grass/ grazing land, agricultural land, and bare land have increased by 124%, 42%, and 34% respectively, whereas scattered acacia woodland, bush/shrubland, and swampy/marshy land have declined by 52%, 50%, and 31%, in that order. This image-derived change trend is in line with farmers' perceived results. The top most influential drivers of LULCC includes population growth (95%), fuel wood extraction (93%), agricultural land expansion (92%), charcoal making (92%), climate change/recurrent drought (79%), and overgrazing (71%) in descending order of percentage of respondents. Education level and age of farmers significantly (p<0.05) affected their perception towards less perceived drivers.

Hence, land use and land cover changes in surrounding areas may substantially influence the natural resources within parks. The US National Park Service has recognized these threats and incorporated land use and land cover monitoring into its Inventory and Monitoring Program. The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework based on a conceptual approach for planning and implementing monitoring within this Program. We present a conceptual model, based on ecological theory, which illustrates how land use and land cover change impact park resources, and helps to identify monitoring indicators that will measure relevant attributes of land use and land cover change. We also discuss potential sources of data for quantifying indicators of land use and land cover change over time, including remote sensing data and ancillary spatial datasets. Finally, we describe steps for analyzing monitoring data so that the intensity and direction of changes in land use and land cover over time are quantified, as well as trends in the status of important park resources impacted by these changes. Integration of land use and land cover monitoring data and park resource data will allow for analysis of change from past to present, and can be used to project trends into the future to provide knowledge about potential land use and land cover change scenarios and ecological impacts.

Analysis of temperature, rainfall and aridity index (ratio of rainfall to reference evapotranspiration) data during 1941-2009 shows significant warming of the climate, increasing rainfall variability and seasonality, and intensifying aridity conditions during the start and end of the wet season. The somewhat recent enhancement of the overall (annual) rainfall has reflected only in the mid wet season and were caused by few very wet days, indicating increased rainfall concentration and possible risk of soil erosion. Such climatic alterations and variability have inherent implications for land-use and land-cover over the region. LULC changes were investigated using multi-temporal satellite imagery from three sites along the livestock routes. The major trends were drastic conversions of natural vegetation areas into large-scale mechanized agricultural land. This resulted in a progressive loss and degradation of grazing area in the entire region. Overall, the documented LULC changes may cause an irreversible loss of biodiversity and a depletion of other ecological services provided by natural vegetation. The results of this study provide useful information when seeking to resolve complex land-management issues. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there are concerted efforts by government departments and NGO's to bring back the degraded forests to original position through plantation and related agro-forestry activities. Reforestation/afforestation is often recommended as a means of reducing the increased surface water losses associated with soil degradation, returning water to the roots through the soil profile, thereby ultimately restoring base flow. Most of the rehabilitation programs often adopt fast-growing exotic species such as, Eucalyptus spp., Acacia auriculiformis. Many researchers raised concerns over the increased afforestation with exotic forest species on water availability. However, such studies are quite sparse, particularly in humid tropical climates. The Western Ghats in south India, is a treasure house for number of rivers which feeds locally and plays a significant role in socio-economic growth of this part of the country. It is reported that, there is a tremendous change in land use/land cover mainly because of deforestation and also due to afforestation with exotic species such as A. auriculiformis.

Taking advantages of the land use/cover change monitoring platform (FROM-GLC Plus), this study developed the annual land use/cover maps during 2000-2022, and the land use/cover change, especially the change of grassland, was further analyzed. The grassland area exhibited a net increase, predominantly transformed from cropland, forest, and bareland, accounting for 17.64 %, 31.91 %, and 45.60 %, respectively. To monitor land degradation, we adopted the framework suggested by the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). According to the monitoring result, grassland constituted the highest proportion of degraded land (39.82 %). This may due to its dominance in the Eurasian steppe's land use/cover, as the extent of grassland degradation (1.92 %) was lower than the overall land degradation level (2.83 %) across the region. To offer tailored and sustainable development recommendations, we quantified the driving factors behind land dynamics using the geographical detector model and convergent cross mapping (CCM), considering both spatial and temporal dimensions. Environmental and socio-economic factors, such as precipitation, temperature, urbanization, mining and grazing intensity, etc., were integrated into the analysis. We found that urbanization, cropland and moisture distribution emerged as key drivers influencing land degradation's spatial distribution in the Eurasian steppe, while temperature variations between years impacted vegetation changes. This research thus provides a deeper understanding of the region's land dynamics, enhancing comprehensive monitoring of the Eurasian steppe's land dynamics.

Characterizing its impact on ecosystem carbon storage is critical to balance regional carbon budgets and make land use decisions. However, due to the availability of LULC data and the strong variability in LULC change, uncertainty remains high in quantifying the effect of LULC change on the historical and future carbon stock. Based on four historical LULC maps and one future LULC projection, this study combined the Land Use and Carbon Scenario Simulator (LUCAS) with a process-based CENTURY model to evaluate the historical and future LULC change and its impact on grassland carbon storage from 1991 to 2050 in northern China. Results showed that grassland experienced a drastic decrease of 16.10 x 10(3) km(2) before 2005, while agriculture and barren land increased by 16.91 x 10(3) km(2) and 3.73 x 10(3) km(2), respectively. After that, grassland was projected to increase, agriculture kept steady, and barren land decreased. LULC change has resulted in enormous total ecosystem carbon loss, mainly in agro-pasture areas; the maximum 8.54% of carbon loss happened in 2000, which was primarily attributed to agriculture to grassland, forest to grassland, grassland to agriculture, and grassland to barren. Before 2000, the grassland net biome productivity was projected to be -15.54 Tg C/yr and -2.69 Tg C/yr with and without LULC change. After 2001, the LULC change showed a positive impact on the grassland carbon balance, and the region was projected to be a carbon sink.

Images of three different years (2008, 2011 and 2014) taken from Landsat and other three satellites (GF-1, HJ-1 and SPOT) were used to monitor the land use and land cover changes in this study. Landsat images were used as the main references for analysis while the others were used associative for some enhancement. In order to increase the accuracy of the results, we abandon the single resolution image and use different spatial and spectral resolution images simultaneously in the classification and other processing stage. Three different methods to determine the changes of land use and land cover have been used in this paper: transfer matrix of land use, changes related to the terrain of earth surface and landscape pattern of composition changes. Thematic maps have been prepared showing the land use and land cover classes in individual year as well as the changes during different time interval to identify the spatial changes. Changes related to the terrain have been statistics using classified images and digital elevation model (DEM). Quantitative analysis of each phase of the land use and land cover pattern characteristics using part of the landscape pattern indexes. The result of the study illustrates that: 1) the area of built-up and cultivated have the rapid and continuous growth and the area of vegetation descended. And the new construction land mainly by agricultural land conversion, the forest area reduced mainly converted to the agricultural land; 2) vegetation and agricultural land change mainly concentrated in the 500 meters below, have slight change in in 1000 to 1500 meters and no significant changes in other altitude; 3) From patch density(PD) and other landscape metrics analysis result, built up area is increasing not only in amount but also in number of patches, that is, the new built up areas area being established frequently.

Landsat images for 1988, 2002, and 2018 were processed, classified and analysed. The accuracy assessment showed that the classification was relatively acceptable and effective in detecting the long-term land-use changes in ARB. Cropland increased by 12% between 1988 and 2002, and by 2018 it had increased by 15%. Similarly, the built-up area expanded by 52 km(2) (184%) between 1988 and 2002, and by 2018 it had reached 225%. The analysis showed that the cropland and built-up area expanded at the expense of forest and shrubland, with shrubland and forest reducing by 4% and 25% respectively over the 30 year study period. Higher levels of deforestation, combined with population growth, urbanization and cropland expansion, have impacted on the available water resources and runoff in the area. The findings from this study can help in the design of sustainable environmental management strategies and practices to ensure the sustainability of the ecosystem and natural resources. The results can also be used to address food security issues in the ARB since we see an increasing trend in population growth with a commensurate decrease in agricultural land, thereby increasing food security concerns.",Land-use/land-cover,Dynamics,Cropland,Forest,Population,,,"Kogo, Benjamin K.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Landsat series TM, ETM+, and OLI satellite imageries of Ibadan region city for 1984, 2002, and 2019, respectively, were obtained from the US Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat series of Earth Observation satellites accessible on the Google earth engine (GEE) platform. Supervised classification was done using a random forest (RF) machine learning classifier in the GEE platform. Surface emissivity maps were obtained from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) thresholds method and land cover information. The surface emissivity based on NDVI classes was used to retrieve land surface temperature (LST). The results showed an increase in urban cover from 341.72 km(2) in 1984 to 520.58 km(2) in 2019 with an average increase in land surface temperature from 17 degrees C to 38 degrees C, respectively.

It dissipates to about 19 degrees C at the suburb that is less built up. A significant negative relationship exists between the health condition of vegetation (NDVI) and LST with a correlation coefficient of r = - 0.95. The study confirms the potential application of GIS and remote sensing for detecting urban growth as well as relates growth impact to LST, thereby suggesting that fitting strategies will be important for the sustainable management of the urban areas.",Land surface temperature,Land use,land cover,Urban heat island,NDVI,Random forest,Google earth engine,"Oluseyi Obateru, Rotimi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is capable of detecting many kinds of land cover change continuously as new images are collected and providing land cover maps for any given time. A two-step cloud, cloud shadow, and snow masking algorithm is used for eliminating ""noisy"" observations. A time series model that has components of seasonality, trend, and break estimates surface reflectance and brightness temperature. The time series model is updated dynamically with newly acquired observations. Due to the differences in spectral response for various kinds of land cover change, the CCDC algorithm uses a threshold derived from all seven Landsat bands. When the difference between observed and predicted images exceeds a threshold three consecutive times, a pixel is identified as land surface change. Land cover classification is done after change detection. Coefficients from the time series models and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from model estimation are used as input to the Random Forest Classifier (RFC). We applied the CCDC algorithm to one Landsat scene in New England (WRS Path 12 and Row 31). All available (a total of 519) Landsat images acquired between 1982 and 2011 were used. A random stratified sample design was used for assessing the change detection accuracy, with 250 pixels selected within areas of persistent land cover and 250 pixels selected within areas of change identified by the CCDC algorithm. The accuracy assessment shows that CCDC results were accurate for detecting land surface change, with producer's accuracy of 98% and user's accuracies of 86% in the spatial domain and temporal accuracy of 80%. Land cover reference data were used as the basis for assessing the accuracy of the land cover classification.

The second category uses fine spatial resolution data to classify different land surface. With the launch of Chinese satellite constellation HJ-1in 2008, four 30 m spatial resolution CCDs with about 360 km coverage for each one onboard two satellites made a revisit period of two days, which brought a new type of data with both high spatial resolution and high temporal frequency. Therefore, by taking the spatiotemporal advantage of HJ-1/CCD data we propose a new method for finer resolution land cover mapping using the time series HJ-1/CCD data, which can greatly improve the land cover mapping accuracy.

In this study, first, land use/land cover change was simulated with CLUE-S model under three scenarios for 2050. Then, morphological fragmentation and disorder degree of agricultural lands were analyzed using land use/land cover change maps (1990 and 2014), simulation results (2050) and 1/25,000 Tekirdag Provincial Environmental Plan (2023). Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis and entropy methods were used to determine the spatiotemporal fragmentation degree in agricultural lands. Results of scenarios 1 and 2 demonstrate that urban areas will increase due to population growth, and increasing urban and industrial land sprawl will accelerate the decline and fragmentation of agricultural lands until 2050. However, loss and fragmentation of core agricultural lands for scenario 3 where the protection rules are applied will be less than scenarios 1 and 2. To mitigate further fragmentation in agricultural lands in the future, particularly artificial spatial development areas should be constructed on the zones with currently high entropy and fragmented small core pieces.

Analysis on four periods of remote sensing image showed that there was a wide change in land use and land cover of Manas River Basin in recent 30 years. Natural grassland decreased with a rate of 91.426km(2)/a and cultivated land increase with a rate of 121.383km(2)/a. The rapid expansion of cultivated land converted mainly by reclamations of wasteland and natural grassland. And there were little changes of other land use types. From the relationship of transformation between various types of land use and land cover, it could be found that unused land is relatively stable land-use types, the areas of residential land and industrial land increased gradually and the cultivated land and natural grassland were the main source, a larger proportion of natural grassland mainly changed into cultivated land, forest land and residential land and industrial land, land changed into cultivated land was larger than cultivated land changed into the other land and the increased land main converted by natural grassland, and the forest land converted to other land increased gradually and the they mainly converted to salt and kaline land.

The model was developed and tested on a dataset containing land cover information and environmental data, in order to show that decisions about which datasets should be used Could be made automatically. Bayesian networks are amenable to evolutionary methods as they can be easily described using a binary string to which crossover and mutation operations can be applied. The method, developed to allow comparison with standard Bayesian network development software, was proved capable of carrying out a rapid and effective search of the space of possible networks in order to find an optimal or near-optimal solution for the selection of datasets that have causal links with one another.

This study assessed the impact from LULC changes to soil erosion. LULC change maps were analyzed based on Landsat satellite imagery of 1998, 2008, and 2018, computed in QGIS 6.2.9, while the soil erosion loss was estimated by the integration of remote sensing, GIS tools, and Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model. The results showed that the area of agricultural land of Battambang province significantly increased from 44.50% in 1998 to 61.11% in 2008 and 68.40% in 2018. The forest cover significantly decreased from 29.82% in 1998 to 6.18% in 2018. Various soil erosion factors were estimated using LULC and slope. Based on that, the mean soil loss was 2.92 t/ha.yr in 1998, 4.20 t/ha.yr in 2008, and 4.98 t/ha.yr in 2018. Whereas the total annual soil loss was 3.49 million tons in 1998, 5.03 million tons in 2008, and 5.93 million tons in 2018. The annual soil loss at the agricultural land dramatically increased from 190,9347.9 tons (54%) in 1998 to 3,543,659 tons (70.43%) in 2008 and to 4,267,439 tons (71.91%) in 2018 due to agricultural land expansion and agricultural practices. These losses were directly correlated with LULC, especially agricultural land expansion and forest cover decline. Our results highlight the need to develop appropriate land use and crop management practices to decrease land degradation and soil erosion. These data are useful to bring about public awareness of land degradation and alert local citizens, researchers, policy makers, and actors towards land rehabilitation to bring the area of land back to a state which is safe for increasing biodiversity and agricultural productivity.

The remotely sensed dynamic monitoring of Land use/land cover (LULC) in rapidly developing city regions has increasingly depended on remote-sensing data at high temporal and spatial resolutions. However, due to the influence of revisiting periods and weather, it is difficult to acquire enough time-series images with high quality at both high temporal and spatial resolution from the same sensor. In this paper we used the temporal-spatial fusion model ESTARFM (Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model) to blend Landsat8 and MODIS data and obtain time-series Landsat8 images. Then, land cover information is extracted using an object-based classification method. In this study, the proposed method is validated by a case study of the Changsha City. The results show that the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient were 94.38% and 0.88, respectively, and the user/producer accuracies of vegetation types were all over 85%.

This article presents a comprehensive land use and land cover change (LULCC) analysis of two adjacent upland borderland districts, Phong Tho and Bat Xat, in northern Vietnam, spanning two neighboring inland provinces, Lai Chau and Lao Cai. These districts are primarily home to ethnic minority farmers who are encouraged by Vietnamese state officials to not only protect forests but to also transition toward cash crop cultivation from less intensive semi-subsistence agriculture. Our LULCC maps, covering the period from 1990 to 2020, revealed a reduction in the speed by which closed-canopy forests were disappearing. During interviews, state officials were confident that this was due to a range of state policies and state-sponsored initiatives, including the promotion of tree crops and payments for forest environmental services. Our own fieldwork in the region suggests other factors are also supporting this decline in deforestation rates, rooted in ethnic minority farmer livelihood decision making. Some state officials were also able to point to factors hindering a more positive result regarding forest cover, including population pressure and new infrastructure. Interestingly, despite our positive findings on Land use and land cover change (LULCC) related to forest cover, one-third of state officials, upon reviewing our LULCC maps, firmly maintained that errors had occurred. Some even proposed that there was an actual rise in forest cover. Our study shows that these discrepancies raise compelling questions about officials' political motivations and ongoing pressures to uphold the central state's reforestation and agrarian transition discourses.",land use land cover change (LULCC),forest cover,Vietnam,ethnic minorities,livelihoods,,,"Kalacska, Margaret","Turner, Sarah",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, various spatial analyses require to grid thematic maps into smaller regular geometric grids such as square and triangle, where the attribute of the dominant land cover/use class is assigned as the grid value. Hence, the class is represented geometrically via the selected gridding system and the accuracy of the later intended spatial analysis is altered. Moreover, the grid size that provide acceptable errors within determined thresholds for each grid is also utmost importance, since it is necessary to represent the original land cover/use thematic, to reduce the complexity and computing time of the analysis. Both of these problems remained unsolved especially for the green classes such as vegetation, forest etc. This study proposes a methodology to identify the best suitable gridding system for green areas, where the relationship of scale for each gridding system is analyzed. The study grids a reference land cover/use map, where both square and triangle systems at 23 different scales are tested. The relative errors of each gridding system at each scale are found via comparing the areal results of each grid with the reference map. According to the achieved results, the triangle gridding system is identified as more accurate in providing areal representation. Furthermore, the developed model demonstrates the associated errors of each scale for both gridding systems. Thus, the developed model could be utilized to choose appropriate grid cell size according to the application.",Land cover,land use,gridding,square,triangle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To recognize the complex distribution of urban features in high-resolution image data, texture information consisting of a group of pixels should be considered. Lacunarity is an index used to characterize different texture appearances. It is often reported that the land-use and land-cover in urban areas can be effectively classified using the lacunarity index with high-resolution images. However, the applicability of the maximum-likelihood approach for hybrid analysis has not been reported. A more effective approach that employs the original spectral data and lacunarity index can be expected to improve the accuracy of the classification. A new classification procedure referred to as ""gradable classification method"" is proposed in this study. This method improves the classification accuracy in incremental steps. The proposed classification approach integrates several classification maps created from original images and lacunarity maps, which consist of lacnarity values, to create a new classification map. The results of this study confirm the suitability of the gradable classification approach, which produced a higher overall accuracy (68%) and kappa coefficient (0.64) than those (65% and 0.60, respectively) obtained with the maximum-likelihood approach.",lacunarity,land-use and land-cover classification,gradable classification,aerial photograph,maximum-likelihood classification,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Landsat imageries downloaded from the United States Geological Survey archives were used to assess land use-land cover changes between 1973 and 2019 by applying supervised classification using Arc GIS 10.5. The IDRISI Selva 17.0 was used to calculate area under different land uses and generate change maps. The major Land Use-Land Cover (LULC) classified were mixed farming, natural forests, planted forests, bamboo forest, fallow land, tea plantation. The landsat images had an average overall classification accuracy of 87.12% and kappa coefficient (K) of 0.84. The kappa coefficient was rated as substantial and the classified images qualified for further analysis. Results established that there was an 18% decline in the natural forest cover between 1977 and 2019. There was a similar decline of 15.19% in bamboo forest cover. Plantation forests established in the 1990's also showed a 15.6% decline between 1999 and 2019.

The impact assessment analyzed multi-temporal changes in the upstream land use/land cover characteristics of the wetland watershed using remote sensing data of Landsat MSS/TM. The multi-temporal land use/land cover statistics revealed that significant changes have taken place in the Wuyuer River Basin. In response to these upstream land use/cover changes, the marsh landscape in Zhalong wetland has showed changes in spatial extension, landscape pattern, and water quality characteristics. The major impacts have resulted from construction of a reservoir and water diversion engineering that has altered the wetland hydrological conditions and reduced the spatial distribution of the marsh landscape. In addition, inputs of agricultural nutrients, and industrial and human wastes from the upper catchments have resulted in increased signs of eutrophication. This study suggests that effective wetland hydrological restoration measures are needed to avoid further deterioration of this internationally important ecosystem.",Land use/Land cover,Dynamics,Wetland ecosystem,Zhalong wetland,,,,"Cui, J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have reported the climate effects of global deforestation, vegetation greening and crop cultivation changes. However, the contribution of each type of land state, land transition and land management to LULCC's climate effects remain underexamined. In this study, we estimated global biophysical temperature effects of LULCC using CMIP6 climate models, with special attention on the relative contribution (RC) of 12 land state changes, 113 land transitions and 10 land managements. The results show a large difference in the simulated LULCC's temperature effect between CESM2 and UKESM1-0-LL, and the two models even disagree in the sign of LULCC's effects in most of northern hemisphere except for autumn. Based on the weighted mean of two models, we found that historical LULCC has exerted a global warming effect at a rate of 0.0025 degrees C/century, with the largest warming effect in autumn. Spatially, a significant (p < 0.05) cooling effect is found from 60 degrees N to 40 degrees N, while the warming trend dominates the areas from 40 degrees N to 30 degrees S. Based on regression modelling, historical changes in forested/non-forested secondary land, urban land and cropland have contributed over 70% to LULCC's temperature effect, with land transitions from secondary land to cropland and from cropland to urban land dominating the climate effect at global scale. For land management, the climate effect of irrigation is larger than that of nitrogen fertilizer application. Furthermore, the application of nitrogen fertilizer for C3 plant has larger impacts compared to C4 plants, while similar effects of irrigation are observed for different types of croplands. Besides, the large difference in temperature effect between CESM2 and UKESM1-0-LL may be the difference in the forestland and cropland changes. Our study calls for explicit ex-amination of the climate effect induced by different types of land state-change, land transition and land man-agement for developing targeted land use policies in the future.",Land cover,use change,Climate effect,Land state change,Land transition,Land management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used projections of land use (four variables), land cover (five variables), and climate (nine variables) to assess changes for 707 wilderness areas in the contiguous United States by mid-21st century under two scenarios (medium-low and high). We ranked all wilderness areas relative to each other by summing and ranking decile values for each land use, land cover, and climate variable and calculating a multivariate metric of future change. All wilderness areas were projected to experience some level of change by mid-century. The greatest land-use changes were associated with increases in agriculture, clear cutting, and developed land, while the greatest land cover changes were observed for grassland, forest, and shrubland.

In this study, Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Tirupati, A.P., India, is considered as a study area to explain the Land use/land cover (LULC) classification, Land Surface Temperature (LST), and the inverse correlation between LST and the NDVI of Temporal Landsat satellite images at intervals of 5 years from 2000 to 2020. We performed easy and thoroughgoing classifications based on vegetation phenology, using an extended LULC field database, a time series of LANDSAT satellite imagery, and a pixel-based classifier. In total, five land-use and land-cover types have been identified: dense vegetation, vegetation, built-up, barren land, and water. Over the period of inquiry, there were notable increases in the area of built-up land, dense vegetation, and vegetation, whereas there was a marked decrease in water bodies and barren land. The diverse effects of land transformation on the natural environment have been assessed using Land Surface Temperature (LST) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The used technique achieved very good levels of accuracy (90-97%) and a strong kappa coefficient (0.89-0.96), with low commission and omission errors. The variation of the land surface temperature was studied using the Mono-Window algorithm. Change detection, and the transition of the natural land cover to man-made land use, were statistically computed for the study area. Results exposed that there had been significant variations in the land use and cover during the tagged eras. In general, two land use and land cover change patterns were confirmed in the study zone: (i) compatible growth of the zone in built-up areas, barren land, plantations, and shrubs; and (ii) continual diminishment in agriculture and water; maximum urban development took place between 2000 to 2020.

The LUCAS (Land Use Cover Area frame Sample) survey is one of the few authoritative in situ field campaigns, which takes place every three years in European Union member countries. More recently, a study has considered whether citizen science and crowdsourcing could complement LUCAS survey data, e.g., through the FotoQuest Austria mobile app and crowdsourcing campaign. Although the data obtained from the campaign were promising when compared with authoritative LUCAS survey data, there were classes that were not well classified by the citizens. Moreover, the photographs submitted through the app were not always of sufficient quality. For these reasons, in the latest FotoQuest Go Europe 2018 campaign, several improvements were made to the app to facilitate interaction with the citizens contributing and to improve their accuracy in LULC identification. In addition to extending the locations from Austria to Europe, a change detection component (comparing land cover in 2018 to the 2015 LUCAS photographs) was added, as well as an improved LC decision tree. Furthermore, a near real-time quality assurance system was implemented to provide feedback on the distance to the target location, the LULC classes chosen and the quality of the photographs. Another modification was a monetary incentive scheme in which users received between 1 to 3 Euros for each successfully completed quest of sufficient quality. The purpose of this paper is to determine whether citizens can provide high quality in situ data on LULC through crowdsourcing that can complement LUCAS. We compared the results between the FotoQuest campaigns in 2015 and 2018 and found a significant improvement in 2018, i.e., a much higher match of LC between FotoQuest Go Europe and LUCAS.

Melbourne has been the subject of previous studies of land cover change but often over short time periods without considering the trade-offs between land use/land cover (LULC) and mean daytimes summer season LST over a more extended period. To fill this gap, this research aims to investigate the role of LULC change on mean annual daytime LST in the hot summers of 2001 and 2018 in Melbourne. To achieve the study's aim, LULC and LST maps were generated based on the cost-effective cloud-based geospatial analysis platform Google Earth Engine (GEE). Furthermore, the geospatial and geo-statistical relationship between LULC, LST, and spectral indices of LULC, including the Normalised Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) and the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), were identified. The findings showed that the mean daytime LST increased by 5.1 degrees C from 2001 to 2018. The minimum and maximum LST values were recorded for the vegetation and the built-up area classes for 2001 and 2018. Additionally, the mean daytime LST for vegetation and the built-up area classes increased by 5.5 degrees C and 5.9 degrees C from 2001 to 2018, respectively.

Furthermore, we simulated LULC using the integrated approaches of Cellular Automata (CA) and Weighted Evidence (WE) and used a regression model to predict LST. The built-up areas and vegetation have increased by 2.1% and 11% due to a decline in the barren land by -8.5% during the last 30 years. The LULC is expected to increase, particularly the built-up and vegetation classes by 2.74% and 13.66%, respectively, and the barren land would decline by -4.2% by 2047. Consequently, the higher LST classes (i.e., 27 degrees C to <30 degrees C and >= 30 degrees C) soared up by about 25.18% and 34.26%, respectively, during the study period, which would further expand to 30.19% and 14.97% by 2047. The lower LST class (i.e., 12 degrees C to <21 degrees C) indicated a downtrend of about -41.29% and would further decrease to -3.13% in the next 30 years. The study findings are useful for planning and management, especially for climatologists, land-use planners, and researchers in sustainable land use with rapid urbanization.",land-use,land cover,land surface temperature,simulation,sustainable land-use planning,,,"Khan, Muhammad Sadiq","Ullah, Siddique","Ahmad, Khalid","Rehman, Nazir Ur",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The data were captured using a digital camera, Kodak DC 290 from a small light aircraft at 8000 feet altitude. This overcomes the problem of difficulty in obtaining cloud-free satellite images especially in the equatorial region where experience showed that just two or three cloud-free scenes per year could be obtained The use of digital camera as a sensor to capture digital images is cheaper and economical compared to the use of other airborne sensor. The images consisted of the three visible bands-red, green and blue. Three supervised classifications techniques (maximum likelihood, minimum distance-to-mean and parallelepiped) were performed to the digital image. The training sites were established using polygons within each scene and four land cover classes were assigned to each classifier. The relative performance of the techniques was evaluated The accuracy of the classified images was validated using a reference data set. The results produced high degree of accuracy. Finally, geometric correction was performed to the digital image using the nearest neighborhood method with second order polynomial to produce geocoded map. The final results showed that the digital camera can be used as a tool for providing useful data for land cover classification.

The intensity of Urban Heat Island (UHI) associated with surface temperature and component attributes were assessed using the Community Land Model (CLM). The variations of UHI with Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) and climate variations were also investigated to provide a link among urbanization, surface energy balance interactions, and extreme hydroclimatic events which are drought ('big dry' and 'angry summer') and heavy rainfall ('big wet') in Melbourne, Australia. Generally, UHI demonstrated a uniform increasing trend with an similar to 1.20 +/- 0.20 degrees C increment, along with urbanization expansion of +14.93 % from 2001 to 2014. Furthermore, urban area showed positive contribution to UHI based on Land Contribution Index (LCI). High surface temperatures also resulted in higher sensible heat flux (Qh) and lower latent heat flux (Qle). During the multiple extreme climate events, the UHI biophysical drivers were majorly related to the convection reduction during 'big dry' (2001-2009), surface evaporative cooling during 'big wet' (2010-2011), and heat storage release during 'angry summer' (2012-2013).

Contrary to other observations, land use changes, due to urban growth, increased not only the built area but also the agriculture class. Agricultural area increased by 39% in the two decades. Population density increased from 1217 to 1806 person/km(2) and household density grew from 152 to 273 households/km(2) during 1991-2011. Land absorption coefficient (LAC) and land consumption ratio (LCR) were calculated as demographic indices of land use land cover change (LULC).

This study predicted LULC change and their impacts on seasonal (summer and winter) LST variations in Al Kut, Iraq. Landsat TM/OLI images for the years 2000, 2010, and 2020 were used to estimate LULC and LST's past status using remote sensing (RS) techniques. Based on the past characteristics of the images future LULC and seasonal LST were predicted for year 2030. Support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was used to classify the LULC classes. Artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm was used to predict the future LST considering the LULC indexes as influential variables. Results suggest a significant increase in urban area by +8.74% and reduction in green cover by -25.87% from 2000 to 2020. Increment in maximum LST took place for both summer and winter season by 3.79 degrees C and 3.16 degrees C in last two decades. Maximum LST was recorded in urban area (48 degrees C) and water bodies (35 degrees C) exhibit minimum LST. The correlation study demonstrates a strong positive relation of LST with Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) and negative relation with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). The prediction result also demonstrates increase in urban area (+17.02%) and loss of vegetation cover (-15.57%) for 2030.

Available reconstructions focus on the net area difference between two time steps (net changes) instead of accounting for all area gains and losses (gross changes). This leads to a serious underestimation of land-cover/use dynamics with impacts on the biogeochemical and environmental assessments based on these reconstructions. In this study, we quantified to what extent land-cover/use reconstructions underestimate land-cover/use changes in Europe for the 1900-2010 period by accounting for net changes only. We empirically analyzed available historic land-change data, quantified their uncertainty, corrected for spatial-temporal effects and identified underlying processes causing differences between gross and net changes. Gross changes varied for different land classes (largest for forest and grassland) and led to two to four times the amount of net changes. We applied the empirical results of gross change quantities in a spatially explicit reconstruction of historic land change to reconstruct gross changes for the EU27 plus Switzerland at 1km spatial resolution between 1950 and 2010. In addition, the reconstruction was extended back to 1900 to explore the effects of accounting for gross changes on longer time scales. We created a land-change reconstruction that only accounted for net changes for comparison. Our two model outputs were compared with five commonly used global reconstructions for the same period and area. In our reconstruction, gross changes led in total to a 56% area change (ca. 0.5%yr(-1)) between 1900 and 2010 and cover twice the area of net changes. All global reconstructions used for comparison estimated fewer changes than our gross change reconstruction.

There is, however, a lack of agreement among different methodologies on the magnitude and trends in LULCC emissions and their geographic distribution. Here we perform an evaluation of LULCC datasets for Brazil, including those used in the annual global carbon budget (GCB), and national Brazilian assessments over the period 2000-2018. Results show that the latest global HYDE 3.3 LULCC dataset, based on new FAO inventory estimates and multi-annual ESA CCI satellite-based land cover maps, can represent the observed spatial variation in LULCC over the last decades, representing an improvement on the HYDE 3.2 data previously used in GCB. However, the magnitude of LULCC assessed with HYDE 3.3 is lower than estimates based on MapBiomas. We use HYDE 3.3 and MapBiomas as input to a global bookkeeping model (bookkeeping of land use emission, BLUE) and a process-based Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (JULES-ES) to determine Brazil's LULCC emissions over the period 2000-2019. Results show mean annual LULCC emissions of 0.1-0.4 PgC yr(-1), compared with 0.1-0.24 PgC yr(-1) reported by the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Estimation System of land use changes and forest sector (SEEG/LULUCF) and by FAO in its latest assessment of deforestation emissions in Brazil. Both JULES-ES and BLUE now simulate a slowdown in emissions after 2004 (-0.006 and -0.004 PgC yr(-2) with HYDE 3.3, -0.014 and -0.016 PgC yr(-2) with MapBiomas, respectively), in agreement with the Brazilian INPE-EM, global Houghton and Nassikas book-keeping models, FAO and as reported in the 4th national greenhouse gas inventories. The inclusion of Earth observation data has improved spatial representation of LULCC in HYDE and thus model capability to simulate Brazil's LULCC emissions.

The following major characteristics of parishes were considered: whether their environment is suitable for tick and tick-host populations (depending on land cover); whether the local human population is likely to enter the forest on a regular base (depending on land use); and whether the spatial distributions of these two aspects are likely to intersect, through access rules (as a function of land ownership). The results indicated that all three aspects are important in explaining and predicting the spatial distribution of TBE cases in the rural areas of Latvia.

The land-cover indices used in this study are Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Index-Based Built-Up Index (IBI), Modified Bare-Soil Index (MBI), Plastic-Mulched Landcover Index (PMLI), Plastic Greenhouse Index (PGI) and Normalized Burn Ratio Thermal (NBRT) Index. Then, using the thermal bands of Landsat satellites, LST maps were created. Finally, the land-cover and LST changes were examined. The Kumluca district of Antalya, which includes extensive greenhouse areas as well as urban, vegetation, bareland, water, was selected as study area. Between the years 2004 and 2021, within the study area the greenhouse areas increased significantly, the urban area expanded and some areas exposed to fire, especially the fire in 2016. Therefore, the images within this time period were used. The overall accuracies for land-cover maps were computed as 76%, 79%, 79%, 89% and 86% for the years 2004, 2009, 2013, 2017 and 2021, respectively. The results obtained from the study reveal that while greenhouse and urban areas were increased, the vegetation areas were decreased significantly within this time period. In addition, generally increases were observed for LST values of all land-cover classes and the highest LST values were detected for the burned, bareland, urban and greenhouse areas.",Land Cover Mapping,Land Surface Temperature,Change Detection,Greenhouse,Land Cover Indices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"GEOSPATIAL WEEK 2023, VOL. 48-1",,,,,,,,,,,,

Images from Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Sentinel 2A (Multispectral Instrument) MSI data were used to extract land cover maps. Supervised classification using Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) was applied to prepare LULC maps of the watershed. The accuracy of the classified map was assessed using a High Resolution Planet scope image and ground realities have been verified and ascertained through field observations and site specific interviews. As a result of policy changes and traditional agroforestry systems, LULC in the study watershed has undergone a series of complicated changes over the past three decades. Six major LULC classes viz; agriculture, barren land, built-up area, dense forest, open forests and water bodies have been identified and indicate that major land use in the watershed is forestry. Results shows, dense forest, built-up area and water bodies have increased by 16.40% (41.76 km(2)), 2.13% (5.41 km(2)) and 0.11% (0.28 km(2)) while open forest, agriculture and barren land have decreased by -13.98% (-35.59 km(2)), 2.83% (-7.22 km(2)) and -1.82% (0.4.64 km(2)) respectively.

Land surface temperature (LST) is an important indicator for assessment of regional environment especially in big cities where urban heat island is very obvious. In this study, remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) were used to detect LUCC for assessment of its impacts on spatial variation of LST in Urumqi, a big city in northwestern China. Two Landsat TJVVETM images respectively in 1987 and 2002 were examined for LUCC detection. LST and NDVI were computed from the images for different land use/cover types. Impacts of LUCC on regional environment can be assessment through LST difference during the period. Our results showed that land use/cover changes were very obvious in Urumqi between 1987 and 2002 due to rapid expansion of the city. Urbanibuilt-up land increased by almost twice in the period, while the barren land, the forestland and water area declined. The increase of urbanibuilt-up land was mainly from the barren land. Spatial distribution of LST in the city has been highly altered as a result of urban expansion. The urbanibuilt-up area had LST increase by 4.48% during the period. The LST difference between built-up land and other land use/cover types also significantly increased between 1978 and 2002, with high LST increase area corresponding to the urban expansion regions. Moreover, changes of vegetation also had shaped many impacts on spatial variation of LST in the city. We found that NDVI has a negative correlation with LST among the land use/cover types. This probably is due to the ecological function of vegetation in cooling down the surface from high evapotranspiration. The study demonstrated that combination of remote sensing and GIS provided an efficient way to examine LUCC for assessment of its impacts on regional environment in big cities.",land use/cover change,land surface temperature,Landsat TM/ETM,NDVI,impact,,,"Xu, Bin","Zhang, Chunling","Lu, Liping","Gao, Maofang",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"GEOINFORMATICS 2007: REMOTELY SENSED DATA AND INFORMATION, PTS 1 AND 2",,,,,,,,,,,,

The land cover, monitored directly on the ground, is not always consistent with the land use entered in the Land and Property Registry (LPR). Discrepancies between these data are often found in former communist countries. One of the reasons for this was the rapid process of land privatisation, which took place in Poland, without updating information on the plot geodetic boundaries. The study examined and compared the land use (entered in the LPR) with the land cover (on the ground) for national roads (acr. LU-LC). The most frequent discrepancies were selected, using CLC2018, digital orthophotomaps (using the Web Map Service (WMS) browsing service compliant with Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards), cadastral data, statistical modelling and an updated survey of the right-of-way. Subsequently, six algorithms were proposed to synchronise the land use and land cover when the right-of-way was used by unauthorised persons, and two algorithms for cases of unauthorised use of land by the road administrator. Currently, it is difficult to synchronise the land cover with the land use from the administrative, legal and social points of view.

Thus, understanding the causes of changes in the EASM is paramount. Land cover and land use change can perturb a regional climate system through biogeophysical and biogeochemical processes. However, due to the scarcity of temporally continuous land cover and land use maps, the impact of land cover and land use change on the EASM is still not thoroughly explored. In the present study, this limitation was addressed via the production of annual land cover and land use maps of the East Asian summer monsoon region covering a period of 34 years (1982-2015). This was achieved through a random forest classification of phenological information derived from the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies Normalized Difference Vegetation Index dataset and terrain information from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite World 3D-30 m Digital Surface Model data.

Several studies have investigated the relationship between land surface characteristics and land surface temperature (LST). To explore the effects of the urban landscape on urban thermal environments, multiple land-use/land-cover (LULC) remote sensing-based indices have emerged. However, the function of the indices in better explaining LST in the heterogeneous urban landscape has not been fully addressed. This study aims to investigate the effect of remote-sensing-based LULC indices on LST, and to quantify the impact magnitude of green spaces on LST in the city built-up blocks. We used a random forest classifier algorithm to map LULC from the Gaofen 2 (GF-2) satellite and retrieved LST from Landsat-8 ETM data through the split-window algorithm. The pixel values of the LULC types and indices were extracted using the line transect approach. The multicollinearity effect was excluded before regression analysis. The vegetation index was found to have a strong negative relationship with LST, but a positive relationship with built-up indices was found in univariate analysis. The preferred indices, such as normalized difference impervious index (NDISI), dry built-up index (DBI), and bare soil index (BSI), predicted the LST (R-2 = 0.41) in the multivariate analysis. The stepwise regression analysis adequately explained the LST (R-2 = 0.44) due to the combined effect of the indices. The study results indicated that the LULC indices can be used to explain the LST of LULC types and provides useful information for urban managers and planners for the design of smart green cities.",land use/land cover (LULC),land surface temperature (LST),transect,remote sensing databased LULC indices,multivariate regression analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address global change challenges emanating from degrading natural resources, many countries voluntarily set themselves the goal of achieving Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN). Baseline conditions are to be established over a reference period (2000 - 2015). With seven more years to monitor this Sustainable Development Goal 15 indicator - SDG15.3.1 until the year 2030, the scientific basis for operationalizing LDN is still evolving. The non-availability of annual land use-land cover maps of sufficient resolution in various countries, among them Switzerland, is a major factor hampering the assessment at national and local levels. Land cover change is assessed for seven land categories (that is, Tree-covered area, Grassland, Cropland, Wetland, Artificial Surfaces, Otherland, and Waterbody). Land cover change is a major LDN sub-indicator required to assess the proportion of degraded land to total land area (SDG15.3.1). Annual land cover datasets from 2015 to 2020 were produced at 10 m from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images using a Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System-based workflow. An evaluation of degradation in land cover is presented in support of the operationalization of LDN in Switzerland. Drawing upon the understanding that changes made to land use-land cover may act as precursors to land degradation processes, transitions relating to the loss of natural cover were identified based on the land cover change criteria during the reference and the monitored periods. The criteria were developed for relating land cover transitions to degrading and non-degrading processes. Such transitions were grasslands to tree-covered areas and croplands to artificial surfaces due to settlement development. For example, the amount of cropland converted to artificial surface areas was greater in absolute terms during the monitored period than during the reference period. Also, the regeneration of natural cover involving transitions from otherland to grassland and from grasslands to tree-covered areas was found. Overall trends between 2000 and 2020 in Switzerland are the increasing settlement areas in the Central Plateau, the Alpine valleys of Valais and Ticino, largely at the expense of croplands and the bush encroachment of pastures such as in the Jura. This study's contributions include an enhanced workflow for annual land cover mapping for the entire Switzerland and the adaptation of the land cover change criteria to fit the Swiss context.

Simultaneously, succession and landscape evolution have facilitated forest regrowth and expansion. Detecting forest loss within known pulse disturbance events is often straightforward given that reduction in tree cover is a readily detectable and measurable land-cover change. Land-cover change is more difficult to quantify when disturbance events are unknown, remote, or environmental response is slow in relation to human observation. While disturbance events and related land-cover change are relatively instant, assessing patterns of post-disturbance succession requires long term monitoring. Here, we describe a method for classifying land cover and quantifying land-cover change over time, using Landsat legacy imagery for three historical eras on the western Kenai Peninsula: 1973-2002, 2002-2017, and 1973-2017. Scenes from numerous Landsat sensors, including summer and winter seasons, were acquired between 1973 and 2017 and used to classify vegetation cover using a random forest classifier. Land-cover type was summarized by era and combined to produce a dataset capturing spatially explicit land-cover change at a moderate 30-m resolution. Our results document large-scale forest loss across the study area that can be attributed to known disturbance events including beetle kill and wildfire. Despite numerous and extensive disturbances resulting in forest loss, we estimate that the study area has experienced net forest gain over the duration of our study period due to reforestation within large fire events that predate this study.

Catchment modelling is a popular approach to predicting the design flood quantiles of a catchment with complex spatial characteristics and limited monitoring data to obtain the necessary information for preparing the flood risk management plan. As an important indicator of urbanisation, land use land cover (LULC) plays a critical role in catchment parameterisation and modelling the rainfall-runoff process. Digitising LULC from remote sensing imagery of urban catchment is becoming increasingly difficult and time-consuming as the variability and diversity of land uses occur during urban development. In recent years, deep learning neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable image classification and segmentation outcomes with the powerful capacity to process complex workflow and features, learn sophisticated relationships and produce superior results. This paper describes end-to-end data assimilation and processing path using U-net and DeepLabV3+, also proposes a novel approach integrated with the clustering algorithm MeanShift. These methods were developed to generate pixel-based LULC semantic segmentation from high-resolution satellite imagery of the Alexandria Canal catchment, Sydney, Australia, and assess the applicability of their outputs as inputs to different catchment modelling systems. A significant innovation is using the MeanShift clustering algorithm to reduce the spatial noise in the raw image and propagate it to the deep learning network to improve prediction. All three methods achieved excellent classification performance, where the MeanShift+U-net has the highest accuracy and consistency on the test imagery. The final suitability assessment illustrates that all three methods are more suitable for the parameterisation of semi-distributed modelling systems rather than the fully distributed modelling systems, where the MeanShift+U-net should be adopted for image-based impervious area extraction of urban catchment due to its superior prediction accuracy of 98.47%.",catchment modelling,deep learning,land use land cover (LULC),remote sensing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In terms of the area under each LULC category, most significant changes have been observed in agriculture (-), plantation (+), built-up (+), and water (-); however, with reference to percent change within each class, the maximum variability was recorded in built-up (198.45%), plantation (87.98%), pasture (- 71%), water (- 48%) and agriculture (- 28.85%). The massive land transformation is largely driven by anthropogenic actions and has been mostly adverse in nature, giving rise to multiple environmental issues in the ecologically sensitive Kashmir valley.",Land use and land cover,Change detection,Landsat data,Classification,Kashmir valley,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A substantial loss of grassland cover (64.5%), moderate decline of cultivated land (24%) and a considerable increase in bush and shrub land cover (114.3%) occurred between 1985 and 2015. Consequently, pastoralist's access to rangeland resources and farmlands was highly restricted, thus putting the pastoral production system under increasing threat. A 13.3% decline of bare land was also observed during the same period. The results further indicated that policy, climate change, and variability, biotic factors including population growth, overgrazing, Prosopis juliflora seed dispersal via livestock's fecal droppings and seed germination potential of P. juliflora under moisture stress were the most important drivers of land-use and land-cover changes.

There is, therefore, a clear need for the continuous and reliable monitoring of land cover and land cover changes. The growing availability of high resolution, regularly collected remote sensing data can support the increasing number of applications that require high spatial resolution products that are frequently updated (e.g., annually). However, large-scale operational mapping requires a highly-automated data processing workflow, which is currently lacking. To address this issue, we developed a methodology for the automated classification of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery. The method uses a random forest classifier and existing land cover/use databases as the source of training samples. In order to demonstrate its operability, the method was implemented on a large part of the European continent, with CORINE Land Cover and High-Resolution Layers as training datasets. A land cover/use map for the year 2017 was produced, composed of 13 classes. An accuracy assessment, based on nearly 52,000 samples, revealed high thematic overall accuracy (86.1%) on a continental scale, and average overall accuracy of 86.5% at country level. Only low-frequency classes obtained lower accuracies and we recommend that their mapping should be improved in the future. Additional modifications to the classification legend, notably the fusion of thematically and spectrally similar vegetation classes, increased overall accuracy to 89.0%, and resulted in ten, general classes. A crucial aspect of the presented approach is that it embraces all of the most important elements of Earth observation data processing, enabling accurate and detailed (10 m spatial resolution) mapping with no manual user involvement.

Most of land cover/land use (LCLU) assessments in this region have been based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Cropland Data Layer (USDA - CDL), which may be inconsistent. Here, we demonstrate an approach to map land cover utilizing multi-temporal Earth Observation data from Landsat and MODIS. We first built an annual time series of accumulated growing degree-days (AGDD) from MODIS 8-day composites of land surface temperatures. Using the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) derived from Landsat Collection 1's surface reflectance, we then fit at each pixel a downward convex quadratic model to each year's progression of AGDD (i.e., EVI = alpha + beta x AGDD - gamma x AGDD(2)). Phenological metrics derived from fitted model and the goodness of fit then are submitted to a random forest classifier (RFC) to characterize LCLU for four sample counties in South Dakota in three years (2006, 2012, 2014) when reference point datasets are available for training and validation. To examine the sensitivity of the RFC to sample size and design, we performed classifications under different sample selection scenarios. The results indicate that our proposed method accurately mapped major crops in the study area but showed limited accuracy for non-vegetated land covers. Although all RFC models exhibit high accuracy, estimated land cover areas from alternative models could vary widely, suggesting the need for a careful examination of model stability in any future land cover supervised classification study. Among all sampling designs, the ""same distribution"" models (proportional distribution of the sample is like proportional distribution of the population) tend to yield best land cover prediction. RFC used only the most eight important variables (e.g., three fitted parameter coefficients [alpha, beta, and gamma]; maximum modeled EVI; AGDD at maximum modeled EVI; the number of observations used to fit CxQ model; and the number of valid observations) have slightly higher accuracy compared to those using all variables. By summarizing annual image time series through land surface phenology modeling, LCLU classification can embrace both seasonality and interannual variability, thereby increasing the accuracy of LCLU change detection.",Land cover/land use,Land surface phenology,Random forest classifier,Croplands,Grasslands,South Dakota,,"Henebry, Geoffrey M.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to advancements in remote sensing, there is an abundance of open data available but annotating this data is expensive. As a result, many research works in EO create a labelled dataset for one selected region and perform a corresponding regional analysis. By employing transfer learning, we can reuse these labelled datasets for different regions and thereby minimize the manual annotation costs. However, there are some open questions: to what extent can the features learned in one region be transferred to another? Does a larger pre-training dataset mean better transfer learning performance? How can we estimate the transfer learning performance? To answer these questions, we divide a large EO dataset called BigEarthNet into sub-datasets by region and perform region to region transfer learning. We find that the models trained on one region do not perform well on another region. We applied transfer learning techniques and showed that the class imbalance can hinder learning. If the source region has additional classes which are dominant in the source region or has fewer images for the classes dominant in the target region, transfer learning can have negative impacts on the model performance in the target region.

However, excessive exploitation and over-utilization of natural resources, particularly water resources, have triggered a series of ecological and environmental problems, such as the reduction in the volume of water in the main river, deterioration of water quality, drying up of downstream rivers, degradation of vegetation, and land desertification. In this study, the land use/land cover change (LUCC) responses to ecological water conveyance in the lower reaches of the Tarim River were investigated using ENVI (Environment for Visualizing Images) and GIS (Geographic Information System) data analysis software for the period of 1990-2018. Multi-temporal remote sensing images and ecological water conveyance data from 1990 to 2018 were used. The results indicate that LUCC covered an area of 2644.34 km(2) during this period, accounting for 15.79% of the total study area. From 1990 to 2018, wetland, farmland, forestland, and artificial surfaces increased by 533.42 km(2) (216.77%), 446.68 km(2) (123.66%), 284.55 km(2) (5.67%), and 57.51 km(2) (217.96%), respectively, whereas areas covered by grassland and other land use/land cover types, such as Gobi, bare soil, and deserts, decreased by 103.34 km(2) (14.31%) and 1218.83 km(2) (11.75%), respectively.

It is also considered one of the major factors affecting groundwater recharge. Uncertainties and inconsistencies in LULC maps are one of the difficulties that LULC timeseries analysis face and which have a significant effect on hydrological impact analysis. Therefore, an accuracy assessment approach of LULC timeseries is needed for a more reliable hydrological analysis and prediction. The objective of this paper is to assess the impact of land use uncertainty and to improve the accuracy of a timeseries of CORINE (coordination of information on the environment) land cover maps by using a new approach of identifying spatial-temporal LULC change trajectories as a pre-processing tool. This ensures consistency of model input when dealing with land-use dynamics and as such improves the accuracy of land use maps and consequently groundwater recharge estimation. As a case study the impact of consistent land use changes from 1990 until 2013 on groundwater recharge for the Flanders-Brussels region is assessed. The change trajectory analysis successfully assigned a rational trajectory to 99% of all pixels. The methodology is shown to be powerful in correcting interpretation inconsistencies and overestimation errors in CORINE land cover maps. The overall kappa (cell-by-cell map comparison) improved from 0.6 to 0.8 and from 0.2 to 0.7 for forest and pasture land use classes respectively. The study shows that the inconsistencies in the land use maps introduce uncertainty in groundwater recharge estimation in a range of 10-30%. The analysis showed that during the period of 1990-2013 the LULC changes were mainly driven by urban expansion. The results show that the resolution at which the spatial analysis is performed is important; the recharge differences using original and corrected CORINE land cover maps increase considerably with increasing spatial resolution. This study indicates that improving consistency of land use map timeseries is of critical importance for assessing land use change and its environmental impact. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This research fills a gap in the literature by exploring the issues of modelling coupled LUCC and urban growth, their causes, and the role of policymakers. Tabriz metropolitan area (TMA), located at north-west Iran, was chosen as a case study to design an integrated framework using four well-established methods: cellular automata (CA), Markov chains (MC), logistic regression (LR), and stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA). Northern, north-west, and central TMA were affected the worst by urbanisation and the loss of cultivated and grassland between 1990 and 2020. The accessibility of arterial roadways and proximity to major cities influenced these changes. Three scenarios characterise LUCC dynamics: the uncontrolled growth scenario (UGS) and the historical trend growth scenario (HTGS) foresee significant loss of cultivated land and continued urban expansion above the long-term average in 2050, while the environmental protection growth scenario (EPGS) promotes sustainable development and compact urbanisation.

But, yearly agricultural practices such as crop rotations often complicate the spatially explicit modeling of specific crops' expansion. Our research focused on developing a geospatial modeling framework that is able to distinguish long-term, regional changes in croplands from short-term, local fluctuations (such as rotations), using geographic information systems (GIS) and the land transformation model (LTM). The USDA Cropland Data Layers (CDLs) of North Dakota for 1999, 2000, 2004, 2005, 2010, and 2011 were spatially and temporally aggregated to generate a series of biofuel cropland maps. The historical cropland data for 1999/2000 and 2004/2005, together with a collection of environmental factors (i.e., topography, soil fertility, and climate), were used to calibrate the neural network embedded in the LTM. Validation analysis was then conducted by simulating the biofuel cropland change during the period of 2004/2005-2010/2011 using the calibrated LTM and comparing the simulation result with the observed change for the same time period, resulting in 6.3% allocation disagreement (0% quantity disagreement) and 27.4% figure of merit.

These were assessed using Geographic Information Systems tools and statistical analyses for the years 1994, 2000, 2008 and 2011 based on changes over time of eight LULC classes and available water quality information. Natural vegetation, forest plantations and cultivated areas occupy 85% of the catchment. Cultivated, urban/built-up and degraded areas increased by 6%, 4.5% and 3%, respectively coinciding with a decrease in natural vegetation by 17%. Variability in the concentration of water quality parameters from 1994 to 2011 and an overall decline in water quality were observed. Escherichia coli (E. coli) levels exceeding the recommended guidelines for recreation and public health protection was noted as a major issue at seven of the nine sampling points. Overall, water supply reservoirs in the catchment retained over 20% of nutrients and over 85% of E. coli entering them. A relationship between land use types and water quality variables was found. However, the degree and magnitude of the associations varies between sub-catchments and is difficult to quantify. This highlights the complexity and the site-specific nature of relationships between land use types and water quality parameters in the catchment.

Our objective is to monitor and examine vegetation and land-use changes, including PES-related afforestation, between 1989 and 2017. We utilize several image processing techniques, such as illumination normalization approaches to suppress terrain effects, and multi-seasonal image compositing to minimize persistent cloud cover. Ancillary data were also incorporated to generate reliable vegetation and land-use change information. A random forest machine learning image classification routine is implemented through the cloud-based Google Earth Engine platform and refined using optimal classifier parameter tuning. Land-use transitions are identified and mapped with the implementation of stable training sites, discrete image classification, and logical land-use transition rules. Accuracy assessment results indicate our change detection workflow provides a reliable methodology to remotely monitor long-term forest cover and land-use changes in this mountainous, forested, and cloud prevalent region. We quantify the area of new built development and afforestation land and found that most of the land transitions took place in reserve buffer and its adjacent environs. For example, less than 2 km(2) of new built was identified within the reserve boundary compared to 25 km(2) for the entire study area between 1995 and 2016.

Using a geographical information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS), this study analysed land use and land cover change pattern in Lake Qinghai watershed between 1977 and 2004 and discussed major environmental issues in this area. LUCC analysis indicated that grassland (63 per cent) and water body (18 per cent) dominated in the watershed and the magnitude of the land use and land cover change was generally low; the percentage of the change of various land types relative to the total area was less than I per cent. From 1977 to 2004, cropland, sandy land, bare rock, salinized land, swampland and built-up areas increased by 0.43, 0.35, 0.24, 0.06, 0.03 and 0.03 per cent of the total area, respectively; in contrast, water body, grassland and woodland decreased by 0.99, 0.22 and 0.05 per cent, respectively. Moreover, the area of LUCC tended to expand from places around the lake to the upper reaches of the watershed during the last three decades.

Land use and land cover change are affecting the global and regional climate change through the carbon emissions. Meanwhile, carbon sequestration could replenish and contribute to the decrease of CO2 emissions. Rapid urbanized areas have typical urbanized characteristics and carbon reduction target. Therefore, it is a vital issue to explore the carbon sequestration in rapid urbanized area. This paper analyzed the mechanism between carbon sequestration and land use and land cover change in Shanghai city. Based on the Landsat TM/ETM images from 1990 to 2015 and using the InVEST model, we assessed the temporal and spatial variations of carbon sequestration in response to the expansion of built-up areas and obtained a reliable estimate of terrestrial carbon sequestration at 30 m x 30 m grid scale, including biomass and soil carbon stocks.

Thus, LUCC analysis may lay foundation for landscape planning, conservation and management. It is especially true for alpine landscapes, which are more susceptible to climate changes and human activities. However, the information on LUCC in sacred landscape is limited, which will hinder the landscape conservation and development. We chose Kailash Sacred Landscape in China (KSL-China) to investigate the patterns and dynamics of LUCC and the driving forces using remote sensing data and meteorological data from 1990 to 2008. A supervised classification of land use and land cover was established based on field survey. Rangelands presented marked fluctuations due to climatic warming and its induced drought, for example, dramatic decreases were found in high- and medium-cover rangelands over the period 2000-2008. And recession of most glaciers was also observed in the study period. Instead, an increase of anthropogenic activities accelerated intensive alteration of land use, such as conversion of cropland to built-up land. We found that the change of vegetation cover was positively correlated with growing season precipitation (GSP). In addition, vegetation cover was substantially reduced along the pilgrimage routes particularly within 5 km of the routes. The findings of the study suggest that climatic warming and human disturbance are interacted to cause remarkable LUCC. Tourism development was responsible land use change in urban and pilgrimage routes. This study has important implications for landscape conservation and ecosystem management. The reduction of rangeland cover may decrease the rangeland quality and pose pressure for the carrying capacity of rangelands in the KSL-China.

During this process, many rural lands, such as forests and wetlands, have transformed to human settlements. Taking Daqing City, Heilongjiang Province, China as the case study area, this paper analyzed the long-term (from 1977 to 2007) land use land cover change, and modeled the change using a system dynamic model. In particular, land use land cover maps in 1977, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2001, and 2007 were derived from Landsat multi-spectral Scanner (MSS) and Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery. Through analyzing the trend of land use land cover change, three groups of driving forces, including land use management, population growth, and economic and social policies, have been identified to model LUCC in the Daqing City. Finally, future land use change scenarios were simulated under three socio-economic policies: 1) current economic growth, 2) rapid economic growth, and 3) sustainable development. Analysis of results suggests that Daqing City has expanded significantly at the cost of forests and wetlands from 1977 to 2007. Moreover, systems dynamic modeling results suggest that three identified groups of driving forces can effectively explain past land use change in the study area. Finally, simulation results indicate that 1) under current and rapid economic growth policies, built-up land in Daqing City increase significantly, while the areas of grassland and wetlands decrease remarkably, and 2) under the sustainable development policy, the conflict between population expansion and land resource shortage can be alleviated to some extent.

S.",,Impact of land cover and land use change on runoff characteristics,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,SEP 15 2015,189,"Change in Land Cover and Land Use (LCLU) influences the runoff characteristics of a drainage basin to a large extent, which in turn, affects the surface and groundwater availability of the area, and hence leads to further change in LCLU. This forms a vicious circle. Hence it becomes essential to assess the effect of change in LCLU on the runoff characteristics of a region in general and of small watershed levels (subbasin levels) in particular. Such an analysis can effectively be carried out by using watershed simulation models with integrated GIS frame work. SWAT (Soil and Water Analysis Tool) model, being one of the versatile watershed simulation models, is found to be suitable for this purpose as many GIS integration modules are available for this model (e.g. ArcSWAT, MWSWAT). Watershed simulation using SWAT requires the land use and land cover data, soil data and many other features. With the availability of repository of satellite imageries, both from Indian and foreign sources, it becomes possible to 'use the concurrent local land use and land cover data, thereby enabling more accurate modelling of small watersheds. Such availability will also enable us to assess the effect of LCLU on runoff characteristics and their reverse impact. The current study assesses the effect of land use and land cover on the runoff characteristics of two watersheds in Kerala, India. It also assesses how the change in land use and land cover in the last few decades affected the runoff characteristics of these watersheds. It is seen that the reduction in the forest area amounts to 60% and 32% in the analysed watersheds. However, the changes in the surface runoff for these watersheds are not comparable with the changes in the forest area but are within 20%. Similarly the maximum (peak) value of runoff has increased by an amount of 15% only. The lesser (aforementioned) effect than expected might be due to the fact that forest has been converted to agricultural purpose with major portion as plantations which have comparatively similar characteristics of the forest except for evapo-transpiration. The double sided action (increase in evapo-transpiration owing to species like rubber and increase percolation due to its plantation method by using terracing) might be the reason for relatively smaller effect of the land use change, not commensurate with the changes in the forest area amounting to 60% and 32% for Manali and Kurumali watersheds respectively. Water harvesting methods like rain harvesting ditches can be made mandatory where species with high evapo-transpiration are grown. This action shall enhance the groundwater percolation and shall counter act the effect due to high evapo-transpiration. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we examined the land use / land cover change trends from 2000 to 2020 in the Sudano-Guinean region of Benin, and analysed the driving factors of those changes. The adopted method is based on the diachronic analysis of the land cover through the use of remote sensing data specifically, Landsat satellite images of 2000 and 2020. The results showed that natural forest vegetation and Savannah strongly decreased, whereas farmland and the built-up area increased. Indeed, forest land lost 3.22%, 2.01%, and 1.57%, in Bante, Glazou?, and Ou?ss?, respectively. The intensification of human activities was identified as the proximate driver while population growth, a growing demand for agricultural and forest products coupled with improved infrastructure were identified as the underlying drivers of deforestation. To achieve sustainable management goal for forest resources in Benin, the introduction of alternative sources of energy, sustainable farming practices, diversification of income sources, the promotion of community participation, should be implemented.",Benin,Sudano-Guinean zone,land use,land cover change,forest change,remote sensing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such a data set collected regularly through time could inform and focus field monitoring efforts, and help prioritize restoration and mitigation efforts. Unfortunately, few data sets exist that are bi-nationally consistent in time, classification method, or resolution. To this end, we integrated land cover data across both the Canadian (Ontario Provincial Land Cover data) and US portions (National Land Cover Data) of the Lake Superior basin for two time steps (approximately 1992 and 2001) roughly one decade apart. After harmonizing landcover classes across the two datasets we compared the explicit amount and relative amount (total hectares and proportion of each area as percents) for each of the common land cover classes that occurred across the two time steps for the entire Lake Superior basin, for the U.S. portion of the Lake Superior basin only, and for the Canadian portion of the Lake Superior basin only. We also compared land cover change for the entire basin within a 1 km and a 10 km buffer of the Great Lakes shoreline. We then summarized and compared these land cover types for each time period across a common set of watersheds derived from elevation data (Hollenhorst et al., 2007) for the entire Lake Superior basin. This allowed us to identify and quantify the types of change occurring generally across the entire basin, more specifically across both the U. S. and Canadian portions of the basin, and more explicitly for near coastal areas and watersheds across the entire basin. Noteworthy changes were detected across the basin, particularly an increase in mixed forest types and a corresponding decrease in coniferous forest types.",Great Lakes,land use change,National Land Cover Data,Ontario Provincial Land Cover,Binational Land Cover,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The range of CN(PQ) from 70 to 79 are most significant values and these truly represent the AMC II condition for the Sher watershed. The annual CN(LU) was computed for all three watersheds using GIS and the years are 1973, 1989 and 2000. Satellite imagery of MSS, TM and ETM+ sensors are available for these years and obtained from the Global Land Cover Facility Data Center of Maryland University USA. The computed CN(LU) values show rising trend with the time and this trend is attributed to expansion of agriculture area in all watersheds. The predicted values of CN(LU) with time (year) can be used to predict runoff potential under the effect of change in LULC. Comparison of CN(LU) and CN(PQ) values shows close agreement and it also validates the classification of LULC. The estimation of slope adjusted SA-CN2 shows the significant difference over conventional CN for the hilly forest lands. For the micro watershed planning, SCS-CN method should be modified to incorporate the effect of change in land use and land cover along with effect of land slope. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This increase in urbanization has affected the natural resources such as vegetation and water bodies. In the present study, the effects of urbanization on LULC (Land Use Land Cover) changes of Warangal urban and rural areas are studied for the years 2014, 2017 and 2020 for a span of 6 years using the RS and GIS techniques. LANDSAT imagery of 3 years is collected and enhanced and LULC data is extracted for four classes i.e., urbanization (built-up land), agriculture cum forest (vegetation), bear soil (barren land) and water bodies. RS and GIS tools are used to compare and analyze the effect of urbanization. LULC feature extraction is made for urban and rural areas of Warangal region using supervised classification to study the growth of urban areas and its effect on LULC changes. The results indicate a drastic increase in urbanization and barren land, severe decrease in vegetation and a very slight increase in waterbodies. Increase in urbanization and decrease in agriculture cum forest indicates vegetation reduction and built-up area increment which directly affects the climate and environment.

Therefore, in the present work to partially fill the research gap, an attempt has been made to explore the relationships between geodiversity and land use/land cover diversity of the Birbhum district, India following the principles of richness index. The spatial correlations between geodiversity and land use/ land cover diversity have been examined statistically by applying both correlation and regression analyses. The result shows a linear positive correlation between geodiversity and land use/land cover diversity of the concerned district that implies the fact that the areas of high geodiversity are also associated with the areas of high land use/land cover diversity and vice versa.

The major LULCC during 2001-2018 were conversions from grasslands to croplands over the central regions of Northeast China and conversions from woody savannas to deciduous broadleaf forests in the northern and eastern portions of Northeast China. The changes in Fg and albedo are highly correlated with the daytime land surface temperature (Ts). From 2001 to 2018, the daytime Ts is decreased (increased) over the central regions of Northeast China by more than 1 K in summer (winter). There is also a widespread, about 1 K, cooling in the spring and autumn temperatures. The changes of the nighttime Ts and the daytime Ts from 2001 to 2018 are similar in summer, autumn, and winter, but the nighttime Ts changes are comparatively smaller. Analysis of the surface energy budget and the biophysical effects found that the cooling of the daytime Ts over the central regions of Northeast China in spring, summer, and autumn from 2001 to 2018 can be attributed to a decrease of absorbed shortwave radiation and an increase of latent heat flux corresponding to LULCC. This cooling is weakened by the decrease of the sensible heat flux. In contrast, the widespread warming trend of the daytime Ts in winter is mainly due to an increased net shortwave radiation, which offsets the cooling effects of surface fluxes. During the nighttime, the soil heat flux contributes the most to the changes of Ts.",biophysical effects,land surface temperature,land use and land cover change,,,,,"Zhang, Lei","Xu, Haixiang",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The climate period is different from the chosen land use change period due to the unavailability of satellite images. Standardized anomaly index, break points, trend analysis, and Thiessen's polygon were applied. Satellite images were processed and ground truthing was carried out to assess land cover changes.

This poses a challenge to the balance of urban development and ecological protection, which may be more serious in ecologically fragile regions. This study identified key LULC change (LULCC) impacts on ESs in Ordos, an ecologically fragile region in Northwest China. The urbanization process of Ordos will continue in 2030 under the business-as-usual scenario due to its strategic positioning in the National Energy Base of China. The future LULC simulation results showed that developed land in eastern Ordos will continue to expand in 2030, and more forest and grassland will appear in western Ordos as a result of ecological restoration. The results of the InVEST model in calculating four important ESs showed that the ES supply in the densely populated areas (eastern Ordos) has declined, and more attention must be given to natural vegetation protection in the urbanization process. Although carbon storage in the western region has increased due to afforestation, this also reduces the water yield supply, which may exacerbate the water shortage in Ordos. Supported by this framework, more sustainable urban land use management can be undertaken to balance the conflict between ecological protection and urbanization.

Four fully coupled simulations were performed: with and without LUCC for two scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). Model results show that the global LUCC effects are very small because of offsetting regional signals. Future global land-use emissions due to LUCC in the two scenarios are estimated to be 35.7 and 32.1 Pg C, respectively. The largest regional responses are directly associated with the land cover conversion in the tropics and subtropics. As the albedo effect dominates in mid- and high-latitudes, LUCC produces a small cooling or little effect in the western United States and Eurasia as a result of the reduction in needleleaf evergreen trees. LUCC increases temperature by 0.05-0.1 degrees C in the tropics due to the reduction in evapotranspiration because of the conversion from rainforests to croplands. When compared with greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosol influences, LUCC has a second-order effect on the temperature change at the global scale. However, for the CO2 fluxes, the LUCC and GHG/aerosol effects are equally important and the former is much stronger than the latter over some regions such as Africa and South and North America. The land-atmosphere CO2 flux can be regionally modulated by LUCC when compared with the effects of GHG/aerosol forcings. Although there is no significant land cover change in higher latitudes, climate responses to LUCC occur over boreal and arctic regions, indicating that atmospheric teleconnection can modify regional climate far away from the areas with LUCC. These results highlight the need to understand the responses of carbon cycle and remote climate to LUCC over longer time scales.",land use and land cover change,future climate projection,climatic impact,,,,,"Zhou, Liming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, estimates of these carbon fluxes are often aggregated to larger areas. We estimated committed gross carbon fluxes related to LULCC in Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany, using different emission factors. In doing so, we compared four different data sources regarding their suitability for estimating the fluxes: (a) a land cover dataset derived from OpenStreetMap (OSMlanduse); (b) OSMlanduse with removal of sliver polygons (OSMlanduse cleaned), (c) OSMlanduse enhanced with a remote sensing time series analysis (OSMlanduse+); (d) the LULCC product of Landschaftsveranderungsdienst (LaVerDi) from the German Federal Agency of Cartography and Geodesy. We produced a high range of carbon flux estimates, mostly caused by differences in the area of the LULCC detected by the different change methods. Except for the OSMlanduse change method, all LULCC methods achieved results that are comparable to other gross emission estimates. The carbon flux estimates of the most plausible change methods, OSMlanduse cleaned and OSMlanduse+, were 291,710 Mg C yr(-1) and 93,591 Mg C yr(-1), respectively. Uncertainties were mainly caused by incomplete spatial coverage of OSMlanduse, false positive LULCC due to changes and corrections made in OpenStreetMap during the study period, and a high number of sliver polygons in the OSMlanduse changes.

Consequently, there significant transitions incurred among different land use classes as well as a homogenization of the fuel bands, increasing the extension and complexity of fire prone areas. Portugal was particularly affected by forest fires (FF) with more than 18,000 FF/year and annual burnt area (BA) of 107,000 ha/year since 1980, while the average size of such events has increased from 4 ha to 13 ha in the last 10 years. This study analysed the FF occurred in continental Portugal between 1990 and 2013, with the main focus on: (i) assess the global and regional differences/similarities in LULCC and fire regime; (ii) evaluating the role of FF on LULCC and; (iii) to provide a better understanding (identification and characterization) of space-time cluster distribution of FF.

Between natural factors and human activities, the latter are considered the main cause of desertification, with the excessive use of land resources accelerating its risk. This study classified the degree of desertification into five types, no, light, moderate, severe, and extremely severe desertification, and focused on the spatio-temporal changes in LULC, desertification development, and their relationship in the Circum-Tarim Basin during the period of 1990-2020, and the results indicated the following. (1) Over the 30-year study period, farmland development was frequent in the basin. The total farmland area increased significantly by 1.40 x 104 km2, which resulted from the occupation of grassland (mainly low-covered and medium-covered grassland) and unused land (mainly saline-alkali land). (2) There was a general alleviation of the effects of desertification, but also local deterioration. The area of no-desertification land has significantly increased (an increase of 2.10 x 104 km2), and the degree of desertification has shifted significantly to adjacent lighter degrees, but the area of extremely severe desertification in certain regions has increased (an increase of 7.89 x 104 km2). (3) There was an inseparable relationship between LULC and desertification. Oasisization and desertification were two processes that interacted and were interrelated. There was an approximately 54.42% increase in no-desertification land area mainly occurring in the region where LULC types changed (Region II), although this area only accounted for 9.71% of the total area of the basin. There was an approximately 98.28% increase in the area of extremely severe desertification occurring where there were no changes in LULC types (Region I). Region II demonstrated the best effects of desertification prevention and control in the 30-year study period in the Circum-Tarim Basin. Land development and oasis expansion have led to concentrated water use, resulting in water scarcity in certain areas, which cannot support the needs of vegetation growth, thus aggravating the degradation. Hence, ""adapting measures to local conditions, rational planning, zoning policies, precise prevention and control"" will be the way forward for desertification control in the future in the Circum-Tarim Basin.",desertification,Land Use/Land Cover,the Circum-Tarim Basin,desertification control,spatial-temporal process,,,"Feng, Yiming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Land degradation involves two interlocking systems: the natural ecosystem and the socio-economic system. The complexity of land degradation processes should be addressed using a multidisciplinary approach. Therefore, the aim of this work is to assess diachronically land degradation dynamics under changing land covers. This paper analyzes LULCCs and the parallel increase in the level of land sensitivity to degradation along the coastal belt of Sardinia (Italy), a typical Mediterranean region where human pressure affects the landscape characteristics through fires, intensive agricultural practices, land abandonment, urban sprawl, and tourism concentration. Results reveal that two factors mainly affect the level of land sensitivity to degradation in the study area: (i) land abandonment and (ii) unsustainable use of rural and peri-urban areas. Taken together, these factors represent the primary cause of the LULCCs observed in coastal Sardinia. By linking the structural features of the Mediterranean landscape with its functional land degradation dynamics over time, these results contribute to orienting policies for sustainable land management in Mediterranean coastal areas.",Land sensitivity,Land management,Coastal area,Multi-temporal land cover maps,Sardinia,Italy,,"Ferrara, A.","Salvati, L.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study analysed the spatial and temporal pattern of land use/land cover change in the Camili forest planning unit that includes the Camili Biosphere Reserve Area within the Caucasian hotspot, in the northeast corner of Turkey. To assess the patterns during a 33-year period, the necessary data were obtained from forest stand maps and evaluated with Geographic Information Systems and FRAGSTATS. Results showed that the total forested areas increased from 19 946 center dot 5 ha (78 center dot 6% of the study area) in 1972 to 20 797 center dot 3 ha (81 center dot 9 per cent) in 2005 with a slight net increase of 851 ha. Softwood cover types (411 center dot 8 ha) completely transitioned to other cover types over 33-year period. In terms of spatial configuration, the total number of forest fragments increased from 172 to 608, and mean size of forest patch (NIPS) decreased from 147 center dot 7 ha to 41 center dot 8 ha during the period. Nearly 84 per cent of the patches in 1972 and 93 per cent of them in 2005 generally seem to concentrate into 0-100 ha patch size class, indicating more fragmented landscape over time that might create a risk for the maintenance of biodiversity of the area. There were apparent trends in the temporal structure of forest landscape, some of which may issue from mismanagement of the area, social conflict, and illegal utilization of forest resources due to ineffective forest protection measurements. The study revealed that it is important to understand both spatial and temporal changes of land use/land cover and their effects on landscape pattern to disclose the implications for land use planning and management.

This study describes the spatial-temporal changes in land use and land cover (LULC) in the Bahraich district and the underlying mechanisms behind these changes. To detect the land transformation, satellite images for over 30 years (1991-2021) have been used. Five major LULC classes (agriculture, forest, water bodies, built-up area, and sand) have been taken into consideration for analyzing the land transformation. The aim of the study is to find out the level at which the LULC changes have taken place and their correlation with the population dynamism. It has been found that the population growth in the Bahraich district has a very strong correlation with LULC classes defined in this study which includes both natural and anthropogenic features. In these 30 years, natural features like waterbody (-74.01%), fallow land (- 72.89%), forest (- 26.20%), and sand (- 38%) have seen a major loss in the area coverage due to extensive anthropogenic activities. These classes are strongly correlated with human population growth with Rho values of - .963, - .947,- .983, and - .830, respectively. Other classes such as built-up and agriculture have shown a strong positive correlation with the expension of human population. The Rho values of built-up and agriculture are noted to be .982 and .986, respectively, whereas the increase in the area of land surface cover is found to be 394.57% and 43.04% respectively. This signifies that the geometrical progression in the human population has amplified anthropogenic activities vastly, resulting in the loss of areal extent of natural classes such as water bodies, forest, fallow land, and sand and increment in the area extent of human-induced activities such as agriculture and built-up. For the abovementioned analysis, Landsat 4-5 TM images for the year 1991 and 2007 and Landsat 8 OLI images for the year 2021 have been used. The results have shown that although the study area is rich in biodiversity, yet it has been facing escalating environmental issues due to acute land surface transformation resulting majorly due to human-induced activities. The majority of the transitions are reversible. The research area's LULC change processes are primarily influenced by socioeconomic, demographic, and proximity variables.

Thus, quantification of LULC and change through time may be a key factor in understanding the near-shore ecology of this system. The work described in this paper is part of a larger effort called the Great Lakes Environmental Indicators Project (GLEI), whose goal was to develop and refine environmental state indicators for the U.S. near-shore zone of the Great Lakes. Here we describe methodologies for using existing Landsat-based LULC maps to assemble consistent LULC data for the U.S. portion of the Great Lakes basin for 1992 and 2001, as well as summarizing salient LULC results. Between 1992 and 2001, 2.5% (798,755 ha) of the U.S. portion of the Great Lakes watershed experienced change. Transitions due to new construction included a 33.5% (158,858 ha) increase in low-intensity development and a 7.5% (140,240 ha) increase in road area. Agricultural and forest land each experienced similar to 2.3% (259,244 ha and 322,463 ha, respectively) decrease in area. Despite the large and enduring agricultural losses observed (2.23% of 1992 agricultural area), the rate of agricultural land decrease between 1992 and 2001 was less than that reported by the EPA (-9.8%) for the previous similar to 10-year period. Areas of new development were largely concentrated near coastal areas of the Great Lakes. Over 38% (6,014 ha) of wetland losses to development between 1992 and 2001 occurred within 10 km of a coastal area, and most of that area was within the nearest 1 kilometer. Clearly, these land use change data will be especially useful as quantifiable indicators of landscape change over time and aid in future land use planning decisions for protection of the integrity of the Great Lakes ecosystem.",Great Lakes,Landsat,land use,land cover,indicators,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, examining the variation of land-surface temperatures and mitigating the related impacts remain a challenge. The present study employed remote-sensing and geoinformational techniques to examine land-use/land-cover change and its effects on land-surface temperature variations in the villages within the Luki Biosphere Reserve, Democratic Republic of Congo. Land-use/land-cover change for the year 2038 was predicted by using the CA-Markov chain. Additionally, focus-group discussions (FGDs) with local communities from different villages were applied to better understand the impact of climate change, considering the increase of land-surface temperature. The results revealed major changes in land-use/land-cover in the four villages from 2002 to 2020, principally the expansion of fallow land and built-up areas, as well as the decline in forest land, and the complex of young secondary and degraded forest. There was an increase in mean LST values over all villages between 2002 and 2020. The highest value was observed in Tsumba kituti (25.12 degrees C), followed by Kisavu (24.87 degrees C), Kibuya (23.31 degrees C) and Kiobo (21.82 degrees C). Between 2002 and 2020, the mean LST of built-up areas increased from 23.18 to 25.12 degrees C, 21.55 to 23.38 degrees C, 21.4 to 25.78 degrees C and 22.31 to 25.62 degrees C in Tsumba kituti, Kiobo, Kisavu and Kibuya, respectively. Moreover, the mean LST of fallow land increased from 20.8 to 23.2 degrees C, 21.13 to 22.12 degrees C, 21.89 to 23.12 degrees C and 20.31 to 23.47 degrees C in Tsumba, Kiobo, Kibuya and Kisavu, respectively. This indicates that built-up and fallow land experienced the highest land-surface temperature compared to other land-use/land-cover categories. Meanwhile, the conversion of all land-use/land-cover categories into built-up areas in all the villages resulted in the increase of the land-surface temperature. FGDs results recognize the recurrent land-use/land-cover change as the major driver of the increase in LST (86%). However, it was predicted that farmland and built-up area will still increase within all the villages, while the forest land will decline. As for the complex of secondary and degraded forest, it will decrease in Tsumba kituti, while, in Kiobo and Kisavu, it is expected to increase. Through a combination of remote-sensing and primary data, this study provides accurate information that will benefit decision-makers to implement appropriate landscape-planning techniques to mitigate the effect of the increased land-surface temperature in the villages.",land-surface temperature,land-use/land-cover change,Luki Biosphere Reserve,CA-Markov chain,,,,"Lubalega, Tolerant","Chen, Chen","Kachaka Sudi Kaiko, Claude",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fragmentation was analyzed through FRAGSTATS with forest; shrubland and orchard (SO); and agriculture and clearing (AC) as class types. Results showed that the most significant change in the landscape was in the year 2010 with AC significantly increasing its area and aggregation causing other class types to exhibit more fragmentation. Forest and SO covers displayed huge losses indicated by decreased class area and average size of patches accompanied by a more subdivided landscape shown by their increased number of patches. Although forest and SO slightly recovered in the class area in 2016, values were far from recovering to 2001 values. FRAGSTATS data suggest lowering biodiversity values and paying importance to reserve size in the maintenance of species diversity. The edge effect as a result of class and landscape fragmentation in forest vegetation might have been reduced at the landscape level as indicated by the reduced fractal dimension, as well as sustaining patch cohesion and increased clumpiness. However, abatement of edge effect could be easily limited and reversed if the reduction of the total area of forest available in the landscape continues.",biodiversity,fragmentation,geographic information system,land cover,land use,,,"Carandang, Myrna G.","Rebancos, Carmelita M.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this sense, three land cover/land use maps related to the study area were primarily generated using satellite image data for the period 2006, 2011, and 2017. They were used as a basis to define two scenarios: business-as-usual (BAU) scenario and participatory plausible scenario (PPS) for 2028. Afterwards, the necessary input data used in running of both models were prepared and, then, the outputs of the models were interpreted and compared. According to the results, while human-made coverage and low-density grasslands increased by about 74% and 12%, respectively, it was from 2006 to 2017 that agricultural lands, gardens, and high-density grasslands decreased by 42%, 34%, and 7%, respectively. According to the business-as-usual scenario, which was projected using the LCM model, the increase in human-made cover will continue by about 29% by 2028, and the reduction rate of agricultural lands, gardens, and low-dense and dense grasslands will experience decrease by about 20%, 3%, 11%, and 9%, respectively.

This research shows that Walktrap, Spinglass and Fastgreedy algorithms are able to identify land use communities but with different spatial properties. Community detection algorithms, arising from graph theory and networks science, offer methods for merging sub-objects based on the properties of the network. The use of an explicitly geographical network also identifies some limitations to network partitioning methods such as Spinglass that introduce a degree of randomness in their search for community structure. The results show such algorithms may not be suitable for analysing geographic networks whose structure reflects topological relationships between objects.

A total of 336 material combinations were developed using various material alternatives in addition to different land use ratios. Therefore, the effect of different land cover materials used in the settlements on surface runoff volume was also evaluated. Study requirements were taken into consideration when choosing the calculation method, and the Rational Method, often preferred for calculating surface runoff volumes in small urban basins, was chosen. According to the calculation results obtained from the settlements developed for this study, surface runoff volume can be reduced by 37.10% by increasing only the green space ratio and by 67.65 % by using different material alternatives in the same settlement. Additionally, it was observed that each improvement made to reduce surface runoff in settlements resulted in a positive change.",Urban Form,Land use,Land cover material,Surface runoff,Stormwater management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The area is characterized by complex landscape changes that were caused by different drivers, either natural or anthropogenic, interacting with each other, and resulting in multiple consequences. Two biophysical variables, NDVI, positively correlated with vegetation cover, and albedo, positively correlated with cover of exposed sands, were computed from a time series of merged NOAA-AVHRR and MODIS images (1981 to 2010). Generally, throughout the study period, NDVI increased and albedo decreased. Improved understanding of spatial and temporal dynamics of these environmental processes was achieved by using the Change Vector Analysis (CVA) technique applied to NDVI and albedo data extracted from four sets of consecutive Landsat images, several years apart. Changes were detected for each time step, as well as over the entire period (1978 to 2007). Four categories of land cover were created-vegetation, exposed sands, water bodies and wetlands. The CVA's direction and magnitude enable detecting and quantifying finer changes compared to separate NDVI or albedo difference/ratio images and result in pixel-based maps of the change. Each of the four categories has a biophysical meaning that was validated in selected hot-spots, employing very high spatial resolution images (e. g., Ikonos). Selection of images, taking into account inter and intra annual variability of rainfall, enables differentiating between short-term conservancies (e. g., drought) and long-term alterations. NDVI and albedo, although comparable to tasseled cap's brightness and greenness indices, have the advantage of being computed using reflectance values extracted from various Landsat platforms since the early 1970s. It is shown that, over the entire study period, the majority of the Mu Us Sandy Land area remained unchanged. Part of the area (6%), mainly in the east, was under human-induced rehabilitation processes, in terms of increasing vegetation cover. In other areas (5.1%), bare sands were found to expand to the central-north and the southwest of the area.",change vector analysis,Landsat,desertification,sandification,land-use land-cover change,NDVI,albedo,"Panov, Natalya","Yan, Feng",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mu Us Sandy Land,China,,,,,,,,,,

The present study attempts to understand the consequences of existing changing patterns of climate and LULC on the hydrology of the Usri watershed. Different water balance components were simulated using a semi-distributed Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. Sixteen scenarios were generated using combinations of four periods of climatic data (1974-84; 1985-1995; 1996-2006 and 2007-2016) and four sets of land use maps (1976; 1989; 2000 and 2014). The SWAT model performed well for monthly stream flows during calibration and validation. The study finds that the individual impact of LULC change contributes to increase in the streamflow and decrease in evapotranspiration (ET) primarily due to increase in urbanization and decrease in water bodies, forest cover and barren land of Usri watershed. The combined impact of climatic variations and land use change reveals complex interactions. The study provides insight into hydrological response to variations in climate and land use changes in Usri watershed in recent decades.

The main objectives of this study were focused on monitoring land cover changes particularly for the mangrove forest in the Pichavaram area using multi-temporal Landsat images captured in the 1991, 2000, and 2009. The land use/land cover (LULC) estimation was done by a unique hybrid classification approach consisting of unsupervised and support vector machine (SVM)-based supervised classification. Once the vegetation and non-vegetation classes were separated, training site-based classification technology i.e., SVM-based supervised classification technique was used. The agricultural area, forest/plantation, degraded mangrove and mangrove forest layers were separated from the vegetation layer. Mud flat, sand/beach, swamp, sea water/sea, aquaculture pond, and fallow land were separated from non-vegetation layer. Water logged areas were delineated from the area initially considered under swamp and sea water-drowned areas. In this study, the object-based post-classification comparison method was employed for detecting changes. In order to evaluate the performance, an accuracy assessment was carried out using the randomly stratified sampling method, assuring distribution in a rational pattern so that a specific number of observations were assigned to each category on the classified image. The Kappa accuracy of SVM classified image was highest (94.53 %) for the 2000 image and about 94.14 and 89.45 % for the 2009 and 1991 images, respectively.

In Bangladesh, coastal erosion is a regularly occurring and major destructive process, impacting both human and ecological systems at sea level. The Lower Meghna estuary, located in southern Bangladesh, is among the most vulnerable landscapes in the world to the impacts of coastal erosion. Erosion causes population displacement, loss of productive land area, loss of infrastructure and communication systems, and, most importantly, household livelihoods. With an aim to assess the impacts of historical and predicted shoreline change on different land use and land cover, this study estimated historical shoreline movement, predicted shoreline positions based on historical data, and quantified and assessed past land use and land cover change. Multi-temporal Landsat images from 1988-2021 were used to quantify historical shoreline movement and past land use and land cover. A time-series classification of historical land use and land cover (LULC) were produced to both quantify LULC change and to evaluate the utility of the future shoreline predictions for calculating amounts of lost or newly added land resources by LULC type. Our results suggest that the agricultural land is the most dominant land cover/use (76.04% of the total land loss) lost over the studied period. Our results concluded that the best performed model for predicting land loss was the 10-year time depth and 20-year time horizon model. The 10-year time depth and 20-year time horizon model was also most accurate for agricultural, forested, and inland waterbody land use/covers loss prediction.

In this study, our goal was to quantify the extent of land use influence on river water quality at two catchments in rural North Wales, Conwy and Clwyd. Stream water samples were collected bi-weekly from five sampling sites over a three-month period (September-November 2018) and analyzed in the laboratory to measure six water quality variables, namely, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), phosphorus, nitrate and ammonium concentrations, and bacterial coliform count. We then quantified their relationships with dominant land cover of the contributing catchments using two different land cover classification systems. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed across the sampling sites for pH, EC, nitrate and phosphorus concentration, and coliform count. Strong correlations were observed between pH and the proportion of Acid Grassland, and between nitrate levels and the proportion of Improved Grassland in the catchment. The presence of high-quality agricultural land correlated positively with nitrate and phosphorus concentrations and bacterial coliform count. Conversely, dominance of poor quality agricultural land correlated with lower levels of all the measured water quality indicators.

Major improvements of OPTINC compared to a typical immune network-based classification model (aiNet) include (1) preservation of the best antibodies of each land cover class from the antibody population suppression, which ensures that each land cover class is represented by at least one antibody; (2) mutation rates being self-adaptive according to the model performance between training generations, which improves the model convergence: and (3) incorporation of both Euclidean distance and spectral angle mapping distance to measure affinity between two feature vectors using a genetic algorithm-based optimization, which helps the model to better discriminate LULC classes with similar characteristics. OPTINC was evaluated using two sites with different remote sensing data: a residential area in Denver, CO with high-spatial resolution QuickBird image and LiDAR data, and a suburban area in Monticello, UT with HyMap hyperspectral imagery. A decision tree, a multilayer feed-forward back-propagation neural network, and aiNet were also tested for comparison. Classification accuracy, local homogeneity of classified images, and model sensitivity to training sample size were examined. OPTINC outperformed the other models with higher accuracy and more spatially cohesive land cover classes with limited salt-and-pepper noise.

This study is concentrated on assessing the effect of land use/cover change on the hydrology of the Borkena watershed. The study was examined by Arc GIS10.3. SWAT model used with GIS to assess the impact of land use and land cover change on streamflow. For this study, SWAT Calibration and Uncertainty Procedures (SWAT-CUP) was selected to do sensitivity analysis, calibration, and validation. The temporal change in land use/cover was analyzed for the years 1986, 2000, and 2011. Analysis of land cover changes showed that agricultural land increased from 18.64 to 49.75%, still as urban areas from 1.16 to 10.17% between 1986 and 2011.

One direction is the expansion of farmlands at the expense of the natural vegetation, and the other direction is expansion of plantation forest on farm and grazing lands. But, the net effect of land use land cover change is not as such clear. A clear understudying of such dynamics in land use land cover and the net effect of the change helps design effective land use planning policy, which enhances sustainable natural resources management. Accordingly, the study analyzed intensity of land use land cover change for three-time periods (1990-2000; 2000-2010 and 2010-2020). The findings of this study can be applicable to different parts of the globe where two contrasting directions of change in land use land cover exist. The study employed both qualitative and quantitative methods, which were specifically applied through carrying out step-by-step: satellite image acquisition, preprocessing, classification, accuracy assessment, and intensity analysis. Result of the analysis indicated that land use land cover change over the three intervals showed considerable variation where intensity was consistently increasing from the first (1990-2000) interval to the subsequent (2000-2010) interval, and it was fast (8.24%) during the third interval (2010-2020). The analysis also indicated considerably high transition from bare land to grazing land and bush land during the third interval, especially on areas where the community practiced controlled management of grazing lands (zero grazing) and protection of bush lands. From the total bare land cover in 2010, 21% converted to grazing land and 17% converted to bush land. LULC transition from bush land to cultivated land was rising due to encroachment of bush lands by farming. Transition from bush land to cultivated land increased by 4%, 16% and 50% in the period 1990-2000, 2000-2010, and 2010-2020, respectively. On the other hand, transition from cultivated land to forest land was considerably high during the third interval. From the total cultivated land cover in 2010, 25% converted to forest land, where the change is mainly associated to the introduction of woodlot plantation on individual farmland holdings.

These fluxes are a function of land use and land management and as such an essential component for integrated water resources management. Spatially distributed land use and land cover (LULC) maps distinguishing not only natural land cover but also management practices such as irrigation are therefore essential for comprehensive water management analysis in a river basin. Through remote sensing, LULC can be classified using its unique phenological variability observed over time. For this purpose, sixteen LULC types have been classified in the Upper Pangani River Basin (the headwaters of the Pangani River Basin in Tanzania) using MODIS vegetation satellite data. Ninety-four images based on 8 day temporal and 250 m spatial resolutions were analyzed for the hydrological years 2009 and 2010. Unsupervised and supervised clustering techniques were utilized to identify various LULC types with aid of ground information on crop calendar and the land features of the river basin. Ground truthing data were obtained during two rainfall seasons to assess the classification accuracy.

A.",Flood susceptibility mapping based on watershed geomorphometric characteristics and land use/land cover on a small island,GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM,2024,1,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Flooding is the most frequent hydrological disaster which greatly impacts humans and the environment. Lombok, a small tropical island, experiences severe flooding almost yearly. Flood susceptibility mapping is important to determine the priority watershed in implementing flood mitigation action, including improving the spatial planning in watershed management. Several methods of determining flood susceptibility require the support of long data series and a variety of monitoring equipment in the field where not every region has the resource capacity. Compared to other methods that require the support of long data series and a large number of evenly distributed monitoring equipment, the geomorphometric parameters and land use/cover in a watershed are closely related to the hydrological responses and are potentially applicable in flood susceptibility mapping. This research aimed to classify the watershed flood susceptibility on a small island based on the geomorphometric characteristics and land use/land cover of the watershed. METHODS: This study was carried out on Lombok Island, located in southern Indonesia, representing a small island in the tropical region. Watershed classification was carried out using 24 geomorphometric variables and land use/land cover, representing aspects of the river network, geometry, texture, and watershed relief. The principal component analysis approach was carried out to determine the most significant variable, and the weight of each variable was determined using the weighted sum approach method. Then, compound values were calculated based on the weighted values and preliminary ranking to indicate the flood susceptibility levels, which were divided into five classes. FINDINGS: The analysis found that the variables most related to flood events are the total number of rivers, relief ratio, elongation ratio, river density, stream frequency, and dry agricultural land use. These most related geomorphometrics indicate that the watersheds with higher flood susceptibility have low rock permeability, relatively low infiltration capacity, and relatively high surface runoff, thus triggering flooding. The flood susceptibility mapping classified 16 watersheds as having very high flood susceptibility. This research shows that analysis of the geomorphometric characteristics and land use/land cover can be relied upon to determine the flood susceptibility level, which is useful in spatial planning and flood disaster mitigation. CONCLUSION: Geomorphometric characteristics and land use/land cover can be used to determine a watershed's hydrological characteristics or behaviour. Based on the geomorphometric characteristics of the watersheds on Lombok Island, some identifying variables that are highly related to flood processes were obtained. Based on these characteristics, watersheds with high and very high flood susceptibility levels have low rock permeability, relatively low potential infiltration capacity, and relatively high surface runoff potential. Flooding still occurs despite good forest cover because the geomorphometric characteristics of the watershed also play a major role in flood events.",Flood susceptibility,Hydrological response,Geomorphometrics,Land use/land cover,,,,"Siregar, C.

Spectral and geographic variables were used as inputs to classification tree regression analysis (CART) to find ""rules"" which defined land use and land cover classes on the landscape. The resulting CART functions were used to map land cover and land use across seven Landsat TM scenes for 1995. We then used a thresholding technique to identify locations that differed in spectral properties between the 1995 and 1985 time periods. These ""changed"" locations were classified using CART functions derived from spectral and geographic data from 1985. This was similarly done for the year 1975 based on Landsat MSS data. Differences between the 1975, 1985, and 1995 maps. were considered change in land cover and use. We calibrated and tested the accuracy of our models using data acquired through manual interpretation of aerial photos. Elevation and vegetative indices derived from the remotely sensed satellite imagery explained the most variance in the land use and land cover classes (i.e., defined the ""rules"" most often). Overall accuracies from our study were good, ranging from 94% at the coarsest level of detail to 74% at the finest. The largest changes over the study period were the increases in burned, urban, and mixed conifer-herbaceous classes and decreases in woody deciduous, mixed woody deciduous-herbaceous, and conifer habitats. These changes have important implications for ecological function and biodiversity. The expansion of mixed conifer classes may increase fuel loads and enhance risk to the growing number of rural homes.

Results are presented from a detailed land use and cover change (LUCC) study in the Niah River catchment using satellite imagery, questionnaire surveys and interviews. Successive waves of land cover changes have taken place. Large forest areas have been logged and gradually replaced by oil palm plantations, which now occupy more than 40 per cent of the total land area in the catchment. Concurrently, small-scale farming systems have also changed. Formerly dominant Iban shifting cultivation practices are increasingly being replaced by cash crop production on permanent fields and impacted by off-farm activities involving many ethnic groups. It is argued that land cover changes are continuous and complex processes involving a large number of variables which can be analysed for different time periods at various scales.",land cover changes,land use change,driving forces,remote sensing,GIS,Sarawak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the validation results, the accuracy of LULC and LST outputs were more than 94.6% and 80.0%, respectively. The results show that the current trend of urban growth continues at a rate of 0.16% per year, and the area experienced an LST increase of 2 degrees C between 2009 and 2019.

Agricultural intensification to feed the growing rural population, livestock pressure on native vegetation, and climate change converge to exacerbate soil erosion, creating a significant threat to crop productivity and rural livelihoods. Farmer trainings can be a potent strategy to increase farmer awareness of the larger causes of soil loss, help farmers adapt to or mitigate environmental challenges, and improve crop outputs and incomes. However, evaluations of farmer training programs rarely assess socioeconomic and environmental outcomes simultaneously. Our study uses multiple methods to estimate the socio-ecological effects of a soil and water conservation training program for farmers implemented by ADHENO Integrated Rural Development Association, an Ethiopian non-governmental organization. We asked: (a) did farmers use practices taught in trainings; (b) did these strategies lead to improved agricultural productivity or livelihoods; and (c) how did land-use intensity change in areas with more participation in farmer trainings? To address questions (a) and (b), our study and results are based on 449 household surveys, collected between June and August 2017, in two rural kebeles in Ethiopia in which ADHENO has been active since 2003. We used remote sensing analysis of high resolution satellite images to measure land-use change over a period of nine years, addressing question (c) for one of the kebeles. Analysis of household surveys with propensity score matching and robustness checks suggests that participation in farmer trainings predicts the implementation of four out of seven soil conservation farming methods. Participants in training sessions also had higher average incomes from agriculture than non-participants. Linear models of land-use change in the area around villages did not depict a clear relationship between participation in farmer trainings and change in land-use intensity. These results indicate that farmer trainings focusing on soil and water conservation have the potential to influence farming practices and livelihoods and have implications for soil conservation efforts in the Ethiopian Highlands.

This study analyzed the land use and land cover (LULC) dynamics of city of Dhaka over the past three decades (1990-2020) to evaluate the impact of LULC on ecosystem services value (ESV). The estimation of ESV in relation to LULC has been done using the globally used benefits transfer method (BTM). Findings of the study show that built-up area has increased by 188.35% from 1990 to 2020, with an average annual growth rate is about 6.28%The analysis of ESV shows that it has decreased by 59.55% (85 million USD) from 142.72 million USD in 1990 to 57.72 million USD in 2020 due to the development of the built-up area through conversion of agricultural land, waterbodies, and forest and vegetation land. This study also identified that waterbodies are the greatest contributor to ESV. The result on the elasticity of ESV in relation to LULC implies that about 1% transition in LULC would result in about 0.33% change in total ESV during the study period.

We investigated how the parametrization of LULCC and of organic matter decomposition, as well as initial land cover, affects the historical and future carbon fluxes in an Earth System Model (ESM). Using the land component of the Max Planck Institute ESM, we found that the historical (1750-2010) LULCC flux varied up to 25% depending on the fraction of biomass which enters the atmosphere directly due to burning or is used in short-lived products. The uncertainty in the decadal LULCC fluxes of the recent past due to the parametrization of decomposition and direct emissions was 0.6PgCyr(-1), which is 3 times larger than the uncertainty previously attributed to model and method in general. Preindustrial natural land cover had a larger effect on decadal LULCC fluxes than the aforementioned parameter sensitivity (1.0PgCyr(-1)). Regional differences between reconstructed and dynamically computed land covers, in particular, at low latitudes, led to differences in historical LULCC emissions of 84-114PgC, globally. This effect is larger than the effects of forest regrowth, shifting cultivation, or climate feedbacks and comparable to the effect of differences among studies in the terminology of LULCC.

The objectives are 1) to analyse the mean temperature for each land cover types and 2) to analyse the relationship of temperature variation within land cover types: built up area, green area, forest, water bodies and bare land.

However, built up-bare land did not show significant impact at p < 0.05.

The study explores the dynamic land use land cover changes and associated land expropriations from peri-urban farmers in the rapidly growing Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The study utilized a time series of global land cover and land-use change datasets (GLAD) covering the years 2000-2020. Moreover, empirical data is gathered through a household survey conducted among 349 systematically selected expropriated farmers across four sub-cities of Addis Ababa. The findings underscore a profound shift in the city's land use and land cover over the past two decades. The built-up area emerges as the predominant land cover, witnessing a substantial increase of 25.28% (13,150.30 ha) over the past two decades. Concurrently, agricultural land and vegetation cover decreased by 15.92% and 9.35%, respectively, indicating a significant outward expansion of the city. This expansive growth, driven by the city's rapid development, has resulted in extensive land expropriations primarily affecting peri-urban farmers. The expropriations were mainly for housing, investment, industrial parks, and infrastructure development. Thus, we urge the city administration to carefully manage the horizontal expansion of built-up areas at the expense of the agricultural land and vegetation cover.

The objective of this paper is to review the different modelling approaches that have been used in land-use/land-cover change research from the perspective of their utility for the study and prediction of changes in land-use intensification. After clarifying the main concepts used, the different modelling approaches that have been used to study land-use change are examined, case study evidence on processes and drivers of land-use intensification are discussed, and a conclusion is provided on the present ability to predict changes in land-use intensity. The analysis suggests there are differences in the capability of different modelling approaches to assess changing levels of intensification: dynamic, process-based simulation models appear to be better suited to predict changes in land-use intensity than empirical, stochastic or static optimisation models. However, some stochastic and optimisation methods may be useful in describing the decision-making processes that drive land management. Case study evidence highlight the uncertainties and surprises inherent in the processes of land-use intensification. This can both inform model development and reveal a wider range of possible futures than is evident from modelling alone. Case studies also highlight the importance of decision-making by land managers when facing a range of response options. Thus, the ability to model decision-making processes is probably more important in land-use intensification studies then the broad category of model used. For this reason, landscape change models operating at an aggregated level have not been used to predict intensification. In the future, an integrated approach to modelling - that is multidisciplinary and cross-sectoral combining elements of different modelling techniques - will probably best serve the objective of improving understanding of land-use change processes including intensification. This is because intensification is a function of the management of physical resources, within the context of the prevailing social and economic drivers. Some of the factors that should be considered when developing future land-use change models are: the geographic and socio-economic context of a particular study, the spatial scale and its influence on the modelling approach, temporal issues such as dynamic versus equilibrium models, thresholds and surprises associated with rapid changes, and system feedbacks. In industrialised regions, predicting land-use intensification requires a better handling of the links between the agriculture and forestry sectors to the energy sector, of technological innovation, and of the impact of agri-environment policies. For developing countries, better representation of urbanisation and its various impacts on land-use changes at rural-urban interfaces, of transport infrastructure and market change will be required. Given the impossibility of specific predictions of these driving forces, most of the modelling work will be aimed at scenario analysis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Inclusion of a nitrogen (N) cycle in models is fairly recent and strongly affects carbon (C) fluxes. In this study, for the first time, we use a model with C and N dynamics with three distinct historical reconstructions of land-use and land-use change (LULUC) to quantify LULUC emissions and uncertainty that includes the integrated effects of not only climate and CO2 but also N. The modeled global average emissions including N dynamics for the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000-2005 were 1.8 +/- 0.2, 1.7 +/- 0.2, and 1.4 +/- 0.2GtCyr(-1), respectively, (mean and range across LULUC data sets).

Compared to previous studies that did not include N dynamics, modeled net LULUC emissions were higher, particularly in the non tropics. In the model, N limitation reduces regrowth rates of vegetation in temperate areas resulting in higher net emissions. Our results indicate that exclusion of N dynamics leads to an underestimation of LULUC emissions by around 70% in the non tropics, 10% in the tropics, and 40% globally in the 1990s. The differences due to inclusion/exclusion of the N cycle of 0.1GtCyr(-1) in the tropics, 0.6GtCyr(-1) in the non tropics, and 0.7GtCyr(-1) globally (mean across land-cover data sets) in the 1990s were greater than differences due to the land-cover data in the non tropics and globally (0.2GtCyr(-1)).

The study revealed that changes in the spatial pattern of land use/land cover types, together with the effect of changing vegetation patterns, have a significant impact on carbon storage and habitat quality. While reductions in shrubland and forests were detrimental, transformations from openspaces to them, particularly at their boundaries, enhanced the capacity of carbon storage and habitat quality. On the other hand, even though the scenarios of ecosystem service-based development and economy-based development were based on the economic value of ecosystem services and the value of products/services obtained from different land use/land cover types, respectively, the ecosystem service-based development scenario was characterized by more effective land use/land cover management in terms of maximizing both the economic and ecological benefits.

In recent decades, Chaiyaphum province has experienced a problem with flooding almost every year. In particular, the flood in 2010 caused property damage of 495 million Baht, more than 322,000 persons were affected, and approximately 1046.4 km(2) of productive agricultural area was affected. Therefore, this study examined how to optimize land use and land cover allocation for flood mitigation using land use change and hydrological models with optimization methods. This research aimed to allocate land use and land cover (LULC) to minimize the surface for flood mitigation in Mueang Chaiyaphum district, Chaiyaphum province, Thailand. The research methodology consisted of six stages: data collection and preparation, LULC classification, LULC prediction, surface runoff estimation, the optimization of LULC allocation for flood mitigation and mapping, and economic and ecosystem service value evaluation and change. According to the results of the optimization and mapping of suitable LULC allocation to minimize surface runoff for flood mitigation in dry, normal, and wet years using goal programming and the CLUE-S model, the suitable LULC allocation for flood mitigation in 2049 under a normal year could provide the highest future economic value and gain. In the meantime, the suitable LULC allocation for flood mitigation in 2049 under a drought year could provide the highest ecosystem service value and gain. Nevertheless, considering future economic and ecosystem service values and changes with surface runoff reduction, the most suitable LULC allocation for flood mitigation is a normal year. Consequently, it can be concluded that the derived results of this study can be used as primary information for flood mitigation project implementation. Additionally, the presented conceptual framework and research workflows can be used as a guideline for government agencies to examine other flood-prone areas for flood mitigation in Thailand.",optimizing land use and land cover allocation,surface runoff coefficient,goal programming,random forests,SCS-CN model,CLUE-S model,Chaiyaphum province,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Thailand,,,,,,,,,,,

Many of the available hydrological models divide the watershed into Hydrological Response Units (HRU), which are spatial units with expected similar hydrological behaviours. The division into HRU's requires good-quality spatial data on land use/land cover. This paper presents different approaches to attain an optimal land use/land cover map based on remote sensing imagery for a Himalayan watershed in northern India. First digital classifications using maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) and a decision tree classifier were applied. The results obtained from the decision tree were better and even improved after post classification sorting. But the obtained land use/land cover map was not sufficient for the delineation of HRUs, since the agricultural land use/land cover class did not discriminate between the two major crops in the area i.e. paddy and maize. Subsequently the digital classification on fused data (ASAR and ASTER) were attempted to map land use/land cover classes with emphasis to delineate the paddy and maize crops but the supervised classification over fused datasets did not provide the desired accuracy and proper delineation of paddy and maize crops. Eventually, we adopted a visual classification approach on fused data. This second step with detailed classification system resulted into better classification accuracy within the 'agricultural land' class which will be further combined with topography and soil type to derive HRU's for physically-based hydrological modeling.",Land use/land cover,decision tree,maximum likelihood classification,image fusion,hydrological modeling,Himalayan watershed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the last decades, forest cover in this area has decreased dramatically from 63% to 34%. Previously, cleared lands have been largely converted into rubber plantations. The valleys have a tropical monsoon climate and the hills are subtropical. The study combined remote sensing analyses with secondary data and in-field interviews in order to understand the coupling between land use and land cover changes, and farmer vulnerability in light of the geographic, historical, and sociopolitical situation. This project integrated the development of socioeconomic and spatial databases with information collected through household interview, land use and land cover mapping, and policy reviews. After interpretation, the overlays were digitized and registered to the UTM coordinate system and WGS 84 datum using 60 control points obtained from the 1:50,000 scale topographic maps. The digitized land units were attributed in the GIS according to the six classes assigned during the interpretation. Through an analysis of the sociopolitical situation, this study has shown how upland resources, people, and space are dominated by the state and by lowland-based monoculture-cropping technologies. Furthermore, the greater part of benefits derived from the exploitation of mountain resources flowed down to lowland economies and political centers. Challenges exist for both state and lowland institutions to design policies and marketing systems that are more transparent for indigenous people and that are more supportive of indigenous knowledge, cultures, and livelihoods. This can be achieved through decentralized state policies, transparent markets, capacity building, and participatory land use planning at local and watershed levels. Capacity building for indigenous people to enable them to cope with environmental variability and socioeconomic changes can be achieved through endowment, empowerment, entitlement, and enfranchisement. These provide a counterbalance to the ongoing political-economic processes that produce vulnerability.

As a result, the systematic generation of annual regional, national, and global LULC map products derived from the classification of satellite imagery data have become critical inputs for multiple scientific disciplines. The importance of quantifying pixel-level uncertainty to improve the robustness of downstream analyses has long been acknowledged but this practice is still not widely adopted in the generation of these LULC products. The lack of uncertainty quantification is likely due to the fact that most approaches that have been put forward for this task are too computationally intensive for large-scale analysis (e.g., bootstrapping). In this article, we describe how conformal statistics can be used to quantify pixel-level uncertainty in a way that is not computationally intensive, is statistically rigorous despite relying on few assumptions, and can be used together with any classification algorithm that produces class probabilities. Our simulation results show how the size of the predictive sets created by conformal statistics can be used as an indicator of classification uncertainty at the pixel level. Our analysis based on data from the Brazilian Amazon reveals that both forest and water have high certainty whereas pasture and the ""natural (other)"" category have substantial uncertainty. This information can guide additional ground-truth data collection and the resulting raster combining the LULC classification with the uncertainty results can be used to communicate in a transparent way to downstream users which classified pixels have high or low uncertainty.

Airborne hyperspectral images are among those data which perfectly suits to that kind of applications because of their high number of spectral bands and the ability to see small details on the field. As this technology has newly developed, most of the image processing methods are for the medium resolution sensors and they are not capable of dealing with high resolution images. Therefore, in this study a new framework is proposed to improve the classification accuracy of land use/cover mapping applications and to achieve a greater reliability in the process of mapping land use map using high resolution hyperspectral image data. In order to achieve it, spatial information is incorporated together with spectral information by exploiting feature extraction methods like Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Gabor and Morphological Attribute Profile (MAP) on dimensionally reduced image with highest accuracy. Then, machine learning algorithms like Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used to investigate the contribution of texture information in the classification of high resolution hyperspectral images. In addition to that, further analysis is conducted with object based RF classification to investigate the contribution of contextual information. Finally, overall accuracy, producer's/user's accuracy, the quantity and allocation based disagreements and location and quantity based kappa agreements are calculated together with McNemar tests for the accuracy assessment. According to our results, proposed framework which incorporates Gabor texture information and exploits Discrete Wavelet Transform based dimensionality reduction method increase the overall classification accuracy up to 9%.

Supervised random forest machine learning classification algorithm was applied to classify and examine the dynamics of land use changes in the study area. Markov chain simulation was adopted to examine the magnitude of transition of land cover changes. The results of the study revealed a substantial change in land cover uses in the study area over the period (2006-2020). The trend analysis in area percentage changes indicated that natural forest and deciduous forest land had reduced drastically mainly for the purpose of agriculture production and build-ups for human settlement as revealed by the negative change or reduction in typical biodiversity hotspot reservations: natural forest (-22.71%), deciduous forest (-26.74%) and water bodies (-32.11%) with a positive change in components such as built-up area (29.11%), barren land (4.96) and agriculture (37.91) in the study area. The study, however, revealed serious trend in water bodies extinction within the municipality as indicated by the dynamic change analysis results, suggesting that 7.86 km2 area that was originally under water pathways have been converted for human settlement and 0.76 km2 of agriculture lands are exposed to erosion (barren land). A Markov chain simulation prediction of the transition for the year 2032 revealed a positive probability increasing rate in urban and surface build-up and agriculture at a rate of 2.33% and 1.69%, respectively, with substantive reduction in natural biodiversity resources in future given the present scenario. Given the dynamics of LULC changes, we recommend that major stakeholders including environmental protection agency, forest guides, Ghana water company and municipal assembly authorities should develop feasibility holistic preventive measures that seek to ensure effective and efficient utilization of resources and promote the livelihood of individuals who depend on these resources for survival.",Remote sensing data,Markov chain simulation,land use change and land cover changes,supervised random forest algorithm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assessed the effect of nineteenth-century agricultural legacies for contemporary agricultural abandonment by integrating historic maps and satellite imagery in the Carpathian region. We modeled the choice of agricultural land, and the legacies of Habsburg and Socialist regimes, while controlling for agro-ecological, accessibility and sociopolitical variation. Farming during the Habsburg era was concentrated in agro-ecologically suitable areas, but socialist agricultural expansion occurred mostly in less suitable areas, leading to subsequent abandonment. In addition, our results showed that historic land use affected abandonment even 100 years later. Although legacies diminished over time, their effects were amplified when political transformations occurred, likely due to land tenure systems, land owner attitudes, cultural values and differences in land improvement over time.

We apply a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) consisting of a land cover and a land use layer. In the land cover layer of the CRF, the nodes represent super-pixels; in the land use layer, the nodes correspond to objects from a geospatial database. Intra-layer edges of the CRF model spatial dependencies between neighbouring image sites. All spatially overlapping sites in both layers are connected by inter-layer edges, which leads to higher order cliques modelling the semantic relation between all land cover and land use sites in the clique. A generic formulation of the higher order potential is proposed. In order to enable efficient inference in the two-layer higher order CRF, we propose an iterative inference procedure in which the two classification tasks mutually influence each other. We integrate contextual relations between land cover and land use in the classification process by using contextual features describing the complex dependencies of all nodes in a higher order clique. These features are incorporated in a discriminative classifier, which approximates the higher order potentials during the inference procedure. The approach is designed for input data based on aerial images. Experiments are carried out on two test sites to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The experiments show that the classification results are improved compared to the results of a non-contextual classifier. For land cover classification, the result is much more homogeneous and the delineation of land cover segments is improved. For the land use classification, an improvement is mainly achieved for land use objects showing non-typical characteristics or similarities to other land use classes. Furthermore, we have shown that the size of the super-pixels has an influence on the level of detail of the classification result, but also on the degree of smoothing induced by the segmentation method, which is especially beneficial for land cover classes covering large, homogeneous areas.

The release of NLCD 2016 provides important new information on land change patterns across CONUS from 2001 to 2016. For land cover, seven epochs were concurrently generated for years 2001, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2013, and 2016. Products reveal that land cover change is significant across most land cover classes and time periods. The land cover product was validated using existing reference data from the legacy NLCD 2011 accuracy assessment, applied to the 2011 epoch of the NLCD 2016 product line. The legacy and new NLCD 2011 overall accuracies were 82% and 83%, respectively, (standard error (SE) was 0.5%), demonstrating a small but significant increase in overall accuracy. Between 2001 and 2016, the CONUS landscape experienced significant change, with almost 8% of the landscape having experienced a land cover change at least once during this period. Nearly 50% of that change involves forest, driven by change agents of harvest, fire, disease and pests that resulted in an overall forest decline, including increasing fragmentation and loss of interior forest. Agricultural change represented 15.9% of the change, with total agricultural spatial extent showing only a slight increase of 4778 km(2), however there was a substantial decline (7.94%) in pasture/hay during this time, transitioning mostly to cultivated crop. Water and wetland change comprised 15.2% of change and represent highly dynamic land cover classes from epoch to epoch, heavily influenced by precipitation.

However, climatic effects of land management practices have been little discussed and compared to land-use impacts. As land-atmosphere interactions via surface fluxes are particularly strong during the warm season, we investigate the impacts of historical land use and present irrigation practices on summer temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere using the most recent version of Community Earth System Model. Our results suggest that historical land use leads to an overall cooling in the middle latitudes and a warming in the tropics, and the sign and magnitude of the changes in temperature depend on the type of land cover change. On the other hand, summer irrigation leads to a significant cooling over many irrigated areas due to enhanced evapotranspiration, and the local cooling is comparable to and even stronger than the land-use effects. Both land use and irrigation can also significantly influence the intensity and frequency of hot extremes. Land use shows stronger impacts during the night through ground heat flux feedback, while irrigation shows stronger impacts during the day through latent heat flux feedback. Our comparison demonstrates the importance of irrigation in local and regional climate, highlighting the necessity of considering such land management practices in future assessments of regional climate change and climate mitigation.",land use - land cover change,climate modeling,land-atmosphere interaction,irrigation,CESM2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The image differencing showed a positive correlation to the changes in the Land use and Land cover classes. NDVI values reduced from 0.48 to 0.11. The land use change matrix also showed conversion of savannah areas into bare ground and settlement. Open and close savannah reduced from 50.80% to 36.5% and 27.80% to 22.67% respectively whiles bare land and settlement increased. Overall accuracy of classified 2014 image and kappa statistics was 83.20% and 0.761 respectively. The study revealed the declining nature of the vegetation and the significance of using satellite imagery.

One promising approach to derive more informative maps is using fractional cover instead of hard classification. Here, we evaluate the effect of three key data processing options on the performance of random forest (RF) fractional cover models for moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data in a heterogeneous agricultural landscape in a monsoon region: 1) selection of spectral predictor sets [ normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), surface reflectance (SR), and all combined (Full)]; 2) time interval (8-day vs. 16-day); and 3) smoothing (no smoothing versus Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter). Model performance was assessed with spatially stratified rootmean-square error (RMSE), Spearman's rank correlation, and R-2, per LULC type and averaged over all types. We found adequate performance of the best model (avg. rho = 0.62) that used all predictors, 8-day interval and no smoothing. Among the different alternatives, the choice of predictors accounted for 36.3% of the variation, smoothing for 19.0%, and time interval for 17.9%. The intrinsic dimensionalities of the spectral predictors were investigated to complement the variable importance analyses.

We identified land use/land cover types in northern China from 2001 to 2018 with ENVI images and ArcGIS software. Meteorological data were selected from 292 stations in northern China, the potential evapotranspiration was calculated with the Penman-Monteith formula, and reanalysis humidity and observed humidity data were obtained. The reanalysis minus observation (RMO, i.e., the difference between reanalysis humidity and observed humidity) can effectively characterize the impact of different land use/land cover types (forestland, grassland, cultivated land, construction land, water body and unused land) on surface humidity in northern China in the early 21(st) century. The results showed that from 2001 to 2018, the area of forestland expanded (increasing by approximately 1.80x10(4) km(2)), while that of unused land reduced (decreasing by approximately 5.15x10(4) km(2)), and the regional ecological environment was improved. Consequently, land surface in most areas of northern China tended to be wetter. The contributions of land use/land cover types to surface humidity changes were related to the quality of the regional ecological environment. The contributions of the six land use/land cover types to surface humidity were the highest in northeastern region of northern China, with a better ecological environment, and the lowest in northwestern region, with a fragile ecological environment. Surface humidity was closely related to the variation in regional vegetation coverage; when the regional vegetation coverage with positive (negative) contributions expanded (reduced), the land surface became wetter. The positive contributions of forestland and water body to surface humidity were the greatest. Unused land and construction land were associated with the most serious negative contributions to surface humidity. Affected by the regional distribution pattern of vegetation, surface humidity in different seasons decreased from east to west in northern China. The seasonal variation in surface humidity was closely related to the growth of vegetation: surface humidity was the highest in summer, followed by autumn and spring, and the lowest in winter. According to the results, surface humidity is expected to increase in northeastern region of northern China, decrease in northern region, and likely increase in northwestern region.",surface humidity,land use,land cover change,reanalysis minus observation,Penman-Monteith formula,climate change,northern China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately 20% of irrigated areas in the word are threatened by secondary soil salinization. To explore the influence of land use-land cover (LULC) on soil water and salinity in those regions, farmland areas planted with spring-sown wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) or alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), and bare land (CK) in the Qinwangchuan irrigated region of Gansu Province in China were selected as the research objects. The characteristics of surface vegetation (coverage, height, biomass), surface micro-environmental factors (light intensity, soil temperature) and soil physicochemical properties (moisture and salinity) were measured successively for four years, and their changes and quantitative relationships were analyzed. The results showed that the coverage, height, and biomass of surface vegetation (or stubble) under different LULCs in spring and autumn were significantly different (p < 0.05) and ranked as follows: alfalfa field > wheat field > bare land. With the increasing surface vegetation, the surface light intensity and topsoil temperature at a depth of 5 cm indicated decreasing trends; the water content in the 0-5-cm soil layer showed an increasing trend, while that in the 0-40-cm layers displayed the opposite trend; the salinity at depths of 0-5 and 0-40 cm indicated a decreasing trend. Correlation analysis showed that there was a significant negative correlation between the vegetation characteristics and the salinity in the 0-5- and 0-40-cm soil layers (p < 0.01), while opposite correlations were observed between the vegetation characteristics and the water content in the 0-5- and 0-40-cm soil layers. Regression analysis showed that a 1% increase in vegetation coverage would decrease the salinity at depths of 0-5 and 0-40 cm by 2.5 and 1.0 uS.cm(-1), respectively. In summary, farmland planted with spring-sown crops with short growth periods or abandoned in semiarid and arid irrigated regions would gradually experience an increase in soil salinity, whereas the planting of perennial alfalfa could inhibit and lessen soil salt accumulation at depths of 0-5 and 0-40 cm, which is beneficial to improve the soil quality.

This paper presents a large scale analysis of the spatiotemporal structure of Istanbul, a highly urbanized city in Turkey, from 1971 to 2002 using forest cover type maps analysed with geographical information systems (GIS) and a spatial statistics programme. The quantitative evidence indicated that increasing population and expanding urbanization caused drastic changes to the temporal and spatial dynamics of land use/land cover pattern in Istanbul. There was a net increase of 5387.3ha in total forested areas (1.0 per cent) due to mainly reforestation activities even though the population increased three times over a 31-year period. Increase in number of patches and decrease in mean patch size together demonstrated that the landscape developed into a more fragmented structure that would negatively affect biodiversity and the resilience of the ecosystems. In conclusion, plain increase in forest areas may not always be a favourable situation. The quality, composition and the configuration of forest landscape should also be analysed to present the dynamics of ecosystem in terms of ecological and economical sustainability over a longer time and larger area.

Overall, urban land carbon emissions have a strong correlation with the total carbon emissions, and will continue to increase in the future mainly due to the surge of industrialization and urbanization. Furthermore, carbon emission in regions with more developed industrial structures is much higher than in regions with less advanced industrial structures.

The stability of LULC in different types of nature reserves was tracked and identified by extracting land-use change trajectory, and the land-use change trajectory was divided into three types: stable type, sub-stable type and unstable type. The impact of LUCC on regional ecosystem services was studied by using hotspot analysis and gravity center analysis. The results showed that: 1) The LULC in the study area was stable on the whole, and the proportion of stable land area reached 86.08%. The intensity of LUCC showed an increasing trend in recent 20 years, and the conversion of cultivated land and construction land was active in continuous time interval. 2) The stability of LULC in forest ecological reserves and wildlife reserves in the eastern part of Jilin Province was the highest, while that in inland wetland reserves and geological relic reserves in the central and western part of Jilin Province was lower. 3) The LUCC in national nature reserves not only changed the value of its own ecosystem service function, but also affected the ecosystem service function of the whole region. The combination of intensity analysis and land-use change trajectory was used to identify the characteristics of stability of LULC in nature reserves, which was conducive to deeply understand the process of LUCC in national nature reserves and provided reasonable suggestions for regional ecological protection.",national nature reserves,land-use and land-cover change (LUCC),stability,intensity analysis,land-use change trajectory,ecosystem service value,,Li Hong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Airborne hyperspectral images are among those data which perfectly suits to that kind of applications because of their high number of spectral bands and the ability to see small details on the field. As this technology has newly developed, most of the image processing methods are for the medium resolution sensors and they are not capable of dealing with high resolution images. Therefore, in this study a new framework is proposed to improve the classification accuracy of land use/cover mapping applications and to achieve a greater reliability in the process of mapping land use map using high resolution hyperspectral image data. In order to achieve it, spatial information is incorporated together with spectral information by exploiting feature extraction methods like Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Gabor and Morphological Attribute Profile (MAP) on dimensionally reduced image with highest accuracy. Then, machine learning algorithms like Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used to investigate the contribution of texture information in the classification of high resolution hyperspectral images. In addition to that, further analysis is conducted with object based RF classification to investigate the contribution of contextual information. Finally, overall accuracy, producer's/user's accuracy, the quantity and allocation based disagreements and location and quantity based kappa agreements are calculated together with McNemar tests for the accuracy assessment. According to our results, proposed framework which incorporates Gabor texture information and exploits Discrete Wavelet Transform based dimensionality reduction method increase the overall classification accuracy up to 9%. Amongst individual classes, Gabor features boosted classification accuracies of all the classes (soil, road, vegetation, building and shadow) to 7%, 6%, 6%, 8%, 9%, and 24% respectively with producer's accuracy. Besides, 17% and 10% increase obtained in user's accuracy with MAP(area) feature in classifying road and shadow classes respectively.

Provisioning ecosystem services accrued by the populations within the catchment include water, fish, medicinal plants and timber among others. In spite of its importance, the River catchment is under threat from anthropogenic activities and land use change. This paper studies land uses and land cover change in the catchment and how the changes have impacted on the ecosystem services. Landsat 5 and 8 images (1984, 1994, 2005 and 2013) were used to map land cover change and subsequent inventorying of provisioning ecosystem services. Participatory Geographic Information Systems and Focus group discussions were conducted to identify provisioning ecosystems services that communities benefit from the catchment and indicate these on the map.Post classification comparisons indicate that since 1984, there has been a decline in woodlands from 135.3 km(2) in 1984 to 15.5 km(2) in 2013 while urban areas increased from 9.8 km(2) to 23.8 km(2) in 2013. Communities indicated that provisioning ecosystems services such as forest products, wild animals and fruits and medicinal plants have been declining over the years. In addition, evidence of catchment degradation through waste disposal, illegal sand mining, deforestation and farming on marginal lands were observed. Population growth, urbanization and demand for agricultural lands have contributed to this land use and land cover change. The study suggests addressing catchment degradation through integrated method where an ecosystems approach is used. Thus, both the proximate and underlying driving factors of land-use and land cover change need to be addressed in order to sustainably reduce ecosystem degradation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Atmosphere-surface exchange is a major process affecting the cycling of mercury in the global environment and its impacts on food webs. We investigate the sensitivities of the air-surface exchange, atmospheric transport, and budget of mercury to projected 2000-2050 changes in climate and land use/land cover with a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). We find that annual mean Hg(0) dry deposition flux over land could increase by up to 20% in northern mid-latitudes by 2050 due to increased vegetation and foliage density. Climate change can significantly affect both the wet deposition and atmospheric chemistry of mercury. In response to the projected climate change, the annual mean wet deposition flux increases over most continental regions and decreases over most of the mid-latitude and tropical oceans. The annual mean mercury wet deposition flux over northern and southern high latitudes increases by 7% and 8% respectively, largely driven by increases in precipitation there. Surface Hg(0) is predicted to increase generally, because high temperatures decrease Hg(0) oxidation by bromine and high moisture increases aqueous Hg(II) photo reduction.

Consequently, understanding the spatial distribution of land degradation across all scales becomes imperative. This study employed land cover change and soil organic carbon (SOC) stock assessments to analyse land degradation within the eThekwini Municipality beyond the baseline period (2000-2015). Utilizing remote sensing and machine learning techniques, this research examined land degradation within the eThekwini Municipality over the period spanning 2000 to 2022. Landsat 7 (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus - ETM+), Landsat 8 (Operational Land Imager 1 - OLI1), and Landsat 9 (Operational Land Imager 2 - OLI2) images were employed to extract variables for both land cover change and SOC stock prediction through XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models. Among these models, LightGBM demonstrates superior performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 80.646 in land cover predictions and 77.869 in SOC stock predictions. Analysis of land cover change within the eThekwini Municipality unveiled a shift from forests and shrubland landscapes to cropland and built-up areas. This shift results in the municipality encountering losses in SOC stock between 2015 and 2022. The model predicted that most SOC stock losses occur at the 20-50 cm depth (9.27%), in comparison to the 7.21% loss at the 0-20 cm depth. These findings underscore the pivotal role of remote sensing and machine learning in aiding policymakers to assess land degradation and implement pertinent measures to enhance the landscape.",land cover change,degradation,soil organic carbon,machine learning,remote sensing,,,"Mutanga, Onisimo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When cities flourish, vegetated regions are altered into impervious concrete masses. This along with other factors increases the Land Surface Temperature (LST) in urban areas, leading to the emergence of Surface Urban Heat Islands (SUHIs). This study seeks to examine how the evolving patterns of LULC impact the intensity of LST and its correlation with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) in the rapidly expanding Kozhikode Urban Area (KUA). This is studied using a combination of geographic information systems, satellite remote sensing, and statistical analysis. Satellite images of Landsat 5 (TM) and Landsat 8 (OLI & TIRS) of the years 1993 and 2018 were used, respectively. ArcGIS software has been used to map the LULC pattern, LST, NDVI and NDBI. The supervised technique with the maximum likelihood algorithm is used to derive the LULC pattern, while the mono-window algorithm has been used to derive the LST. MS Excel, SPSS, and OrginPro were used for statistical analysis. The results reflect a decrease of 73.88 per cent in total vegetated areas from 1993 to 2018, while the built-up area expanded from 19.95 km2 to 132.96 km2. The mean LST increased by 2.65 degrees C from 1993 to 2018. Pearson correlation revealed LST is negatively correlated with NDVI (r =-0.541, P < 0.5 in 1993, r =-0.616, P < 0.5 in 2018) and positively correlated with NDBI (r = 0.664, P < 0.5 in 1993, r = 0.612, P < 0.5 in 2018). As a result, this paper urges urban planners and policymakers in Kozhikode to urgently address the disproportionate LULC patterns emerging in the city and implement more sustainable development measures and policies like urban greening with proper planning and effective stakeholder engagement to control the rising LST.",Land Use Land Cover Change,Land Surface Temperature,NDVI,NDBI,Landsat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the New Type Urbanization Strategy proposed by the government in 2014, China's mode of urban growth has been transformed from addressing ""quantity"" to ""quality"" in the urbanization process. In this case, the regulation of land use by the Chinese government plays a more important role in urban growth. With their planned land regulatory scheme, the various instruments employed by Chinese governments have quite different mechanisms influencing land prices. However, there are no rigorous studies focusing on the land use regulation system and its impact on land values to date, particular in China. This study seeks to explore how land use regulation affects urban land values through the systematic lens. We summarize the main land use regulatory instruments based on the analysis of China's planned land use system and urban land banking system, including the construction land quota, constraints on the allowed floor area ratio (FAR) of each land transaction parcel, and land supply restrictions. A new dataset based on land transaction data from 2007 to 2016 that covers 286 prefectural cities from the country's coastal, central, and western regions is used in the empirical analysis. The results show that the effects of the floor area ratio (FAR) on land values are significant and positive, with the residential and commercial land supply ratio being a key factor. Moreover, the results imply that the effects of constraints on FAR and commercial land supply vary between regions. These findings indicate that the Chinese land market is considerably distorted by excessive administrative interventions by local governments, in the stage of urban transition guided, the capable regulatory instruments could play an important role in adjusting urban land prices and hence impact on urban growth.",Land use regulation,Land prices,Land supply,Floor area ratio,Urban growth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rapid unplanned urban sprawl has influenced the land use and land cover of the urban area leading to the development of the phenomenon of Urban Heat Island. The present study highlights how land use and land cover changes have impacted the land surface temperature and urban heat islands phenomenon in the greater Imphal city of Manipur in India. The study was carried out with multi-spectral and multi-temporal satellite imageries of 1988, 2000, 2011, and 2021, respectively. The extracted information from the rectified imageries highlights a significant increase in the land surface temperature in the built-up area of the city.

The increase in land surface temperature is directly attributed to the increased built-up area (24.06% to 44.85%) and reduction in the urban forest cover (28.17% to 16.65%). Cumulatively, there is a 2.44 celcius and 1.03 celcius rise in maximum and minimum LST over three decades. The variability in the LST shows positive correlations with the NDBI and negative correlations with NDVI.

The results reveal that the landscape of ACB has changed considerably during the past 25 years between 1985 and 2010.

The basin has become more fragmented and formed less connected patches in 2010 compared to 1985. Rapid population growth, internal migration, policy shifts, and regime change were identified as the key driving forces of LULC changes in ACB. The LULC changes and related trend of increasing landscape fragmentation in the basin increased soil erosion, the volume of surface runoff, and sediment transport in the landscape and, consequently, affected the levels and water quality of the lakes found in the rift floor. Furthermore, the destruction and fragmentation of shrubland and natural grassland led to the decline of wild plants and animals previously prominent in the basin.

In order to explore the impact of LULC changes on rainstorm flood disaster risk in the future, a framework of rainstorm flood disaster risk assessment is constructed from natural-social perspective through LULC simulation based on the patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model in this study. Specifically, the spatial LULC under three future development scenarios (inertia development scenario, economic priority scenario and sustainable development scenario) for the year 2030 is simulated, and then assessment model of rainstorm flood disaster risk is constructed through obtaining inundation depth and social vulnerability based on simulated LULC. Jingdezhen City in China is selected as an example. The results show that proposed risk assessment framework based on PLUS model can be used to detect the risk changes in different development scenarios. The risk of urban rainstorm flood disaster under economic priority scenario is most severe and risk under the sustainable development scenario is the lowest under the same return period rainstorm. Under the sustainable development scenario, green land including forest land, grassland and open water increases, which reduces the surface runoff and decrease the risk of rainstorm flood disaster effectively, however the reduction is limited with the greater rainstorm return period. Therefore, adaptive measures should be implemented together with land use planning to prevent and control urban flood risk.

However, the practical implications of such systems are still limited due to the lack of high-frequency data and uncertainties associated with predicting complex systems such as ecosystems. This study aims to investigate the potential of time series analysis of remote sensing data in detecting signals of reduced resilience in mangrove forest ecosystems. Using time series analysis of remote sensing images, the resilience of mangrove forests was explored across two distinct study sites. One site (Qeshm Island) has been adversely affected by land-use and land-cover changes, while the other (Gabrik) serves as a reference ecosystem. The study uses data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite to quantify three remotely sensed indices: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), and the Modified Vegetation Water Ratio (MVWR). In addition, Landsat data has been used to explore temporal alterations in land-use and land-cover change. To identify signals of reduced resilience, trend analyses of indicators such as autocorrelation (acf (1)) and standard deviation (SD) are applied. The findings revealed a notable decrease in resilience, signaled by significant upward trends in NDVI statistical metrics for Qeshm Island (Kendall's tau of acf (1): 0.50 and SD: 0.90), contrasting with the pattern observed in Gabrik (Kendall's tau of acf (1): -0.19 and SD: -0.19). These results align with our expectations derived from previous studies. Despite MNDWI significantly indicating reduced resilience in Qeshm Island (Kendall's tau of acf (1): 0.86 and SD: 0.90), it also signaled decreased resilience in Gabrik (Kendall's tau of acf (1): 0.79 and SD: 0.90). Moreover, MVWR failed to indicate signals of reduced resilience in both sites, specifically in Qeshm (Kendall's tau of acf (1): -0.10 and SD: -0.07) and in Gabrik (Kendall's tau of acf (1): -0.72 and SD: -0.12). These findings may be explained through quantitative analyses of land-use and land-cover change. While Qeshm Island and Gabrik share similarities in climate, geography, and annual rainfall, the analysis of land-use and land-cover change revealed significant differences between the two study areas. Qeshm Island underwent drastic increases in the built-up class by a 64.40% change between 1996 and 2014, whereas the built-up class expanded modestly by a 4.04% change in the Gabrik site.

In order to characterize and quantify the transformations in the north Ethiopian Highlands, a study was carried out over 8884 km(2) of the Tigray Highlands of northern Ethiopia. Using Landsat Multispectral Scanner and later Thematic Mapper imagery (1972, 1984/1986 and 2000), historical terrestrial photographs (1974-1975) and fieldwork (2008), we prepared land use and cover maps. For assessing the use of the historical terrestrial photographs, Landsat images from 1972 were classified using two different methods, namely conventional change detection (image differencing) and ground truthing (using the historical photographs of 1974-1975). Results show that the use of terrestrial photographs is promising, as the classification accuracy based on this method (Kappa coefficient 0.54) is better than the classification accuracy of the method based on image differencing (Kappa coefficient 0.46). Major land use and cover changes indicate the following: (1) a gradual but significant decline in bare ground (32 per cent in 1972 to 8 per cent in 2000); (2) a significant increase of bushland (25 to 43 per cent) and total forest area (including eucalypt plantations, 2.6 to 6.3 per cent); and (3) creation of numerous lakes and ponds. The dominant change trajectory (27 per cent of the study area) indicates a gradual or recent vegetation increase.

As a study area, a typical Less Favoured Area of Northern Greece was examined, where in the last years major changes have occurred that affected the ecological footprint. Tourist activity, population variation and land use/land cover changes are local factors that affect the ecological footprint of an area. An ecological footprint map was created with the use of Geographic Information Systems. Regarding land cover, forest areas have the biggest positive impact on the ecological footprint, followed by pastures. Structured environment has the most negative ecological impact, followed by agricultural areas. Agricultural areas have a particularly negative ecological impact in the study area, as the dominant cultivations (wheat and tobacco) are not as environmental friendly as tree crops cultivations. Overall, the ecological footprint affects the sustainability perspectives of an area, and certain actions can affect the final outcome for the sustainable development.

Understanding the causes and effects of internal migration is critical to the development and implementation of policies that promote land use planning and sustainable resource management. Using geospatial information technologies and social research methods, we investigated the causes and effects of internal migration on land use and land cover patterns in a western mountain district of Nepal between 1998 and 2013. The results show a decreasing number of households at high elevations (above 1400 m), where an increase in forest cover has been observed with a consequent decrease in agricultural land and shrub- or grassland. At lower elevations (below 1400 m), forest cover has remained constant over the last 25 years, and the agricultural land area has increased but has become geometrically complex to meet the diverse needs and living requirements of the growing population. Our findings indicate that internal migration plays an important role in shaping land use and land cover change in the middle mountains of Nepal and largely determines the resource management, utilization, and distribution patterns within a small geographic unit.

Isotopic methods were used to identify nitrate sources, and the Bayesian stable isotope mixing model (MixSIAR) was used to determine the proportional contributions of potential sources under different land types. The results indicate that from 2015 to 2021, the distribution of high nitrate groundwater had been extended from the western region to the whole region. Groundwater nitrate levels are higher in farmland and rural land, contrasting with relatively lower concentrations in the forest/grassland types near the northern Qinling Mountains. Forest/grassland was negatively correlated with NO3-, indicating that plant roots may enhance nitrogen uptake. Soil nitrogen, manure/sewage, and chemical fertilizers were primary nitrogen sources. In addition, the average contribution of soil nitrogen in farmland, rural land, and forest/grassland to groundwater NO3- were 48.1, 50.2, and 44.8%, respectively. The mean proportional contribution of chemical fertilizers in farmland is 32.4%. Manure/sewage has the highest proportional contribution in forest/grassland, at 30%.

In April 2018, remote sensing was used to quantify land use and land cover changes between 1990 and 2015 based on satellite images acquired from North Atlantic Space Agency (LANDSAT TM, path 170 raw 73). Household surveys were administered using a structured questionnaire to 100 communal settlers to collect biophysical/socioecological data on explanatory variables which included; density of human and livestock, fuelwood consumption and area under cultivation. The study used multicriteria evaluation procedure based on dynamic adjustments of socio-ecological data to generate transitional probability maps of SVC. Thresholds of socio-ecological data were then computed in the Markov-cellular automata model through a multi-objective land allocation procedure and a cellular automata spatial filter in order to simulate future land use and land cover maps of 2020, 2030 and 2040 for SVC. If the Zimbabwe land reform and its agricultural resettlement program is not properly coordinated and planned in the study area, the study predicted a continuing downward trend in woodland cover category and a significant upward trend of land under agriculture. For the period 1990 to the 2040s, the woodland cover is likely to decrease by 46.7% changing into agricultural land use and/or bare land in SVC. Future land use and land cover simulations indicated that if the current land use and land cover trends continue unabated across the study area without a holistic sustainable agricultural land-wildlife management plan and community development measures, severe woodland degradation will occur. The study recommends ecological restoration and/or re-planning on agriculture-wildlife land use and zonation, delineating agriculture and human settlement in the southern part of the conservancy while the northern part of SVC is exclusively reserved and protected for wildlife management.",Land use,land cover,human encroachment,protected area,savanna,,,"Mhuriro-Mashapa, P.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, LULC patterns and their underlying change mechanisms under future climate conditions are not well known. Therefore, it is particularly important to explore the direction of LULC transfer in the study area, identify the factors driving the transfer of different types of LULC and their changes, and simulate future LULC patterns under future climate conditions. Based on LULC analyses of Rwanda in 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2015, the LULC pattern of Rwanda in the next 30 years was simulated using an LULC transition matrix, random forest sampling, the Markov chain model, and the PLUS model. The results showed that LULC change in the study area primarily comprised a decrease in forest area and expansion of cropland area, accompanied by a small increase in grassland area and an annual increase in urban land area. Prior to 2000, the LULC in Rwanda was mainly converted from forest and grassland to cropland, with the ratio being 0.72:0.28. After 2010, the LULC was mainly converted from forest to grassland and cropland, with the ratio being 0.83:0.17. Changes in forests, grasslands, and cropland are driven by multiple factors, whereas changes in wetlands, water, urban land, and unused land are more likely to be driven by a single factor.

Global coffee market fluctuations were found to be the major cause of landscape change in the Study region. When the global coffee prices increased, more forested areas were cleared for coffee cultivation. Failure of global coffee market forced farmers to convert land from subsistence farming (rice) to short-period commercial crops like ginger. This also resulted in land degradation in rice paddies.

Residential development is expected to continue mostly in the central part of the watershed in the near future. Historic, current and future LULC maps were developed by processing aerial imagery, which were used in the HEC-HMS hydrologic model to study flood risk. An index method was applied to estimate the contribution of different parts of the watershed to downstream peak flows.

In this study, we incorporate land cover data from MODIS in 2019 into the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to simulate the impacts of LULC on meteorological parameters over the Sichuan Basin (SCB). Further, we conduct Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) simulations with WRF default LULC and MODIS 2019 to probe the effects on regional air quality. Despite consistency found between meteorological observations and WRF-CMAQ simulations, the default WRF land cover data does not accurately capture rapid urbanization over time compared with MODIS. Modeling results indicate that magnitude changes trigged by LULCC are highly varied across SCB and the impacts of LULCC are more pronounced over extended metropolitan areas due to alteration by urbanization, featured by elevating 2-m temperature up to 2 degrees C and increased planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) up to 400 m. For air quality implications, it is found that LULCC leads to basin-wide O-3 enhancements with maximum reaching 21.6 mu g/m(3) and 57.2 mu g/m(3) in the daytime and nighttime, respectively, which is mainly attributed to weakening NOx titration effects at night.

The fact that humans have adapted to almost all of Earth's environments, yet remain strongly clustered within each of these environments influences both the nature of anthropogenic impact on Earth's landscapes and the challenges of mapping it. Remote sensing provides a consistent synoptic view of these environments by mapping the land cover associated with the anthropogenic land uses of settlement and food production, as well as their complement in forest cover. We give brief descriptions and illustrative comparisons of several current land cover products representing the global extents of settlements, agriculture and forests derived from remote sensing. To accommodate the challenges inherent to mapping any land cover at widely varying scales, we compare size distributions of spatially contiguous land cover (rather than total area) for several global land cover products. Despite the use of different sensors and different mapping criteria, there is remarkable consistency in the size distributions of these products -both within and across land cover class. Rank-size distributions of settlements, agricultural areas and forests are all well-described by power laws spanning more than four orders of magnitude in both area and number. This consistency in the form of the distributions suggests fundamental similarities among different types of land cover. The observed similarities can be explained by depicting land cover mosaics as co-evolving spatial networks sharing common processes of nucleation, growth and connection.

The results in terms of land-use/land-cover classes during the study period (2011-2016) indicate that cultivated land showed maximum positive changes in both sub-catchments, while bushland and woodland showed maximum negative changes upstream and downstream. The results showed that bushland, woodland, cultivated land, and grassland were significantly correlated with water point characteristics in both sub-catchments. For functionality characteristics, a significant effect was observed in bushland and grassland upstream and downstream, respectively, while sufficient water was found in woodland upstream and grassland downstream. Moreover, bushland was observed to have a significant number of water points with poor quality of water upstream, and a substantial number of water points with good quality of water were found in grassland downstream. We found that all measured land-use/land-cover changes and water point characteristic correlations were statistically significant; therefore, we concluded that land-use/land-cover change affects the water ecosystem in the basin.

To this end, this study assessed the trends of LU/LCC and its drivers in Western Ethiopia. Landsat images of MSS (1978), TM (1986, 1991 and 2010), ETM + (1999) and OLI (2013 and 2016) were used to study the dynamics of LU/LCC. The land use/land cover (LU/LC) maps for each period were classified using a hybrid method by merging the outputs of supervised classification and intensive on-screen-digitizing techniques. The drivers of LU/LCC were studied using key informant interviews (KII) and focus group discussions (FGD). Four major LU/LC types namely forest, agriculture, shrub/grass, and settlement were identified with overall accuracies ranging from 91% to 94%. The result shows that forest was the dominant LU/LC type accounting for 69% in 1978 which later reduced to 13, 8.5 and 6.5 percent point (pp) in 1991, 2010, and 2016, respectively. Shrub/grasslands were also reduced by 11 pp from 2010 to 2016. Expansion of agricultural land was the major driver showing a radical increase by 13 pp between 2013 and 2016. Forest cover showed a reduction of 28 pp over the 38 years of the study period. In particular, 21.3%, 26%, and 16.6% of the forest was converted to shrub/grassland from 1986 to 1991, 1991 to 2010 and 2010 to 2016, respectively. But from 2010 to 2016, 19.13% of forest was converted to agriculture. The study showed that forest was first changed to shrub/grasslands and finally end up in agriculture showing that degradation is leading to deforestation. The result of FGDs and KIIs also showed that both small-scale subsistence agriculture and largescale commercial agriculture are the major proximate drivers of deforestation in the study area. Population pressure from a multi-sourced and continued inflow of immigrants, lack of integrated institutional frameworks and unsustainable exploitations of forest products are the major underlying causes of the observed changes.

Yet, classification algorithms remain dependent on samples collected on the field and field campaigns are limited by financial, infrastructural and political boundaries. Here, animal tracking data could be an asset. Looking at the land cover dependencies of animal behaviour, we can obtain land cover samples over places that are difficult to access. Following this premise, we evaluated the potential of animal movement data to map land cover. Specifically, we used 13 White Storks (Cicona cicona) individuals of the same population to map agriculture within three test regions distributed along their migratory track. The White Stork has adapted to foraging over agricultural lands, making it an ideal source of samples to map this land use. We applied a presence-absence modelling approach over a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series and validated our classifications, with high-resolution land cover information. Our results suggest White Stork movement is useful to map agriculture, however, we identified some limitations. We achieved high accuracies (F1-scores > 0.8) for two test regions, but observed poor results over one region. This can be explained by differences in land management practices. The animals preferred agriculture in every test region, but our data showed a biased distribution of training samples between irrigated and non-irrigated land. When both options occurred, the animals disregarded non-irrigated land leading to its misclassification as non-agriculture. Additionally, we found difference between the GPS observation dates and the harvest times for non-irrigated crops. Given the White Stork takes advantage of managed land to search for prey, the inactivity of these fields was the likely culprit of their underrepresentation. Including more species attracted to agriculture - with other land-use dependencies and observation times - can contribute to better results in similar applications.",Animal Tracking,land cover,land use,movement ecology,R,remote sensing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present work, the land change model for Greece, a typical Mediterranean country, has been developed, based on historical information from remotely sensed land cover data. Land cover types based on the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP) classification were obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover product, i.e. MCD12Q1, provided annually from 2001 to 2018 at a spatial resolution of 500 m. Initially, the dominant land cover changes and their driving variables for the decade of 2001 to 2011 were determined and the transition potential of land was mapped using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network. Four dominant land-cover transformations were found in Greece from 2001 to 2011, i.e. land transformation from Savannas to Woody Savannas, from Savannas to Grasslands, from Grasslands to Savannas, and from Croplands to Grasslands. Driving variables were found to be the Evidence Likelihood of Land Cover, i.e. the relative frequency with which different land cover categories occurred within the areas that transitioned, the Altitude as realized in the Digital Elevation Model of Greece from ASTER GDEM, the Distance from previously changed land and two climate variables i.e. Mean Annual Precipitation and Mean Annual Minimum Temperature. After the model was calibrated, its predictive ability was tested for land cover prediction for 2018 and was found to be 96.7%. Future land cover projections up to 2030 were developed incorporating CMIP6 climate data under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), i.e SSP126 corresponding to a sustainable future and SSP585, which describes the future world based on fossil-fueled development. The results indicate that major historical land transformations in Greece, do not correspond to land degradation or desertification, as it has been reported in previous works. On the contrary, the land cover transitions indicate that the Woody Savannas gain areas constantly, whereas Grasslands and Croplands lose areas, and forested areas of all types demonstrate moderate gains. Concerning future land cover, the present work indicates that the direction of historical changes will also prevail in the next decade, with the most severe scenario, i.e. SSP585 slowing down the rate of changes and the most sustainable one, i.e. SSP126, accelerating the rate of expansion of woody vegetation land cover type.",Land change model,remote sensing,land cover,land use,land cover change,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study interprets land use and land cover status and the changes within the Koshi River Basin (KRB) using Landsat remote sensing (RS) image data, and employs logistic regression model to analyze the influence of natural and socioeconomic driving forces on major land cover changes. The results showed that the areas of built-up land, bare land and forest in KRB increased from 1990 to 2015, including the largest increases in forest and the highest growth rate in construction land. Areas of glacier, grassland, sparse vegetation, shrub land, cropland, and wetland all decreased over the study period. From the perspective of driving analysis, the role of human activities in land use and land cover change is significant than climate factors. Cropland expansion is the reclamation of cropland by farmers, mainly from early deforestation. However, labor force separation, geological disasters and drought are the main factors of cropland shrinkage. The increase of forest area in India and Nepal was attributed to the government's forest protection policies, such as Nepal's community forestry has achieved remarkable results.

However, the uncertainties of land use and land cover (LULC) and vegetation schemes on non-radiative effects, and the roles of non-radiative effects on T-s, remain uncertain. In this study, we investigate the local impact of LULC differences by comparing Noah with multiparameterization (Noah-MP) land model simulations with different LULC data sets and those with vegetation schemes whether they include interactive canopies. We attribute T-s changes induced by LULC differences obtained from Noah-MP simulations to radiative and non-radiative effects over East Asia based on the decomposed temperature metric theory. The results indicate that vegetation cools T-s over urban regions by 4.0-6.0?. Grassland and cropland decrease the T-s over barren regions. Forests are warmer (cooler) than grassland and cropland in high latitudes (in mid and low latitudes). Grassland is cooler than cropland. However, the magnitude of T-s changes induced by these differences is lower than that induced by differences between vegetation and urban. The non-radiative effect generally explains more than 50% of the local changes in T-s. The interactive canopies enlarge T-s changes for afforestation or replacements of urban region by vegetation. The effect of uncertainties in LULC data sets is negligible.

However, the explorer on the physical mechanism using the Weather Research and Forecasting model with subgrid scale process precisely described here revealed that the LUCC impacts could not be directly interpreted by surface albedo changes only. The land use-cloud-radiation feedback, within which cloud amount and cloud ceiling, large-scale circulation related moisture flux and local evaporation were altered, played an essential role in affecting surface energy and water budgets between land surface and the atmosphere, especially for the impacted downward shortwave radiation flux. With subgrid scale process considered in describing LUCC and the land use-cloud-radiation feedback emphasized, LUCC impacts on surface air temperature (SAT), precipitation and near-surface wind speed (NSWS) were explored, which displayed marked temporal and spatial characteristics. The LUCC climate effects for both the influenced terrestrial subregions and the intensity were larger over summertime, expressing marked affection on the East Asian Summer Monsoon system. The LUCC impacts on SAT and NSWS mainly presented as changes in mean state, whereas the influences on the precipitation principally displayed as changes in the variability. LUCC induced changes in the averaged SAT, precipitation and NSWS were small, whereas the nearly symmetric distributions between positive and negative changes, which contributed to total changes, were much larger and might have a considerable impact on local and regional climate, especially on extreme climate events.",Land use and land cover changes,The land use-cloud-radiation feedback,Subgrid scale process,Mean climate state,The variability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous studies indicate a relation between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land use, and land cover with plant diversity. However, the association between terrestrial plant diversity and NDVI in the Ghodaghodi Lake Complex is unknown but has important implications due to potential land use changes. We aimed to understand the relationship between plant diversity and NDVI in the Ghodaghodi Lake Complex. We performed a vegetation survey using a simple random sampling methodology. Shannon-Wiener's diversity index (H') was calculated from the field data, and Landsat images were used to compare land use and land cover changes and calculate NDVI values for 2000 and 2022. The image classification shows that forest cover in April and December 2000 was 71.1% and 58.5%, respectively, and was the dominant land cover in the study area. In contrast, agriculture occupied 18.8% and 27.3% in April and December 2000, respectively, and was the primary land use. Forests covered the most land in April (64.8%) and December (65.3%) of 2022. Likewise, agriculture was a widespread land use. We found a significant correlation (r = 0.80, p < 0.05) between the NDVI and plant species diversity, as the NDVI explained 65% of plant species diversity. There was a decrease in forest cover from 2000 to 2022. The strong correlation between the NDVI and vegetation species diversity shows that the NDVI can be a substitute for plant diversity.

Turkey is one of the countries experiencing a rapid urbanization which has resulted in significant UHI impacts on the regional climate and environment. This study was conducted in Osmaniye city, Turkey, where there is a need to determine the effects of land-use/land-cover changes (LUCC) on the UHI using Landsat images. The geospatial analyses were undertaken using USGS/NASA Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus geospatial data from 2000 to 2018. The results showed that percent cover of urban areas significantly increased from 6.13 to 17.76%, broad-leaved forest cover decreased from 14.2 to 11.6%, road and rail network cover increased from 5.23 to 10.85%, and coniferous forest cover decreased from 15.85 to 9.02% between 2000 and 2018. During the process of urbanization from 2000 to 2018, most of the bare land cover was converted to agricultural lands and urbanized areas due to vegetative degradation, and industrial units cover increased from 7.76 to 9.53%. The land surface temperature was 35.57 degrees C for approximately 25% of the study area in 2000, while the same temperature was calculated for 76% of the study area in 2018. The results suggest that LUCC from vegetation to urbanized areas has significantly increased the land surface temperature.

This study examines the land-atmosphere coupling strength and the relationship between surface fluxes and clouds and precipitation for three land cover scenarios in the European summer. The WRF model was used to simulate one scenario with extreme afforestation, one with extreme deforestation, and one with realistic land cover for the time period between 1986 and 2015. The simulations were forced with ERA-Interim reanalysis data. The analysis followed a two-step approach. First, the convective triggering potential-low-level humidity index framework was applied to locate potential coupling hot spots, which were then analyzed with regard to their sensitivity toward land use and land cover changes. Second, actual feedbacks between evaporative fraction, cloud cover, and precipitation were analyzed statistically with focus on sign and location of the feedbacks. The results demonstrate that coupling hot spots, exhibiting predominantly positive feedbacks, were identified over parts of Eastern Europe and Scandinavia. In this strongly coupled region, afforestation and deforestation modified the atmospheric humidity and stability by changing the surface flux partitioning. Afforestation is associated with a net drying of the atmosphere due to a disproportionately strong increase in the sensible heat flux. In contrast, deforestation initiated a moistening of the atmosphere. The total precipitation changed only in limited areas significantly, which are mostly located in mountainous regions and the northeast of the domain. In summary, the results indicate a land surface influence on the atmospheric background conditions, and an impact on the potential strength of land surface-precipitation feedbacks.",land use and land cover change,land-atmosphere coupling strength,land-atmosphere feedbacks,,,,,"Kaas, Eigil","Wulfmeyer, Volker",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although there is an ongoing movement towards the development of higher resolution global land cover maps, medium resolution land cover products (e.g. GLC2000 and MODIS) are still very useful for modelling and assessment purposes. However, the current land cover products are not accurate enough for many applications so we need to develop approaches that can take existing land covers maps and produce a better overall product in a hybrid approach. This paper uses geographically weighted regression (GWR) and crowdsourced validation data from Geo-Wiki to create two hybrid global land cover maps that use medium resolution land cover products as an input. Two different methods were used: (a) the GWR was used to determine the best land cover product at each location; (b) the GWR was only used to determine the best land cover at those locations where all three land cover maps disagree, using the agreement of the land cover maps to determine land cover at the other cells. The results show that the hybrid land cover map developed using the first method resulted in a lower overall disagreement than the individual global land cover maps. The hybrid map produced by the second method was also better when compared to the GLC2000 and GlobCover but worse or similar in performance to the MODIS land cover product depending upon the metrics considered. The reason for this may be due to the use of the GLC2000 in the development of GlobCover, which may have resulted in areas where both maps agree with one another but not with MODIS, and where MODIS may in fact better represent land cover in those situations. These results serve to demonstrate that spatial analysis methods can be used to improve medium resolution global land cover information with existing products.

The CLUMondo model provides an innovative approach for global land-use change modeling to support integrated assessments. Demands for goods and services are, in the model, supplied by a variety of land systems that are characterized by their land cover mosaic, the agricultural management intensity, and livestock. Land system changes are simulated by the model, driven by regional demand for goods and influenced by local factors that either constrain or promote land system conversion. A characteristic of the new model is the endogenous simulation of intensification of agricultural management versus expansion of arable land, and urban versus rural settlements expansion based on land availability in the neighborhood of the location. Model results for the OECD Environmental Outlook scenario show that allocation of increased agricultural production by either management intensification or area expansion varies both among and within world regions, providing useful insight into the land sparing versus land sharing debate. The land system approach allows the inclusion of different types of demand for goods and services from the land system as a driving factor of land system change.

Interaction effects revealed: both the positive effects of native plant canopy cover on ant species richness and abundance, and the negative effects of exotic plant groundcover on species richness were greatest at sites with warmer and drier climates.Impacts of climate change on insect biodiversity may be mitigated to some degree through landscape adaptation by increasing woody native vegetation cover and by reducing land use intensity, the cover of exotic vegetation and of bare ground.

Visual interpretation of false-color composites and hybrid supervised classification method integrated with GIS analyses were used to generate land-use/cover maps. The results showed that vegetation and salty land decreased, while bare land and shallow-water areas increased. Changed areas accounted for 46.5$ of the total area. Conversions from and to salty lands, shallow water level and bare lands were by far the most extensive changes. Shallow water level and bare land increased, while salty land and vegetation land areas decreased in the 10-year period between 2000 and 2010. Four classes of qualitative changes were recognized based on land-use detection; The Type I change indicated changes in water level from deep water to moderate and shallow levels due to reduced water output from Hirmand, and a lower water depth in the ChahNimeh reservoirs. Vegetation cover was decreased. The Type II changes mainly transpired within vegetation lands. The Type DI changes included changes from vegetation to salty lands. Transformations between salty lands to bare land were typical of Type IV changes. Detecting and monitoring of these changes are discussed in relation to the management of this important shelter for wintering migratory birds.",GIS,Land-use/cover change,Changedetection,Image rationing,Post-classification comparison,land-use planning,,"Shariff, Abdul Rashid B.

In this paper, an attempt has been made to analyse and monitor the LULC changes using multi-temporal Landsat data for the years 1979, 1989 and 1999 and ASTER data for the year 2009. In addition, efforts were made to discuss the impact of LULC changes on the selected soil properties. For this, a post-classification comparison technique was used to detect LULC changes from satellite images. Primarily, three main LULC types were selected to investigate the properties of soil, namely, cultivated land, fallow land and woodland. Moreover, soil samples were also collected at two depths of surface soil from ten sample plots for each of the LULC type. For these soil samples, various soil properties such as texture, bulk density, organic matter, soil pH, electrical conductivity, sodium adsorption ratio, phosphorous and potassium were analysed. The results showed that a significant and extensive change of LULC patterns has occurred in the last three decades in the study area. Further, laboratory tests revealed that soil properties were significantly affected by these LULC changes. The change of the physical and chemical properties of the soil may have attributed to the changes in the LULC resulting in land degradation, which in turn has led to a decline in soil productivity.

Here, we explored how protected areas affected land cover volatility in China from 2011 to 2020 with LandTrendr using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform by comparing the difference in volatility of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in protected and unprotected areas. The results show that the regions with frequent land cover volatility are mainly located in eastern, central, and southwestern China, indicating that land cover volatility with high NDVI loss values is spatially aggregated in most cases. Considering the impact of protected areas, land cover volatility is relatively consistent inside and outside the protected area throughout the study period, showing a trend of first fluctuating and then rising. Approximately 22% of detected land cover volatility occurred in protected areas, though the average NDVI loss value (0.56) for protected areas was greater than unprotected areas (0.51). Combined with the outliers, land cover volatility accompanied by larger NDVI loss values is still primarily distributed in unprotected areas in most years. The detection of NDVI gain values in protected areas shows that protected areas (average value is 0.48) are larger than unprotected areas (average value is 0.47) almost every year, even combined with the outliers, and land cover volatility accompanied by larger NDVI gain values is also primarily distributed in protected areas in most years.

If epilithic organisms grow using organic matter and nutrients ultimately discharge into rivers, it is likely that the taxonomic composition of epilithic fungal communities will change spatially depending on the land use and land cover (LULC) in the drainage area. To test this hypothesis, we examined the relationship between the taxonomic composition of fungi on cobbles and the LULC in the fall and in spring. The taxonomic composition of the epilithic fungi was significantly related to ambient water temperatures and concentrations of nutrients and dissolved organic carbon. Supporting our hypothesis, the taxonomic composition of the epilithic fungi differed largely among the reaches covered mainly by different forest types and land uses in both the fall and in spring. The results suggest that the quality of the dissolved organic matter differed among the catchment areas depending on the LULC. Further analyses indicated that the sum of the LULC and within-river variables could explain 36.4 and 41.2 % of the spatial variation in the fungal taxonomic compositions in the fall and in spring, respectively. The LULC variables alone explained 16.1-18.7 % of the variations, and a similar percentage was found for within-river variables. These results suggest that the organic matter from LULC was equally as important as physical and nutrient conditions in the ambient water for determining the community structure of epilithic fungi in rivers.",Aquatic fungal community,Organic matter,Nutrient,Drainage basin,Land use and land cover,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This innovative system, referred to as ""falaj"" in the singular form, is composed of a sophisticated network of underground tunnels and open-air channels designed to access shallow subterranean water tables, thereby providing water for residential and agricultural use. The aflaj systems have played a significant role in supporting sustainable water resource management in arid and semiarid regions, making a notable contribution to the socioeconomic development of the country. The alteration of land use and land cover (LULC) in arid and semiarid regions can have significant consequences for hydrological systems, affecting the ability of local ecosystems to manage fresh surface and groundwater resources. These changes are often caused by both natural and anthropogenic factors. To investigate the impact of LULC changes on aflaj systems in the northern part of Oman, we utilized satellite imagery, aflaj data, and spatial analytical and image processing techniques within the framework of geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing. In the first part of the study, we quantified the changes in LULC and their impact on aflaj systems in seven cities in Oman due to urban expansion. In the second part, we evaluated the effect of LULC on groundwater for four major aflaj between 1985 and 2021. The study area was divided into four primary LULC classifications: vegetation, bodies of water, metropolitan areas, and bare soil. The classification maps demonstrated a high overall accuracy of 90% to 95%, indicating satisfactory performance. Our results revealed a significant reduction in vegetation areas between 1985 and 2021, primarily shifting from bare soil (BS) to urban areas (UAs) and from vegetation cover (VC) to BS, due to the reduction of groundwater resources. Over the four study periods (1985-1990, 1990-2000, 2000-2013, and 2013-2021), the percentages of the total area of Falaj Al-Muyasser, Falaj Daris, Falaj Al-Maliki, and Falaj Al-Khatmeen that transformed from agricultural lands to UAs were 40%, 39%, 32%, and 8%, respectively.

To assess land use land cover changes between 1985 and 2014, and subsequently determine the trends and drivers of these changes, we used a series of Landsat images and field data obtained from the LVB. Landsat image pre-processing and band combinations were done in ENVI 5.1. A supervised classification was applied on 118 Landsat scenes using the maximum likelihood classifier in ENVI 5.1. The overall accuracy of classified images was computed for the 2014 images using 124 reference data points collected through stratified random sampling. Computations of area under various land cover classes were calculated between the 1985 and 2014 images. We also correlated the area from natural vegetation classes to farmlands and settlements (urban areas) to explore relationships between land use land cover conversions among these classes. Based on our land cover classifications, we obtained overall accuracy of 71% and a moderate Kappa statistic of 0.56. Our results indicate that the LVB has undergone drastic changes in land use land cover, mainly driven by human activities that led to the conversion of forests, woodlands, grasslands, and wetlands to either farmlands or settlements. We conclude that information from this work is useful not only for basin-scale assessments and monitoring of land cover changes but also for targeting, prioritizing, and monitoring of small scale, community led efforts to restore degraded and fragmented areas in the basin. Such efforts could mitigate the loss of ecosystem services previously derived from large contiguous land covers which are no longer tenable to restore. We recommend adoption of a basin scale, operational, Earth observation-based, land use change monitoring framework. Such a framework can facilitate rapid and frequent assessments of gains and losses in specific land cover classes and thus focus strategic interventions in areas experiencing major losses, through mitigation and compensatory approaches.",remote sensing,Landsat,Lake Victoria Basin,land use land cover,,,,"Ndubi, Antony","Adams, Emily C.","Flores-Anderson, Africa, I",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This assessment also provides data-driven insights into the complex interactions between humans, climate, and the environment. This study aims to examine the dynamic changes in land cover in Myanmar over a thirty-year period from a comprehensive perspective. This paper, based on the MLC30 land cover dataset for Myanmar from 1990 to 2020, employs land use dynamic degree and land use transition matrix to analyze the extent and process of land cover changes in Myanmar. Furthermore, using landscape pattern indicators, the paper explores the changes in the spatial structural characteristics of land cover in Myanmar at both the patch scale and the landscape scale. The results indicate the following: (a) Areas with significant land cover changes are primarily located in the eastern, southeastern, and southwestern regions bordering China, Laos, and Thailand, as well as the coastal areas, with the change intensity from 2000 to 2020 being notably higher than before 2000. (b) Myanmar's cultivated land, artificial surfaces, and water bodies show an expanding trend, with cultivated land expansion mainly at the expense of forests, while the increase in artificial surfaces and water bodies is through the conversion of the existing cultivated land. (c) Myanmar's landscape patterns remained stable from 1990 to 2000. However, after 2000, the land cover has shown a clear trend towards fragmentation and spatial distribution dispersion, especially for the dominant forest and cultivated land types. Despite Myanmar's rapid economic development, the trend toward the fragmentation and irregularization of cultivated land patches indicates a lack of attention to cultivated land use and planning. The reduction and fragmentation of forest areas have led to a decline in ecological connectivity, posing risks of ecological environment deterioration.

Here, we employed the state-of-the-art CMIP6-LUMIP future projections to analyze the responses of future temperature and precipitation extremes induced by deforestation. This study used more realistic forest change projections to better characterize real-world climate responses and used a multi-model ensemble to reduce model uncertainties. Results indicate that the deforestation regions are projected to induce a remarkably hotter and drier future at the end of the twenty-first century. However, the climate responses averaged globally to deforestation have no obvious changes due to the colder and wetter compensation responses in other regions. The maximum temperature increase in deforestation regions is prominent in intensity, frequency, and duration aspects, while the drought is mainly manifested by frequency and duration reduction of precipitation. Seasonal cycle of changes in temperature indices can be discovered in the mid-latitude deforestation region, tropical region shows year-round consistency by comparison. Moreover, thanks to the rich and reasonable experimental designs of CMIP6-LUMIP, we can compare the deforestation impacts under different climate backgrounds and find changes in climate extremes are more obvious under the low-emission scenario in general.

Will temperature and precipitation increase significantly during global warming resulting in more pronounced LUCC climatic effects? Considering the interannual forcing of these two factors, the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model (CAM4.0) was used in this study to investigate the importance of climatological background to LUCC impacts. Experiments based on the difference in the background climate, the greenhouse gas concentrations in 1850 and in the present age indicate contrary changes in climate sensitivity through estimations of the radiative forcing associated with LUCC, which are 0.54A degrees C/(W/m(2)) and -0.26A degrees C/(W/m(2)), respectively. Therefore, the background climate appears to play an important role in the regional impact of LUCC, especially at higher latitudes. In addition, global warming predominantly influences snow-albedo feedback in the mid-latitudes, thus determining the impact of LUCC, whereas the regional difference in precipitation caused by global warming is responsible for the differing climate response to LUCC in the tropics and subtropics.",land use/land cover change (LUCC),global warming,climatic effects,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results achieved are compared using the standard ARW Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (ARW-MODIS) global land cover data and a regional land cover map produced at the Centre for Remote Imaging, Sensing and Processing (ARW-CRISP), Singapore. The high-resolution simulations are conducted with triple-nested domains (horizontal grid spacing 27, 9 and 3 km) and 51 unequally spaced vertical sigma levels. The evolution of PBL variables and rainfall are modelled for four seasons (northeast monsoon season, first inter-monsoon period, southwest monsoon season and second inter-monsoon period). For the purpose of numerical simulations, 30days in each season were considered and the model-simulated variables were validated with in situ available meteorological observations and rainfall at four stations over Singapore. The simulation results highlight the broad variation of the low-level flow-field in different seasons. The ARW mesoscale model simulated diurnal trends in surface meteorological variables and rainfall are in better agreement with observations by using the ARW-CRISP regional land cover map compared to ARW-MODIS global land cover data.

Integration methods using both the GLC maps and reference data at their locations resulted in 4.5%-13% higher correspondence with the reference LC than any of the input GLC maps. An integrated LC map and LC class probability maps were computed using regression kriging, which produced the highest correspondence (76%).

However, it is uncertain to what extent livestock, particularly monogastric livestock, determines land systems. We included monogastrics in a land system classification, and statistically analyzed the land cover composition and agricultural production of otherwise similar land systems with and without monogastric livestock. The results indicate that land systems with monogastrics are statistically different from their counterparts in the classification without monogastrics in terms of grassland area and crop yields, but are less different in terms of tree area, crop area, and ruminant livestock production. We then used a land systems map that includes monogastrics in the classification and a similar map that does not include monogastrics to project future changes in a novel manner that integrates livestock as a determinant of land systems. The results show that including monogastrics in otherwise similar projections yields less cropland intensification and more cropland expansion in several world regions, including Northern Africa and the Middle East. Other regions, such as Europe and Australia, were characterized by less decrease or more increase in tree area in the application with monogastrics, mainly due to the occurrence of open forests with monogastrics.

The moderate to strong cold stress in the annual and winter climatology in the midlatitudes was replaced by no thermal stress in the summer, while the summertime ranged from moderate to strong heat stress. A negative correlation was observed between thermal stress and southern hemispheric primary forests. Perennial croplands had the most dynamic changes in intensity during the historical period. Primary and secondary forests had an active influence on global thermal stress. Areas in the tropics recording moderate heat stress coincided with secondary nonforest, pastureland, and annual cropland expansions. The conversion of forest to range land and croplands and the subsequent negative forest trends increased the severity of thermal stress. The future projection showed intense thermal stress; however, the SSP-585 signals were more potent.

Until now, however, few efforts have been made to document the impact of land use and land cover changes on the climate, environment, and ecosystem of the country because of a lack of geospatial data and time-series information. By using open source Landsat data integrated with GIS technologies and other ancillary data, this study attempts to classify land use and create land cover maps, enabling post-classification change detection analysis. By this method, we document the spatial and temporal trajectory of urban expansion in Chittagong, the second largest city in Bangladesh, over a 36-year period. The findings suggest that, over the study period, 56 % of the land cover has undergone change, mainly because of the expansion of built-up areas and other human activities. During the 36-year period, the built-up area around Chittagong city has expanded by 618 %, with an average annual rate of increase of 17.5 %. As a result of rapid urbanization, the vegetated hills near urban development areas face serious threats of further encroachment and degradation, given that 2178 ha of hills have already been intruded over the study period. Because urbanization processes in Bangladesh have traditionally been viewed as the result of population growth and economic development, very little work has been done to track the potential growth trajectory in a physical or spatial context. This study, therefore, will contribute to the current understanding of urban development in Bangladesh from a temporal and spatial point of view.

This study aims to determine the implication of LULC dynamics on land cover degradation in Eastern DR Congo. This region has been subjected to uncontrolled LULC changes over the last three decades but the impact of these changes on land degradation has not been assessed yet at the territorial level. To fill this gap, the territory of Kalehe has been used as a case study to monitor the LULC changes during the 1987-2020 period based on the classification of Landsat images, to forecast the future LULC for the 2030-2070 period through the hybrid Markov-Support Vector Machine modeling, to determine the extent of land cover degradation associated with these changes and to assess the impact of biophysical and socio-economic factors on the occurrence of land cover degradation using the binary logistic regression model. The results reveal that the overall trends of LULC changes during the 1987-2020 period are the increasing of built-up area, shrubland, and cropland at the expense of forestland, wetland, and grassland. This situation is expected to continue in the future and contribute to the degradation of land cover within the study area.

Estuarine vegetated wetlands can adapt to sea-level rise through both vertical development (i.e., biophysical feedbacks and sedimentation) and upslope/horizontal migration. Quantifying changes to estuarine vegetated wetlands over time can help to inform current and future decisions regarding land management and resource stewardship. In this study, we show how coastal land cover maps readily available in the US can be used to assess and understand estuarine vegetated wetland changes. This assessment involves two steps: (1) identifying the net gain/loss of estuarine vegetated wetlands and (2) determining which land cover types contribute to the net gain/loss. From this information, we developed estuarine vegetated wetland change scenarios that evaluate whether estuarine vegetated wetland gain kept up with loss and whether the contribution was from: (1) estuarine vegetated wetland migration or tidal restoration; (2) land building (i.e., development); or (3) both. We assessed changes from 1996 to 2016 for: (1) the conterminous US; (2) each major US coastline; and (3) focal estuaries with the most change per coast. We found that the change scenario (1, 2, or 3) varied across coastlines.

Understanding the mechanisms behind wind erosion dynamics is crucial for mitigating its harmful effects. This study employs an integrated approach, combining the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology and local knowledge, to comprehensively assess wind erosion in the western region of Slovakia from 2001 to 2021. Using GIS-based AHP, the study assessed the spatial distribution of areas at high risk of wind erosion based on six parameters: wind speed, surface dryness, land use, land cover, soil texture, and field slope. A multicollinearity test was conducted to examine the collinearity of the chosen factors, and it was seen that none of the factors were compromised by multicollinearity. The results showed a significant increase in the risk of wind erosion in the study area over the past 20 years, with very high erosion risk in 2007, 2014, and 2021 increasing by 37 %, 86 %, and 128 %, respectively, compared to 2001. Statistical analyses confirm the significant impact of surface dryness, wind speed, land use, and land cover on wind erosion, emphasizing the need for targeted strategies to mitigate erosion risk. The regression analysis underscores the negative relationship between land use and wind erosion, emphasizing the pivotal role of land management in erosion prevention.

Among other things, images acquired by these sensors offer considerable potential for the derivation of information on urban land use. It has been suggested that this can be achieved via a two-stage process involving (i) a standard (per-pixel) multispectral classification algorithm to identify the principal land cover parcels present in the observed scene and (ii) the application of structural pattern-recognition techniques to infer land use from the morphological properties of these parcels and the spatial relations that exist between them. It is implicit in this approach that the initial classification is of sufficient accuracy to allow land use to be inferred from these structural properties and relations. This assumption is investigated using airborne multispectral image data with a nominal spatial resolution of 2 m. It is shown that these data allow many features of interest in urban areas to be identified and delineated, but that they contain a significant amount of unwanted spatial detail (or 'scene noise'). The latter results in structural 'clutter' in the initial land cover classification? which limits the potential to infer land use in the second stage of the data-processing chain. To address this issue, a simple, region-based, reflexive-mapping procedure is developed. This operates at the parcel (cf. pixel) level. The procedure is successful at removing much of the structural clutter, and performs well in comparison with traditional majority filtering; however, the inference of urban land use from the resulting data remains problematic.

A range of factors, such as the inclusion of an interactive ocean model component, representation of land management, transient LULCC, and accountability for atmospheric feedback, potentially shifts how models may detect the impacts of the land surface on the climate system. Previous studies on the biogeophysical effects of LULCC in South Asia have either neglected one of those factors or are single model results. Therefore, we analyzed the outputs from 11 models, participants of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project in its Sixth Phase (CMIP6), which derived from experiments with and without LULCC and compared the two simulations with respect to changes in near-surface temperature and total precipitation means. The CMIP6 simulations, to a certain extent, accounted for the elements previously overlooked. We examined the grid cells that robustly indicated a climatic impact from LULCC. Additionally, we investigated the atmospheric feedback and the dominant fluxes with their associated land surface variables involved in the changes in temperature and precipitation. Our results indicated that the biogeophysical effects from LULCC favored surface net cooling and surface net drying over the robust areas at all seasons. The surface net cooling was strongly influenced by the decrease in available energy and the increase in latent heat and total evapotranspiration. Surface net drying was highly promoted by local hydrological processes, especially in areas outside the monsoon core. The study also revealed that non-local sources might influence precipitation in some parts of South Asia, although this was inconclusive.

There are a lot of things that can be done to lessen the effect of urbanization to the surface temperature of the area like using green roofs or planting trees in the area. So land use really matters in both increasing and decreasing surface temperature. It is known that there is a relationship between land use land cover (LULC) and land surface temperature (LST).

Class-level spatial metrics were created in FRAGSTATS with the LULC and LST as inputs and these metrics were analysed using a statistical framework. Multi linear regression was done to create models that would predict LST for each class and it was found that the spatial metric ""Effective mesh size"" was a top predictor for LST in 6 out of 7 classes.

Expansion of forested area is clearly the main land cover change caused by the abandonment of traditional agricultural activities and by the use of other materials and energy sources instead of forest resources. As a result, about 64% of the area was covered by forest by 1996, whereas in 1957 forests accounted for only 40% of the land cover. Spontaneous afforestation of abandoned fields with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in terraced areas and areas of sparse scrub vegetation, coupled with an increase in the density of forest canopies, has been responsible for this expansion of woodland. The influence of physiographic factors in land cover change processes in the terraced areas of the catchment was also considered. The results demonstrate that within the terraced areas, north-facing and more elevated steeper slopes are more intensely afforested. However, an accurate analysis of the role played by these factors in land cover change cannot be carried out because the pattern of land abandonment is not independent of these physiographic characteristics.

However, they often have only a small number of high level land cover classes and they are static products, corresponding to a particular period of time, e.g., the GlobeLand30 (GL30) map for 2010. The OpenStreetMap (OSM), in contrast, consists of a very detailed, dynamically updated, spatial database of mapped features from around the world, but it suffers from incomplete coverage, and layers of overlapping features that are tagged in a variety of ways. However, it clearly has potential for land use and land cover (LULC) mapping. Thus the aim of this paper is to demonstrate how the OSM can be converted into a LULC map and how this OSM-derived LULC map can then be used to first update the GL30 with more recent information and secondly, enhance the information content of the classes. The technique is demonstrated on two study areas where there is availability of OSM data but in locations where authoritative data are lacking, i.e., Kathmandu, Nepal and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The GL30 and its updated and enhanced versions are independently validated using a stratified random sample so that the three maps can be compared. The results show that the updated version of GL30 improves in terms of overall accuracy since certain classes were not captured well in the original GL30 (e.g., water in Kathmandu and water/wetlands in Dar es Salaam). In contrast, the enhanced GL30, which contains more detailed urban classes, results in a drop in the overall accuracy, possibly due to the increased number of classes, but the advantages include the appearance of more detailed features, such as the road network, that becomes clearly visible.",land use/land cover mapping,OpenStreetMap,volunteered geographic information,Urban Atlas,GlobeLand30,,,"Antoniou, Vyron","See, Linda","Skopeliti, Andriani",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A novel classification method, integrating polarimetric target decomposition, object-oriented image analysis, and decision tree algorithms, is proposed for land use and land cover (LULC) classification using RADARSAT-2 polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data. The new method makes use of polarimetric information of PolSAR data, and takes advantage of object-oriented analysis and decision tree algorithms. The polarimetric target decomposition is aimed at extracting physical information from the observed scattering of microwaves by surface and volume for the classification of scattering data. The main purposes of the object-oriented image analysis are delineating objects and extracting various features, such as tone, shape, texture, area, and context. Decision tree algorithms provide an effective way to select features and create a decision tree for classification. The comparison between the proposed method and the Wishart supervised classification was made to test the performance of the proposed method. The overall accuracies of this proposed method and the Wishart supervised classification were 89.34% and 79.36%, respectively. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the Wishart supervised classification, and is an appropriate method for LULC classification of RADARSAT-2 PolSAR data.",Land cover,Land user,Polarization,RADARSAT,SAR,,,"Lin, Z.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"100 YEARS ISPRS ADVANCING REMOTE SENSING SCIENCE, PT 1",,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, a supervised classification was applied to four Landsat images collected over time (1984, 1999, 2005, and 2009) that provided recent and historical LULC conditions for the western Nile delta. The supervised classification results were further improved by employing image. enhancement and visual interpretation. Visual interpretation was not only useful in increasing the classification accuracy of the Landsat images, but it was also helpful in identifying areas with the effective use of water for irrigation and areas of private land reclamation. Five LULC categories were identified and mapped. Post-classification comparisons of the classified images indicated that the major change consisted of barren land changing into agricultural land. Approximately 28%, 14%, and 9% of barren land was changed to agricultural land in the periods 1984-1999, 1999-2005, and 2005-2009, respectively. In addition to these LULC changes, evidence of land degradation processes was observed, which were mainly due to human activities, such as the formation of quarries, free water bodies and Sabkhas (a specific type of land cover found on drylands and salt-affected soils). Based on the identified causes of these changes, we made policy recommendations for better management of LULC. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This increase is associated with land use and land cover (LULC) changes. This LULC directly modifies larval habitats and affect the anopheline larval distribution patterns.Methods: In this survey, effects of LULC changes on the distribution of anopheline larval habitats in Meghalaya over a three year period (April 2008 to March 2011) was observed. Mosquito density and diversity of neighbouring four villages located along natural swamps (less disturbed) were compared with 16 villages located near disturbed area (cultivated area, urban area, pastures land area and national highway area).Results: The association between LULC type and occurrence of anopheline larvae was statistically significant. The distribution of anopheline positive habitats varied significantly between seasons. The mean density of Anopheles was significantly higher in urban area in all the seasons, but higher in farm land and pasture land areas only in rainy and post-rainy seasons. The six most common species collected were Anopheles maculatus (19.2%), An. vagus (13.7%), An. annularis (9.1%), An. philippinensis (8.1%), An. barbirostris (5.1%) and An. minimus (4.6%).

It is critical in planning, monitoring, and management programs at various local and national levels. Monitoring changes in LULC patterns over time is crucial for understanding evolving landscapes. Traditionally, LULC classification has been achieved through satellite data by remote sensing, geographic sifiers, and deep learning models. Semantic segmentation, a technique for assigning land cover classes to individual pixels in an image, is commonly employed for LULC mapping. In recent years, the deep learning revolution, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has reshaped the field of computer vision and LULC classification. Deep architectures have consistently outperformed traditional methods, offering greater accuracy and efficiency. However, the availability of high-quality datasets has been a limiting factor. Bridging the gap between modern computer vision and remote sensing data analysis can revolutionize our understanding of the environment and drive breakthroughs in urban planning and ecosystem change research. The ""Sen-2 LULC Dataset"" has been created to facilitate this convergence. This dataset comprises of 213,761 pre-processed 10 m resolution images representing seven LULC classes. These classes encompass water bodies, dense forests, sparse forests, barren land, built-up areas, agricultural land, and fallow land. Importantly, each image may contain multiple coexisting land use and land cover classes, mirroring the real-world complexity of landscapes. The dataset is derived from Sentinel2 satellite imagery sourced from the Copernicus Open Access Hub ( https://scihub.copernicus.eu/ ) platform. It includes spectral bands B4, B3, and B2, corresponding to red, green, and blue (RGB) channels, and offers a spectral resolution of 10 m. The dataset also provides an equal number of mask images. Structured into six folders, the dataset offers training, testing, and validation sets for images and masks. Researchers across various domains can leverage this resource to advance LULC classification in the context of the Indian region.

A hybrid supervised/ unsupervised classification approach coupled with GIS analyses was employed to generate land use/cover maps from which various class level landscape metrics were calculated using FRAGSTATS (R), in order to analyse landscape fragmentation. The results show that agriculture, mixed rangeland, settlements, bareland and water increased, while woodland areas decreased. Consequently, the landscape became more highly fragmented as indicated by an increase in the patch number and a decrease in the mean patch size (MPS) of the woodland and mixed rangeland classes.

However, the interactions between complex topography and land use/cover patterns remain unclear. To explore this concern, a study was performed in the Altay region, Xinjiang, which is a typical region with multiple geomorphic and land use/cover types. Topographic variables, including elevation, slope, aspect, relief amplitude, topographic wetness index (TWI), surface solar radiation value (SRV) and land use/cover diversity indexes (LDIs) were extracted and calculated. Firstly, the dominant distribution area of each land use/cover type was calculated by a topographic distribution index, and the results showed that forest and steppe land covers were mainly distributed on mountains with slopes > 5 degrees, small relief platforms and hills and large relief mountains; agricultural, urban, water and Gobi desert land uses/covers were concentrated on plains, gently rolling hills and low mountains with slopes < 5 with elevation of approximately 800 m. Further research indicated that the moving-window method providing the characteristic scale of land use/cover diversity was 210 m, and the spatial distributions of the LDIs were obtained. Combined with landscape structure information entropy (LSIE), the results showed that the LDIs and LSIE were highest on plains, hills and low-mountains. Regularity occurred between landform and land use/ cover: a higher elevation, greater relief amplitude, higher TWI, and gentle slope resulted in a simpler land use/ cover type and smaller LDIs. The interrelationships between LDIs and topographic variables were evaluated via redundancy analysis (RDA) and Spearman correlation coefficient analysis, and results indicated that elevation, slope and TWI, strongly influenced the land use/cover diversity and pattern.

The hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) allowed one to classify the water-quality monitoring stations in three groups in the fall/winter season. The factor analysis (FA) with a rotation of the axis (varimax) was adopted to identify the most significant water-quality variables of the system (turbidity and flow). Finally, another PCA was run to link water-quality variables to the dominant land uses of the watershed. Strong correlations between TP and agriculture-land use, TP and livestock farming, NT and urban areas arose. It was found that these multivariate exploratory tools can provide a proper overview of the water-quality behavior in space and time and the correlations between water-quality variables and land use.",land use,land cover,water quality,nutrients,multicriteria statistical analysis,Santa Lucia watershed,,"Alonso, Jimena","Chreties, Christian","Fossati, Monica",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, in this study, we looked into how various land uses and changes in land cover affect the water quality in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Land use and land cover change maps were generated from 1991 to 2021 at intervals of five years. On the basis of the weighted arithmetic water quality index approach, the water quality for the same years was likewise divided into five classes. The relationship between land use/land cover dynamics and water quality was then evaluated using correlations, multiple linear regressions, and principal component analysis. According to the computed water quality index, the water quality decreased from 65.34 in 1991 to 246.76 in 2021. The built-up area showed an increase of over 338%, whereas the amount of water decreased by over 61%. While barren land exhibited a negative correlation with nitrates, ammonia loadings, total alkalinity, and total hardness of the water, agriculture and built-up areas positively correlated with water quality parameters such as nutrient loading, turbidity, total alkalinity, and total hardness. A principal component analysis revealed that built up areas and changes in vegetated areas have the biggest impact on water quality. These findings suggest that land use and land cover modifications are involved in the deterioration of water quality around the city.

Remotely sensed images are commonly used for land cover classification but hardly identifies urban land use and functional areas because of the semantic gap (i.e., different definitions of similar or identical buildings). Social media data, ""marks"" left by people using mobile phones, have great potential to overcome this semantic gap. Multisource remote sensing data are also expected to be useful in distinguishing different LULC types. This study examined the capability of combined multisource remote sensing images and social media data in urban LULC classification. Multisource remote sensing images included a Chinese ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) high-resolution image, a Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) multispectral image, and a Sentinel-1A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image. Social media data consisted of the hourly spatial distribution of WeChat users, which is a ubiquitous messaging and payment platform in China. LULC was classified into 10 types, namely, vegetation, bare land, road, water, urban village, greenhouses, residential, commercial, industrial, and educational buildings. A method that integrates object-based image analysis, decision trees, and random forests was used for LULC classification. The overall accuracy and kappa value attained by the combination of multisource remote sensing images and WeChat data were 87.55% and 0.84, respectively. They further improved to 91.55% and 0.89, respectively, by integrating the textural and spatial features extracted from the ZY-3 image. The ZY-3 high-resolution image was essential for urban LULC classification because it is necessary for the accurate delineation of land parcels. The addition of Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel-1A SAR, or WeChat data also made an irreplaceable contribution to the classification of different LULC types. The Landsat 8 OLI image helped distinguish between the urban village, residential buildings, commercial buildings, and roads, while the Sentinel-1A SAR data reduced the confusion between commercial buildings, greenhouses, and water.

As the majority of RSI is high-resolution and contains wide and varied data, proper interpretation of RSIs is most important. Land use and land cover (LULC) classification utilizing deep learning (DL) is a common and efficient manner in remote sensing and geospatial study. It is very important in land planning, environmental monitoring, mapping, and land management. But, one of the recent approaches is problems like vulnerability to noise interference, low classification accuracy, and worse generalization ability. DL approaches, mostly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) revealed impressive performance in image recognition tasks, making them appropriate for LULC classification in RSIs. Therefore, this study introduces a novel Land Use and Land Cover Classification employing the River Formation Dynamics Algorithm with Deep Learning (LULCC-RFDADL) technique on RSIs.

In the presented LULCC-RFDADL technique, the dense EfficientNet approach is applied for feature extraction. Furthermore, the hyperparameter tuning of the Dense EfficientNet method was implemented using the RFDA technique. For the classification process, the LULCC-RFDADL technique uses the Multi-Scale Convolutional Autoencoder (MSCAE) model. At last, the seeker optimization algorithm (SOA) has been exploited for the parameter choice of the MSCAE system.

However, large discrepancies in the existing LULC datasets have hindered our efforts to better understand interactions among human activities, climate systems, and ecosystem in India. In this study, we incorporated high-resolution remote sensing datasets from Resourcesat-1 and historical archives at district (N = 590) and state (N = 30) levels to generate LULC datasets at 5 arc minute resolution during 1880-2010 in India. Results have shown that a significant loss of forests (from 89 million ha to 63 million ha) has occurred during the study period. Interestingly, the deforestation rate was relatively greater under the British rule (1880-1950s) and early decades after independence, and then decreased after the 1980s due to government policies to protect the forests. In contrast to forests, cropland area has increased from 92 million ha to 140.1 million ha during 1880-2010. Greater cropland expansion has occurred during the 1950-1980s that coincided with the period of farm mechanization, electrification, and introduction of high yielding crop varieties as a result of government policies to achieve self-sufficiency in food production. The rate of urbanization was slower during 1880-1940 but significantly increased after the 1950s probably due to rapid increase in population and economic growth in India. Our study provides the most reliable estimations of historical LULC at regional scale in India. This is the first attempt to incorporate newly developed high-resolution remote sensing datasets and inventory archives to reconstruct the time series of LULC records for such a long period in India. The spatial and temporal information on LULC derived from this study could be used by ecosystem, hydrological, and climate modeling as well as by policy makers for assessing the impacts of LULC on regional climate, water resources, and biogeochemical cycles in terrestrial ecosystems.

The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between large-scale agricultural investment and the socioecological implications of land use change in western Ethiopia. We used black and white aerial photographs of 1967 and Landsat satellite images from 1977 to 2019, taken at 10-year study intervals, SPOT-6 imagery and qualitative data to understand better the complex interactions between large-scale agricultural investments and the socioecological effects of land use change. The dynamics of LULC changes for each period were classified using a hybrid approach combining the outputs of supervised classification, intensive on-screen digitising techniques and qualitative data from interviews and focus group discussions. The results indicated that small-scale cultivated and settlement land, commercial farmland, grassland and shrubland increased by 120%, 137%, 89% and 65%, respectively, between 1967 and 2019. In contrast, over those six decades, forest, woodland, wetland and water bodies declined by 49%, 76%, 10% and 16%, respectively. The results of the qualitative data also showed that land leasing for agricultural investments and subsistence agriculture leads to socio-environmental changes such as reduced forest cover, biodiversity loss and wetland degradation, which lead to loss of livelihood and marginalisation of local communities. As a result, a wide range of policy packages for socio-environmental issues are required to avoid the adverse effects of land leasing in the study area and other parts of Ethiopia.",Agricultural investments,Land acquisitions,Land use policy,Socio-environmental change,Tropical forest ecosystem,,,"Damene, Shimeles","Budds, Jessica",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many land use activities, including agriculture, urban development, mining, and commercial forestry, tend to be sources of diffuse pollution. By contrast, indigenous vegetation can act as a sink, thus providing some protection from diffuse anthropogenic contamination. Notwithstanding the large body of research demonstrating these facts, decision-makers require clear and accessible information to assist them in developing effective management plans that are fully cognisant of the manifold impacts of LULC on water resources. Reviewing the available literature, this article offers a critical overview of the typical impacts of LULC on water quality. An important strategy for managing water quality highlighted in this article is the maintenance of a sufficient amount of unfragmented natural vegetation, not only within riparian zones but also across catchment areas. However, knowledge gaps identified in this review indicate that further context-specific research is required to determine not only the types and minimum amount of vegetative cover required to protect water resources from diffuse pollution but also the potential impact of landscape fragmentation on the ability of natural vegetation to protect water resources. A critical discussion of these factors is therefore provided.",diffuse pollution,integrated catchment management,land cover,land use,water quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In total, six openly available pan-European geodata sets, i.e., CORINE, Natura 2000, Riparian Zones, Urban Atlas, OpenStreetMap, and LUCAS in combination with about 1500 Landsat-7/8 scenes were used to generate land use and land cover information for three large-scale focus regions in Europe using the TimeTools processing framework. This fully automated preprocessing chain integrates data acquisition, radiometric, atmospheric and topographic correction, spectral-temporal feature extraction, as well as supervised classification based on a random forest classifier. In addition to the evaluation of the six different geodata sets and their combinations for automated training data generation, aspects such as spatial sampling strategies, inter and intraclass homogeneity of training data, as well as the effects of additional features, such as topography and texture metrics are evaluated. In particular, the CORINE data set showed, with up to 70% overall accuracy, high potential as a source for deriving dominant LU/LC information with minimal manual effort. The intraclass homogeneity within the training data set was of central relevance for improving the quality of the results. The high potential of the proposed approach was corroborated through a comparison with two similar LU/LC data sets, i.e., GlobeLand30 and the Copernicus High Resolution Layers. While similar accuracy levels could be observed for the latter, for the former, accuracy was considerable lower by about 12-24%.",land use,land cover,classification,Copernicus,open geodata,CORINE,LUCAS,"Ottinger, Marco","Mack, Benjamin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Landsat,,,,,,,,,,,

Land use change is sensitive to whether economic or ecological profits dominate, and prediction of future land use changes has become an important scientific issue. This article constructs a coupled model that comprises the grey model (GM), the fuzzy multiple objective linear programming model (FMOLP) and the future land use simulation model (FLUS). We used this model to calculate a macro-scale quantitative forecast using the top-down GM-FMOLP model, and calculated micro-scale spatial simulations of land use/cover change (LUCC) using the bottom-up FLUS model under three dissimilar future scenarios, with different emphases on ecological and economic benefits. The scenarios were designed to meet different planning requirements in Chongqing: ecological benefits maximization, economic benefits maximization, and combined ecological and economic benefits maximization. The proposed model, FLUS, was applied to a LUCC simulation for Chongqing in 2015, beginning from verified historical land use data from 2010. The results show that the simulation agrees well with the actual land use in 2015. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient are 85.92% and 0.76, respectively, which indicates the model performs well. The three land use types with the highest producer and user accuracies are forest, cropland and water areas. The GM-FMOLP model was used to forecast future LUCC quantity demand, and the FLUS model was then used to calculate spatial predictions for the three scenarios for 2040. The prediction results for the six land use types were significantly different under the three different scenarios. The total areas of forest, urban land and water increased by different degrees under the three scenarios, and the unused land area dwindled. Cropland areas were largely converted into forest, urban land and water areas. The increases in forest and urban land areas generally represents internal gap-filling between disparate areas and peripheral expansion of areas of the same land use type. The increase in water area results from increased surface runoff in mountainous valleys with severe terrain. Areas of unused land are fully transformed into other land use types. The outcomes from the designed scenarios demonstrate that the proposed models are reliable and effective for future LUCC simulation, and highlight key areas where land use changes differently according to the scenario. In summary, in the predictions for the scenario that combined ecological and economic benefits maximization, each land use type tried to maximize ecological and economic benefits under the constraints, taking into account ecological safety and economic growth, which is in line with the coordination, comprehensiveness and binding requirements in Chongqing's development plan. Therefore, this scenario becomes the optimal scenario for land use optimization in Chongqing in the future. This study provides an example of the application of simulation and forecast models in land use management, remediation and urban planning, and addresses the growing requirement for low-cost and effective tools for prediction of dynamic land use succession patterns.",Chongqing,coupled model,land use simulation,land use,cover change (LUCC),multiple scenarios,,"He, Zhiming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The trans-boundary Gandaki River Basin (GRB) is the part of Central Himalayas, a tributary of Ganges mega-river basin plays a crucial role on LUCC and ecosystem services. Due to the large topographic variances, the basin has existed various land cover types including cropland, forest cover, built-up area, river/lake, wetland, snow/glacier, grassland, barren land and bush/shrub. This study used Landsat 5-TM (1990), Landsat 8-OLI (2015) satellite image and existing national land cover database of Nepal of the year 1990 to analyze LUCC and impact on ecosystem service values between 1990 and 2015. Supervised classification with maximum likelihood algorithm was applied to obtain the various land cover types. To estimate the ecosystem services values, this study used coefficients values of ecosystem services delivered by each land cover class. The combined use of GIS and remote sensing analysis has revealed that grassland and snow cover decreased from 10.62% to 7.62% and 9.55% to 7.27%, respectively compared to other land cover types during the 25 years study period.

The four quantified scenarios (A1B, A2, B1, and B2) served as input to the forecasting scenarios of land-use change (FORE-SCE) model. Four spatially explicit data sets consistent with scenario storylines were produced for the conterminous United States, with annual LULC maps from 1992 through 2100. The future projections are characterized by a loss of natural land covers in most scenarios, with corresponding expansion of anthropogenic land uses. Along with the loss of natural land covers, remaining natural land covers experience increased fragmentation under most scenarios, with only the B2 scenario remaining relatively stable in both the proportion of remaining natural land covers and basic fragmentation measures. Forest stand age was also modeled. By 2100, scenarios and ecoregions with heavy forest cutting had relatively lower mean stand ages compared to those with less forest cutting. Stand ages differed substantially between unprotected and protected forest lands, as well as between different forest classes. The modeled data were compared to the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and other data sources to assess model characteristics.

The 2018 image results showed kappa coefficients of the dry season and wet season of 0.90 and 0.845, respectively. There was a continuous decline in woodland (29.38%) and riparian vegetation (47.11%) and an increasing trend in shrub bush land (35.28%), grassland (43.47%), bare land (27.52%), and cultivated land (118.36 km(2)) over the thirty-year period.

Around KSNP, the local communities' livelihood depends on farming (crop and livestock production). This expansion of farming is the main driver of woodland depletion, which leads to increased resource competition and a challenge for the survival of wildlife.

In this study, we present an observation-based analysis of climate sensitivity to LCLUC based on decadal LCLUC and climate data in different ecoregions. Our results revealed that variations in land surface temperature and vapor pressure were most sensitive to LCLUC across the conterminous United States, while precipitation was less sensitive. Persistent warming effects were produced from LCLUC in Appalachian and some of the central U.S., High Plains, and northwest ecoregions, but cooling effects were evident in the many southeast, northeast and some Great Lakes and Intermountain West ecoregions. Most of the warming and a few cooling ecoregions were sensitive to LCLUC. Ecoregions with increasing vapor pressure were found across the Great Plains, Intermountain West, and West Coast ecoregions and several of these regions in the Great Plains and West Coast were sensitive to LCLUC. A combination of changes in temperature, precipitation, and vapor pressure was used to characterize climate sensitivity associated with LCLUC forcing, and five major persistent patterns were found in some ecoregions.

In this study, the relationship between LULC change and stormwater runoff quality in two separate monitoring sites comprising a construction area (Site 1) and mixed land use (Site 2) was analyzed using geographic information system (GIS), event mean concentration (EMC), and correlation analysis. It was detected that bare land area increased, while other land use areas such as agriculture, commercial, forest, grassland, parking lot, residential, and road reduced. Based on the analyses performed, high maximum range and average EMCs were found in Site 2 for most of the water pollutants. Also, urban areas and increased conversion of LULC into bare land corresponded to degradation of stormwater quality. Correlation analysis between LULC and stormwater quality showed the influence of different factors such as farming practices, geographical location, and amount of precipitation, vegetation loss, and anthropogenic activities in monitoring sites.

They harbor many endemic species, as well as a large proportion of the population, and offer diverse ecosystem services. These regions are subjected to anthropogenic impacts derived from agriculture and livestock farming, which have caused land degradation and desertification. In addition, these ecosystems are highly sensitive to climate variability and projected global environmental change. However, information about how land use/land cover change and climate variability processes overlap and synergize each other in these ecoregions is scattered in different publications, and it is desirable to integrate it to provides more complete information for decision making. In this study we describe both land cover and land use changes in the five arid and semi-arid ecoregions in Mexico (Sonoran, Chihuahuan, Tamaulipan, Mexican High Plateau and Tehuacan-Cuicatlan valley) between 2002 and 2011, and their current exposure to droughts, low temperatures, floods and tropical cyclones. These results are discussed in terms of regional climate trends documented in the literature. We found that land use and land cover change differ between ecoregions, with the Sonoran and Chihuahuan ecoregions being the least affected. The overall exposure to extreme climate events is high in all ecoregions except for the Tehuacan-Cuicatlan valley, although each region has different exposure profiles. Observed trends for all ecoregions generally point towards an increase in both maximum and minimum temperatures, while trends for precipitation are less clear.

A shape index was calculated for each land cover polygon inside a GIS. Information on land cover change was analysed with reference to land cover class and the polygon shape index using a regression analysis.Results For upland seminatural land cover classes, subject to low levels of management, change is related to polygon shape, such that the more complex patches were found to be more susceptible to change. This relationship breaks down where classes are more intensively managed or have been aggregated into mosaic classes.Conclusions Propensity to change was related to shape index for seminatural land cover classes. This implies that at least some landscape processes, such as anthropogenic disturbance of seminatural land covers, can be linked to ecological theory via measurements of spatial pattern. The study also highlighted some of the cartographic issues involved in estimating changes between land cover classes: there are advantages in replacing the 'cartographic paradigm' of comparing two derived datasets (in this case land cover maps) with direct comparison of the digital data - air photographs or satellite imagery.

Remote sensing approaches for observing and monitoring change vary depending on the geographic scope, ecological complexity, and the information required to understand ecosystem interactions. Strategies based on identifying spectral variability are useful for targeting areas of rapid change. Measuring changes in land cover biophysical properties requires a more complex approach, where different dates of remotely sensed data are transformed to such variables as surface imperviousness, canopy structure, and phenology, and then compared.

The results indicated that the maximum runoff and soil loss were found in bare land (BL), but the minimum runoff and soil loss were detected in cropland and grassland, respectively. Among the 16 land use subtypes, BL left for natural succession had the highest runoff, but the lowest runoff was found in orchard with contact cover; the soil loss was largest for cropland without conservation measures, while the minimum value was detected in natural shrubland. When the vegetation coverage exceeded 60%, runoff and soil loss both tended to reach a stable rate. Land use with a multi-layer vegetation structure or ground/contact cover or broadleaf plant had less runoff and lower sediment values. In addition, soil loss decreased sharply during the initial 3 y of vegetation restoration, and then slowly declined until reaching a relatively stable rate after 15 y of succession.

Both metrics were developed based on the surface energy balance, and provided insight into the contribution of different aspects of land surface change (such as albedo, surface roughness, net radiation and surface heat fluxes) to changing climate. A revision of the first metric, the intrinsic biophysical mechanism, can be used to distinguish the direct and indirect effects of LCLUC on surface temperature. The other, a decomposed temperature metric, gives a straightforward depiction of separate contributions of all components of the surface energy balance. These two metrics well capture observed and model simulated surface temperature changes in response to LCLUC. Results from paired FLUXNET sites and land surface model sensitivity experiments indicate that surface roughness effects usually dominate the direct biogeophysical feedback of LCLUC, while other effects play a secondary role. However, coupled climate model experiments show that these direct effects can be attenuated by large scale atmospheric changes (indirect feedbacks). When applied to real-time transient LCLUC experiments, the metrics also demonstrate usefulness for assessing the performance of climate models and quantifying land-atmosphere interactions in response to LCLUC.",biogeophysical feedbacks,land cover change,metrics,surface temperature,modeling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the 1990 s and early 2000 s, there was a conscious government drive to leverage oil palm plantation development. This led to the growth in the size of oil palm plantations within the RFAZ landscape, considering the zone's conducive natural environment. However, between 2008 and 2022, corresponding to the period of the increased promotion of rubber cultivation through the Outgrower project in the RFAZ, rubber plantations became the predominant land use, with an area of 11,763.81 ha in 2008 and 21,611.61 ha in 2022. The results from the LULC mapping and the intensity analysis showed that the Rubber Outgrowers Plantation Project (ROPP) and Norpalm Smallholder Scheme Project (NSSP) have degraded the natural cover through rubber and oil palm cultivation. The authors conclude that landscape dynamics, particularly in rainforest agroecological zones, represent a nexus challenge transforming policy adaptation's discursive context. The study recommends that agriculture and landscape policy/projects must have/ take intermediary steps to address the feedback/trade-offs from well-intended initiatives. The study further suggests that management plans and strategies in the RFAZ should be consistent with the strict protection of forest reserves and water bodies.",Intensity analysis,Oil palm plantation,Land use/land cover change,Rain Forest Agroecological Zone,Rubber plantation,food security,,"Fuerst, Christine","Nyarko, Benjamin Kofi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of land use on biodiversity manifest primarily at local scales which are not captured by the coarse spatial grain of current global land-use mapping. Assessments of land-use impacts on biodiversity across large spatial extents require data at a similar spatial grain to the ecological processes they are assessing. Here, we develop a method for statistically downscaling mapped land-use data that combines generalized additive modeling and constrained optimization. This method was applied to the 0.5 degrees Land-use Harmonization data for the year 2005 to produce global 30 '' (approx. 1 km(2)) estimates of five land-use classes: primary habitat, secondary habitat, cropland, pasture, and urban. The original dataset was partitioned into 61 bio-realms (unique combinations of biome and biogeographical realm) and downscaled using relationships with fine-grained climate, land cover, landform, and anthropogenic influence layers. The downscaled land-use data were validated using the PREDICTS database and the geoWiki global cropland dataset. Application of the new method to all 61 biorealms produced global fine-grained layers from the 2005 time step of the Land-use Harmonization dataset. Coarse-scaled proportions of land use estimated from these data compared well with those estimated in the original datasets (mean R-2: 0.68 +/- 0.19). Validation with the PREDICTS database showed the new downscaled land-use layers improved discrimination of all five classes at PREDICTS sites (P < 0.0001 in all cases). Additional validation of the downscaled cropping layer with the geoWiki layer showed an R-2 improvement of 0.12 compared with the Land-use Harmonization data. The downscaling method presented here produced the first global land-use dataset at a spatial grain relevant to ecological processes that drive changes in biodiversity over space and time. Integrating these data with biodiversity measures will enable the reporting of land-use impacts on biodiversity at a finer resolution than previously possible. Furthermore, the general method presented here could be useful to others wishing to downscale similarly constrained coarse-resolution data for other environmental variables.",Constrained optimization,global change,land cover,land use,landscape modification,statistical downscaling,,"Harwood, Tom","Hudson, Lawrence N.","Ware, Chris","Williams, Kristen J.","Ferrier, Simon",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the difference between land use and land cover and their implications in ecology is often overlooked. The impacts of urban land cover composition and configuration on land surface temperature (LST) have been extensively investigated, but few studies have explored the relation between LST and land use category. This research takes the inner city of Shanghai as a case and comprehensively investigates the discrepant impacts of land use and land cover on LST. Land use and land cover data are derived respectively from aerial photography and high-resolution satellite imagery (ALOS), and the LST is estimated from Landsat TM images. There are five dominant land use types (new residential, old residential, villas, industrial, and institutional land use) and two major land cover types (vegetated and impervious land cover) in the study area. For most land use types, the land cover composition and configuration are varied. By contrast, no statistical difference is observed among old residential, industrial and institutional land uses for LST. The mean LST of new residential and industrial land use is significantly different, although their land cover compositions and configurations are quite similar. These results indicate that the key factors affecting urban LST are not only land cover patterns, but also other anthropogenic forces. Therefore, the explanation of urban LST by land cover alone is inadequate. Especially at fine spatial scales, information on land use is more meaningful than that of land cover to indicate the impacts of urbanization on ecosystems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The long-term temporal and seasonal changes in LULC have a substantial influence on groundwater flow dynamics. Therefore, assessment of the impacts of LULC changes on recharge is necessary for the sustainable management of groundwater resources. The objective of this study is to examine the effects of LULC changes on groundwater recharge in the northwestern part of Bangladesh. Spatially distributed monthly groundwater recharge was simulated using a semi-physically based water balance model. Long-term temporal LULC change analysis was conducted using LULC maps from 2006 to 2016, while wet and dry LULC maps were used to examine seasonal changes. The results show that the impervious built-up area has increased by 80.3%, whereas vegetated land cover has decreased by 16.4% over the study period. As a result, groundwater recharge in 2016 has decreased compared to the level seen in 2006. However, the decrease in recharge due to long-term temporal LULC changes is very small at the basin scale (2.6 mm/year), although the impact on regional level is larger (17.1 mm/year) due to urbanization. Seasonal LULC variations also affect recharge due to the higher potential for dry seasonal LULC compared to the wet seasonal LULC, a substantial difference (20.6 mm/year).

A case in point is Amazonia, a large, data-poor region where most whole-basin data sets are limited to understanding land cover interpreted through a variety of remote sensing techniques and sensors. A growing body of work, however, indicates that the future state of much of Amazonia depends on the land use to which converted areas are put, but land use in the tropics is difficult to assess from remotely sensed data alone. An earlier paper developed new snapshots of agricultural land use in this region using a statistical fusion of satellite data and agricultural census data, an underutilized ancillary data source available across Amazonia. The creation of these land-use maps, which have the spatial detail of a satellite image and the attribute information of an agricultural census, required the development of a new statistical technique for merging data sets at different scales and of fundamentally different data types. Here we describe and assess this nonlinear technique, which reinterprets existing land cover classifications by determining what categories are most highly related to the polygon land-use data across the study area.

Biodiversity conservation, management of protected areas and sustainable development with strategies targeting rural populations are current challenges in Africa, in the context of exponential human population growth, overexploitation of natural resources, forest destruction and climate change. The Quirimbas National Park (QNP) has been suffering from severe and constant threats originating from different sources and changes in land use and land cover. These changes, and in the context of global climate change, pose permanent challenges to the managers of this conservation area of Mozambique. The research aimed to analyze the historical and recent LULC over the last 38 years, to provide consistent and scientific information for decision making on biodiversity conservation approaches; to identify the main changes and their impacts on the ecosystem to implement/develop appropriate mitigation strategies. A combined and integrated methodological approach has been developed from satellite imagery analyzes of Landsat 2 and 5 MSS (Multispectral Scanner); Landsat 5 TM (Thematic Mapper), Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager), and fieldwork (field observation and communities and QNP staff meetings). The results show that the overall map classification obtained was between very good and excellent: 1979 - Kappa 71.84%, Overall Accuracy 86.55%; 1989 - Kappa 83.49%, Overall Accuracy 93.01%; 1999 - Kappa 85.03%, Overall Accuracy 90.07%; 2009 - Kappa 79.57%, Overall Accuracy 86.42%; 2017 - Kappa 80.24%, Overall Accuracy 86.95%.

Especially in relation to global climate change, cities play a major role considering the impacts of extreme heat waves on the population. For urban planners, it is important to know which types of urban structures are beneficial for a comfortable urban climate and which actions can be taken to improve urban climate conditions. Therefore, it is essential to differ between not only urban and rural environments, but also between different levels of urban densification. To compare these built-up types within different cities worldwide, Stewart and Oke developed the concept of local climate zones (LCZ) defined by morphological characteristics. The original LCZ scheme often has considerable problems when adapted to European cities with historical city centers, including narrow streets and irregular patterns. In this study, a method to bridge the gap between a classical land use/land cover (LULC) classification and the LCZ scheme is presented. Multitemporal Landsat 8 data are used to create a high accuracy LULC map, which is linked to the LCZ by morphological parameters derived from a high-resolution digital surface model and cadastral data. A bijective combination of the different classification schemes could not be achieved completely due to overlapping threshold values and the spatially homogeneous distribution of morphological parameters, but the attribution of LCZ to the LULC classification was successful.

For the past few decades, remotely sensed information on land cover has been used as useful alternative to ground observations and has proved to be a robust tool for studying land use i land cover (LULC) changes. The present work deals with the assessment of land-cover changes in a Mediterranean country - Greece, where expected climate change impacts and desertification risk are stated to be severe. This work focused on the CORINE land cover inventory at a spatial resolution of 100 m from 1990 to 2018 and selected Landsat images at 30 m spatial resolution for 1990, 2000 and 2018. Results indicated that the dominant land-cover changes in Greece over the predefined 29-year period, are related to land transformation from Non-irrigated arable land to Irrigated areas, implying an intensification of agricultural practices. Natural grasslands lose a substantial part of their areas transforming into Sclerophyllus vegetation and Sparsely vegetated areas. Forests gain areas from Transitional woodland-shrub and Olive groves increase their extent indicating an overall transition to woody vegetation. Estimation of Vegetation Carbon Stocks indicated a moderate decrease in the 1990 decade followed by a significant increase up to 2012 and a slight decrease thereafter. Forests of all types are by far the most important carbon sinks. Possible implications of country's recent economic crisis were examined and results indicated that economic welfare of the country seems to favor certain land cover types such as Mixed Forests and Permanently Irrigated land, but also preservation of the Vegetation Carbon Stocks.

In contrast, land cover fraction mapping enables expressing the proportion of each pure class in each pixel, which increases precision and reduces legend complexity. To map land cover fractions, regression rather than classification algorithms are needed, and multiple approaches are available for this task. A major challenge for land cover fraction mapping models is data sparsity. Land cover fraction data is by its nature zero-inflated due to how common the 0% fraction is. As regression favours the mean, 0% and 100% fractions are difficult for regression models to predict accurately. We proposed a new solution by combining three models: a binary model determines whether a pixel is pure; if so, it is processed using a classification model; otherwise with a regression model. We compared multiple regression algorithms and implemented our proposed three-step model on the algorithm with the lowest RMSE. We further evaluated the spatial and per-class accuracy of the model and demonstrated a wall-to-wall prediction of seven land cover fractions over the globe. The models were trained on over 138,000 points and validated on a separate dataset of over 20,000 points, provided by the CGLS-LC100 project. Both datasets are global and aligned with the PROBA-V 100 m UTM grid. Results showed that the random forest regression model reached the lowest RMSE of 17.3%. Lowest MAE (7.9%) and highest overall accuracy (72% ? 2%) was achieved using random forest with our proposed threemodel approach and median vote. This research proves that machine learning algorithms can be applied globally to map a wide variety of land cover fractions. Fraction mapping expresses land cover more precisely, and empowers users to create their own discrete maps using user-defined thresholds and rules, which enables customising the result for a diverse range of uses. The three-step approach is useful for addressing the zero-inflation issue and mapping 0% and 100% fractions more accurately, and thus has already been taken up in the operational production of global land cover fraction layers within the CGLS-LC100 project. Furthermore, this study contributes to the accuracy assessment of land cover fraction maps both thematically and spatially, and these methods could be taken up by future land cover fraction mapping efforts.",PROBA-V,Global land cover mapping,Land cover fraction mapping,Time series analysis,Machine learning,Random forest,Cubist,"Lesiv, Myroslava","Buchhorn, Marcel","Verbesselt, Jan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Support vector regression,Neural network,,,,,,Spatial accuracy,Zero inflation,,,

In this study, LULC changes were examined in part of Guizhou Province of southern China from 1991 to 2001 based on Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images of November 7, 1991, December 5, 1994, and December 19, 2001. Land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were computed based on LULC types. The results show that agricultural land decreased, while urban areas expanded dramatically. and forest land increased slightly. Barren land increased from 1991 to 1994, and then decreased from 1994 to 2001. These changes in LULC widened the temperature difference between the urban and the rural areas. The change in LST was mainly associated with changes in construction materials in the urban area and in vegetation abundance both in the urban and rural areas. Vegetation had a dual function in tile temperatures of different LULC types. While it could ease the warming trend in the urban or built-up areas, it helped to keep other lands warmer in the cold weather.

EO-1 Hyperion data of October 05, 2012 covering parts of Bengaluru city was analyzed for land cover classification. The hyperspectral data was initially corrected for atmospheric effects using MODTRAN based FLAASH module and Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) transformation was applied to reduce data dimensionality. The threshold Eigen value of 1.76 in VNIR region and 1.68 in the SWIR region was used for selection of 145 stable bands. Advanced per pixel classifiers viz., Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were used for general urban land cover classification. Accuracy assessment of the classified data revealed that SVM was quite superior (82.4 per cent) for urban land cover classification as compared to SAM (67.1 per cent). Selecting training samples using end members significantly improved the classification accuracy by 20.1 per cent in SVM. The land cover classification using multispectral LISS-III data using SVM showed lower accuracy mainly due to limitation of spectral resolution. The study indicated the requirement of additional narrow bands for achieving reasonable classification accuracy of urban land cover. Future research is focused on generating hyperspectral library for different urban features.",Hyperion,MNF,Urban,Land cover,Spectral Angle Mapper,Support Vector Machine,,"Raj, Uday",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ISPRS TECHNICAL COMMISSION VIII SYMPOSIUM,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been argued that this may be achieved using a two-stage region-based approach, where initially derived land cover parcels (regions) are subsequently analysed, in terms of their spatial and morphological structure, to infer land use. Although initial results of the above approach have been promising, little work to date has been conducted into quantifying its scale dependence. This is particularly the case in relation to how inferred region morphology and spatial composition changes as a function of image spatial resolution. In order to address this issue this paper employs fine scale land cover digital map data to generate simulated classified images at resolutions of between 2-6m. Subsequent region-based structural analysis shows that inferred region morphology, particularly for man-made objects (buildings and roads), is severely degraded at spatial resolutions below 2m, making the inference of certain residential land use types problematic. The implication of these findings are that for certain spatially fragmented residential types, characterised by a relatively large number of small detached houses, region-based structural inference of urban land use using multispectral images acquired by sensors such as IKONOS-1 (4m) is likely to be problematic.",urban land use,land cover structure,scale sensitivity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GEOINFORMATION FOR EUROPEAN-WIDE INTEGRATION,,,,,,,,,,,,

The enormous rate of population growth, industrialization, and urbanization is responsible for these developments. Monitoring and mapping of changes in land cover and land use is essential to the sustainable development and management of the area. The study attempts to track changes in LULC pattern for the years 2002, 2013, and 2023 in the Hindon River Basin, a major tributary of the Yamuna River, using remote sensing and geographic information system techniques. Images obtained from Landsat data were employed to extract historical land use and land cover maps. Additionally, the CA-Markov model was implemented to forecast future land use and land cover patterns. This study examines the historical and predicted LULC in the area. Field observations and site-specific interviews were used to confirm and determine the ground realities. High-resolution images were used to evaluate the accuracy of the classified map. According to the results, the agricultural land decreased from 60.98% in 2002 to 54.70% in 2050, while built-up areas increased from 12.95% to 21.25% during the same period. By 2050, vegetation is predicted to increase to 2.58%, whereas surface water, fallow land, barren areas, and dry water bodies are predicted to decrease to 0.58%, 18.87%, 1.20%, and 0.83%, respectively. The rapid pace of urbanization is facilitating economic growth within the country; however, this development is occurring at the expense of the natural landscape, which subsequently diminishes the overall quality of human life. In order to maintain sustainable development in the Hindon Basin, proper urban planning is essential.

This analysis consisted of the entire Malacca River watershed area. Changes may provide information on determinant of river water quality in future. Based on LULC monitoring and future simulation approach, the results may be used in an early warning system by demonstrating trend and consequences of changes in watershed. Continuous downward trends for vegetation area, open space area, and water bodies are due to expansion in non-industrial area, industrial area, and farming areas that increase contamination in the Malacca River.

Spatial paucity of sampling particularly low-resolution sampling in tributaries can result in a bias for identifying nitrate sources and transformations. In this study, high spatial resolution sampling campaigns covering mainstream and tributaries in combination with hydro-chemical parameters and dual isotopes of nitrate were performed to reveal spatio-temporal variations of nitrate sources and transformations in a river draining a mixed LULC catchment. This study suggested that point sources dominated the nitrate in the summer and winter, while non-point sources dominated the nitrate in the spring and autumn. A positive correlation was observed between proportions from sewage and land use index (LUI). However, negative correlations between soil nitrogen/nitrogen fertilizer and LUI were observed. With an increase of urban areas, the increased contribution from domestic sewage resulted in an increase of NO3- concentrations in rivers. Both urban and agricultural inputs should be considered in nitrate pollution management in a mixed LULC catchment. We concluded that the seasonal variations of nitrate sources were mainly affected by flow velocity conditions and agricultural activities, while spatial variations were mainly affected by LULC. In addition, we found a novel underestimation of dominated sources from Bayesian model because of mixing effect of isotope values from the tributaries to mainstream, however, high spatial resolution sampling can make up for this shortcoming. delta N-15 and delta O-18 values of nitrate indicated that nitrate originated from nitrification in soils. The nitrate concentrations and correlation between delta N-15 and 1/[NO3-] suggested little contribution of nitrate removal by denitrification. Thus, the nitrate reduction in the Yuehe River basin needs to be strengthened.

In this research two SAR images ALOS PALSAR and RADARSAT-1 were fused with SPOT data. Although, both SAR data were gathered in same polarization, and had same ground resolution, they differ in wavelengths. As different data fusion methods, intensity hue saturation (IHS), principal component analysis, discrete wavelet transformation, high pass frequency (HPF), and Ehlers, were performed and compared. For the quality analyses, visual interpretation was applied as a qualitative analysis, and spectral quality metrics of the fused images, such as correlation coefficient (CC) and universal image quality index (UIQI) were applied as a quantitative analysis. Furthermore, multispectral SPOT image and SAR fused images were classified with Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) method for the evaluation of their efficiencies. Ehlers gave the best score in the quality analysis and for the accuracy of LULC on LULC mapping of PALSAR and RADARSAT images. The results showed that the HPF method is in the second place with an increased thematic mapping accuracy. IHS had the worse results in all analyses.

Results revealed that there has been a change in AABR land use pattern from 2008 to 2018. The major changes include loss of 19.72 km(2) of vegetation cover in various forest types due to increasing biotic interference and over grazing, conversion of 14.77 km(2) of Dense Sal mixed forest to open mixed forest and cultivable land, and 5.0 km(2) teak plantation and Bamboo brakes to agricultural land. Despite losing many plant species due to anthropogenic pressure, the present study found that the AABR as a unique repository of plant species rich in biodiversity. Many spots of this area are invaded or replaced by exotic species which is causing the loss of ecology and diversity of this region.

In this study, using an Atmospheric General Circulation Model (AGCM) coupled with a land surface model, biophysical impacts of LULCC on global and regional climate are investigated by using a LULCC map which covers 63 years from 1948 to 2010 with interannual variation. A methodology has been developed to convert a recently developed LULCC fraction map with 1 degrees x 1 degrees resolution to the AGCM grid points in which only one dominant type is allowed. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted to ensure consistency of the trend of the original LULCC fraction change and the trend of the fraction of grid point changes over different regions. The model was integrated with a potential vegetation map (CTL) and the map with LULCC, in which a set of surface parameters such as leaf area index, albedo and other soil and vegetation parameters were accordingly changed with interannual variation. The results indicate that the interannual LULCC map simulation is able to reproduce better interannual variability of surface temperature and rainfall when compared to the control simulation. LULCC causes negative effect on global precipitation, with the strongest significant signals over degraded regions such as East Asia, West Africa and South America, and some of these changes are consistent with observed regional anomalies for certain time periods. LULCC causes reduction in net radiation and evapotranspiration which leads to changes in monsoon circulation and variation in magnitude and pattern of moisture flux convergence and subsequent reduction in precipitation. Meanwhile, LULCC enhances surface warming during the summer in the LULCC regions due to greatly reduced evapotranspiration. In contradiction to the surface, upper troposphere temperatures are cool because of less latent heat released into the upper troposphere, which leads to weaker circulation in LULCC regions.",land use land cover change,land-atmosphere interactions,monsoon,precipitation reduction,surface energy balance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, anthropogenic deforestation in preindustrial Eurasia may have led to feedbacks to the climate system: both biogeophysical, regionally amplifying winter cold and summer warm temperatures, and biogeochemical, stabilizing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and thus influencing global climate. Quantification of these effects is difficult, however, because scenarios of anthropogenic land cover change over the Holocene vary widely, with increasing disagreement back in time. Because land cover change had such widespread ramifications for the Earth system, it is essential to assess current ALCC scenarios in light of observations and provide guidance on which models are most realistic. Here, we perform a systematic evaluation of two widely-used ALCC scenarios (KK10 and HYDE3.1) in northern and part of central Europe using an independent, pollen-based reconstruction of Holocene land cover (REVEALS). Considering that ALCC in Europe primarily resulted in deforestation, we comparemodeled land use with the cover of non-forest vegetation inferred from the pollen data. Though neither land cover change scenario matches the pollen-based reconstructions precisely, KK10 correlates well with REVEALS at the country scale, while HYDE systematically underestimates land use with increasing magnitude with time in the past.

In this article, based on GIS technologies, an analysis of the state of land use and its changes in the territory of the Zhytomyr Region, as well as the impact of Russian aggression against Ukraine on these processes, was carried out. The structure and the dynamics of the main classes of the land cover of the region for the past 7 years were analyzed, the main causes and consequences of such trends were determined, and the analysis of changes in the land cover was carried out. According to the results of this study, in 2022, 52 % of the territory of the Zhytomyr Region was under forested areas, which consist of two categories: forests and other forested areas. The first category remained unchanged during the studied period since the government system of protection and reproduction of forest resources functions effectively. While the second category significantly decreased due to the fact that firewood is the most available fuel resource for heating buildings, so the population began to harvest wood in the form of felling and clearing old gardens, forested bushes and rivers (irrigation canals), and forest strips. Agriculture of the Zhytomyr Region develops due to extensification. According to Google Dynamic World data, in 2022, 34 % of the territory of the Zhytomyr Region is systematically used for growing agricultural crops. Over the past seven years, there has been a significant increase in cultivated land by 27 %.

A decrease was observed for all types of territorial communities until 2021 (10 % annually on average), while, in 2022, the decline slowed down significantly in rural and village territorial communities and stopped in urban ones. This dynamic is connected with two factors: 1) part of the gardens of rural households were sown with grass due to the fact that men were mobilized to the Armed Forces of Ukraine as a result of Russian aggression, and growing grass requires less human costs; 2) Russian aggression caused a shortage of certain food products, and their significant increase in price while keeping cattle provides food for the rural household, so, in 2022, most of the offspring from cattle were not sold and left for further maintenance.

Similarly, the ANN model's validation using Mean Square Error (0.523 and 0.796 for summer) and Correlation coefficient (0.6023 and 0.831 for winter) values demonstrated a good prediction accuracy. The LULC prediction result indicated that the built-up area will be expanded by 58.03 km(2) and 79.90 km(2), respectively, from 2019 to 2029 and 2039. The predicted seasonal LST indicated that in 2029 and 2039, more than 23.30 % and 50.46 % of the summer and 3.02 % and 13.02 % of the winter seasons will likely be experienced LSTs greater than 35 degrees C. The results of public participation exposed that changes in LULC classes, variations in LST, and climate change significantly impact the regional biodiversity (loss of farmland and water bodies), reduce agricultural productivity, and increase extreme weather events (flood, heavy rainfall, and cold/warm temperature).

This paper presents a set of 25 scenarios comprising information on quantitative land use changes in Europe. The scenarios have been selected from studies with different foci, operating on both different spatial scales and different time horizons. Given the diversity of quantitative scenarios this review illustrates the scenario design and its quantification, and evaluates the results of land use/cover changes on a European level. Major gaps of current scenario exercises and suggestions for improvement are topics of the discussion section (Section 4).The focus of this review is on the comparison of selected driving forces and on agricultural land use/cover change in ""Western Europe"" (i.e. EU-15 plus Switzerland and Norway for some studies). Results show large differences in future land use/cover changes ranging from moderate decreases (15%) to large increases (30%) depending on the assumptions about global trade. increase in agricultural productivity and biofuel production. Domestic demand is a minor factor of land use/cover change since population is only changing slightly, and the consumption level is stable and decoupled from economic growth. Scenarios show that the rate and direction of land cover change differ over time. Considerable shifts towards grassland abandonment in many scenarios reflect the changes in agricultural management. Increasing biofuel production as a result of both increasing energy demand and pro-active climate policies takes up considerable areas in many scenarios and prevents substantial abandonment of agricultural land.Although comparable quantitative results concerning European agricultural land use/cover change are only available on a very aggregated level, the results are important to be dealt with when discussing future challenges of rural areas.

Especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, where more than two-thirds of the population rely on forest and woodland resources for their livelihoods, deforestation and land use changes for crop production lead to a substantial loss of ecosystem-level carbon stock. Unfortunately, the impacts of deforestation and land use change can be more critical than in any other region, but these are poorly quantified. We analyse changes in the main carbon pools (above- and below-ground, soil and litter, respectively) after deforestation and land use/land cover change, for the Jomoro District (Ghana), by assessing the initial reference level of carbon stock for primary forest and the subsequent stock changes and dynamics as a consequence of conversion to the secondary forest and to five different tree plantations (rubber, coconut, cocoa, oil palm, and mixed plantations) on a total of 72 plots. Results indicate overall a statistically significant carbon loss across all the land uses/covers and for all the carbon pools compared to the primary forest with the total carbon stock loss ranging between 35% and 85% but with no statistically significant differences observed in the comparison between primary forest and mixed plantations and secondary forest. Results also suggest that aboveground carbon and soil organic carbon are the primary pools contributing to the total carbon stocks but with opposite trends of carbon loss and accumulation.

The economically developed regions presented a more obvious loss of carbon. The region with small LULC changes had a lower carbon loss. The land transfer of cultivated land to built-up land is the main transfer type causing the carbon storage loss.

Results showed that the prediction accuracy of LST was maximized when landscape, topographic, and LULC features within a 150 m buffer radius were adopted as independent variables. Specifically, the existence of surrounding built-up and vegetation areas were found to be the most influencing factors in explaining LST. In this study, after the LULC changes from expressway to green areas, approximately 1.5 degrees C of decreasing LST was predicted. The findings of our study can be utilized for assessing and monitoring the thermal environmental impact of urban planning and projects.

Model validation compared the simulated and observed LULCs of 2015 and showed a high level of agreement with Kappa variation estimates of K-no (0.82), K-loc (0.82) and K-standard (0.76). Simulation results indicated a projected increase of 26.09%, 65.65% and 55.78% in cropland, built-up and bare land categories between 2015 and 2035, respectively.

In addition, this may lead to water quality and quantity (both surface and groundwater) deterioration in the catchment. Moreover, water body reductions may contribute to water shortages and exacerbate droughts in an already water-stressed catchment. The loss of vegetal cover and an increase in built-up areas may result in increased runoff incidents, leading to flash floods.

Much of what is known about urban areas and the carbon cycle is limited to aggregate levels of activities within urban areas, usually by sector, with little focus on how the spatial configuration of urban land systems affects carbon-emitting activities. Given that urban areas produce about 70% of global energy-related CO2 emissions, it is crucial to understand the relationship between urban environments, the activities they influence, and the resulting carbon emissions. This paper summarizes the current state of knowledge of how urban land systems affect carbon emissions and vulnerability, and identifies research gaps and opportunities for urban land science to contribute to climate change science, particularly through land architecture.

This paper discusses the ability of the integration of cellular automata (CA) and Markov chain-based 2D land use simulation module conjunction with GIS techniques. Markov chain algorithm is used for calibration and optimization by considering LULC of appropriate set of images for the years 2004, 2006, and 2018. Transitional change in LULC from one class to another is simulated using an artificial neural network (ANN) while cellular automata simulation is carried out to predict the plausible future LULC for the year 2052 after validating the model using the LULC of the year 2018. Analysis of the multi-temporal LULC maps indicated that the biophysical and socio-economic factors have greatly influenced the rise in built up while a decrease in agriculture in the year 2052. In conclusion, this technique is a powerful tool for monitoring and modeling change in land cover.

By analysing remotely sensed images and review of relevant literature, the dynamics of change in the urban green-grey landscape were examined. While the grey (impermeable) space has increased from 23.3% to 77.6% between 1986 and 2016, green (permeable) space has declined from 76.7% to 24.4% within the same period. Rapidly growing and sprawling city, operating within a weak institutional framework, underlies the changes in land use/land cover in the Metropolis. This trend poses potential socio-environmental threat to the immediate city environment and even beyond. We recommend prioritising greening of the city by Kumasi Metropolitan Authority with the involvement and support of all stakeholders.

Various sequential preprocessing steps such as atmospheric correction, image enhancement, mosaicking, masking, and clipping were performed using QGIS 3.16 and ArcGIS 10.8 software. The land use and land cover classes found in the study area were water, vegetation, bare land, agriculture, and built-up, and classification was executed by using the Random Forest machine learning algorithm. The accuracy of the classified land use and land cover was validated and accepted with Kappa agreements of 0.89, 0.85, and 0.88 for the years 1991, 2005, and 2020, respectively. Throughout the study period, agriculture emerged as the dominant land use class, followed by vegetation and bare land. The area under the land use and land cover categories of water, vegetation, and bare land continuously decreased between the years 1991-2005 and 2005-2020, while agriculture and built-up areas recorded an increase of 4.49%, 0.76%, 17.81%, and 2.04%, respectively. To project future land use and land cover status, the popular Cellular Automata Markov Chain Model was employed. The projected results indicate that agriculture will remain the dominant land cover with a share of 70.24%, followed by vegetation at 17.72% and built-up areas at 5.09%.

Objective was to evaluate hydro-ecological balance inside campus by determining spatio-temporal disparity between hydrological parameters (rainfall-runoff processes), ecological components (forest, vegetation, lake, barren land), and anthropogenic stressors (urbanization and encroachments). High-resolution satellite imageries were generated for the campus using Goog le Earth Pro, by manual supervised classification method. Rainfall patterns were studied using secondary data sources, and surface runoff was estimated using SCS-CN method. Additionally, reconnaissance surveys, ground-truthing, and qualitative investigations were conducted to validate LULC changes and hydro-ecological stability. LULC of 2018 showed forest, having an area cover of 52%, as the most dominating land use followed by built-up (43%). Results indicated that the area under built-up increased by 40% and playground by 7%. Despite rapid construction activities, forest cover and Powai lake remained unaffected. This anomaly was attributed to the drastically declining barren land area (up to similar to 98%) encompassing additional construction activities. Sustainability of the campus was demonstrated with appropriate measures undertaken to mitigate negative consequences of unwarranted floods owing to the rise of 6% in the forest cover and a decline of 21% in water hyacinth cover over Powai lake. Due to this, surface runoff (similar to 61% of the rainfall) was observed approximately consistent and being managed appropriately despite major alterations in the LULC.

We developed an effectiveness index including NPA percentage of transformed areas (agriculture, induced vegetation, forestry plantations, and human settlements) in 2002, the rate and absolute extent of change in these areas (1993-2002), the comparison between rates of change observed inside the NPA and in an equivalent surrounding area, and between the NPA and the state(s) in which it is located. We chose 69 terrestrial federal NPAs, decreed before 1997, that were larger than 1,000 ha, not urban/reforested with non-native vegetation, not islands and not coastal strips, and estimated the extent of transformed areas using 1993 and 2002 land use/land cover maps. Over 54% of NPAs were effective, and were heterogeneously distributed by management categories: 65% of Biosphere Reserves, 53% of Flora and Fauna Protection Areas, and 45% of National Parks. 23% of NPAs were regarded as weakly effective, and the remaining 23% as non-effective. We recognize the importance of NPAs as a relevant conservation instrument, as half of NPAs analyzed (particularly biosphere reserves) prevented natural vegetation loss compared with their geographic context. Our results suggest that conservation based on NPAs in Mexico still faces significant challenges.

The methodology is illustrated by comparing the Global Land Cover 2000 data set and the MODIS global land cover product. Overall accuracy measures are calculated, and the spatial fuzzy agreement between the two land cover products is provided.

However, researches focusing on the long-term uninterrupted land use and land cover change (LULCC) impacted on landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) in rapid urban expansion areas remains limited, let alone different temporal scenarios adjacency thresholds. This work aims to refine the temporal LSM considering spatiotemporal land use and land cover (LULC) and to provide decision makers with governing factors in landslides control during urbanization in mountainous areas. Herein, annual LULC data and landslide inventory spanning from 1992 to 2022 were utilized to map dynamic landslide susceptibility in Wanzhou District of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, China. Initially, the landslide-related factors were filtered as input features of random forest (RF) model before diagnosis via multicollinearity test and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC). The advanced patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model was then invited to fuel temporal susceptibility prediction powered by LULCC projections. Finally, the performance of various scenarios was evaluated using Receiver Characteristic Curve (ROC) curves and Shapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) technique, with discussions on LULCC temporal adjacency thresholds and mutual feedback mechanism between territorial exploitation and landslide occurrences. The results indicate that the precision of LSM is positively correlated with the time horizon, acted by incorporating the latest LULC and LULCC achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.920. The transition of land from forest to cropland and impervious areas should be avoided to minimize the increase in landslide susceptibility. Moreover, a one-year adjacency threshold of LULCC is recommended for optimal model accuracy in future LSM. This dynamic LSM framework can serve as a reference for decision makers in future landslide susceptibility mitigation and land resources utilization in rapid urban expansion areas worldwide.",Landslide,Susceptibility,Land use and land cover change,Random forest,PLUS model,,,"Gong, Shunqi","Zheng, Guyue","Yang, Jing","Zhan, Weiwei",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deforestation or human land use activity related to water and development has expanded the ideal habitats for malaria-carrying mosquitoes, resulting in an upsurge of malaria transmission.The presence of these habitats and breeding increased the contact between humans and mosquitoes, thus increasing the number of malaria cases. The decrease of canopy and forest cover has increased the temperature, resulting in the shortening of aquatic stages and sporogony development of the mosquitoes. This study aims to provide an understanding of the relationship between the topography effect over the land-use factor and land cover change on malaria for more than ten years from 2005 to 2019 of transmission.METHODS: Malaria case data obtained were analyzed for the trends, incidence rate, and spatial distribution. Remote Sensing and geographic information system were used to determine the land use and land cover change in selected districts of North Borneo in Sabah, as the study areas.FINDINGS: The malaria incidence rate shows an increase from 2005 to 2019, with 149.64%. The transmission of the malaria vector dynamics and abundance with topography changes has changed with time, including with forest declination at 8.38%, and cropland change decreased at 16.61%. However, an expansion of 33.6% was observed for oil palm plantations. Overall, the results have shown that the range of incidence rate was found' highly viable from 0.29/1000 persons to 4.09/1000 people.CONCLUSION: In conclusion, using geographic information system remote sensing with malaria integrated topography transmission information will be targeted by zoning most affected areas or the most productive larval habitat for remedial measures. This study can help to reduce the malaria vector population through environmental management related to the mosquito larval cycle in different land-use settings and change by minimizing the transmission by the targeted malaria control program.",Climate change,Geographic information system (GIS),Land use and land cover change,Malaria,Remote sensing,Topography,Transmission risk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forest degradation affects watershed processes and biochemical cycles and leads to soil erosion and water shortage; therefore it is necessary that the spatial dimensions of land use and land cover are identified regularly so that the policy makers and researcher are enabled to make the necessary decisions. Patterns of land use and land cover changes indicate the changes in social and economic conditions. Monitoring such changes is essential for coordinated activities at national and international levels. In recent years, due to easy access to satellite imagery and capabilities of GIS, land use and land cover changes modeling and prediction is very common. To this end, different methods such as statistical techniques like logistic regression, Markov chain analysis and cellular automata have been developed. This study has been done to investigate the land use and land cover changes in Yasouj city area using CA-Markov from 1987 to 2039. Markov chain analysis will describe land use changes from one to another period and use this as a basis to project future changes. This is possible with the development of land use change transition probability matrix from one time to another; which indicates the nature of changes and its application to project changes in the next time period. Results of model and its simulation showed that the area percentage of natural lands (forests and rangelands) in 1987, 1999, 2013 and 2039 was 90, 82, 73 and 59 respectively. The area percentage of man-made lands (farmlands and residential area) in 1987, 1999, 2013 and 2039 was 10, 18, 27 and 41 respectively. Therefore, it can be said that the natural lands in the study area are becoming man-made lands so that in about 40 years (1987-2013), about 30% of the natural lands will decrease. This could have dangerous environmental consequences for the study area. Results of logistic regression with Pseudo R(2)0.3 and ROC about 0.8 represent the relative agreement of the model with actual changes and the appropriate ability of the model for estimating changes in land use and land cover in the last 26 years. Results on simulation of land cover map in 2013 and 2039 showed that CA-Markov has a high ability and capability in land cover changes modeling.

This study explored the future impact of the hydrological responses due to the changing LULC and climate on the Big Creek Lake watershed in Alabama, USA, from 2021 to 2050 using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Five climate model datasets were used under the moderate scenario (Representative Concentrative Pathways 4.5) and the extreme scenario (Representative Concentrative Pathways 8.5), and the datasets were downscaled and bias-corrected. In addition, changing the LULC of five categories was predicted by Cellular Automata Markov (CA- Markov). With these data combined with the elevation (Digital Elevation Model), soils, and weather data, the SWAT model was calibrated and validated for the studied watershed to quantify how climate change will affect streamflow, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Our results indicate streamflow will increase due to the 50-acre increase in urban LULC. As streamflow increases, the percolation, surface runoff, lateral flow, groundwater flow, and water yield will also increase because the streamflow impacts these hydrological components. Moreover, the increase rate in streamflow is the same for all the components for January, February, and March. Therefore, there is a strong correlation between these months. On the contrary, evaporation will be high in May, June, and July because of the increasing temperature and streamflow. However, the changes in the water hydrological parameters and total nitrogen and phosphorus will be more intense in RCP8.5 than in RCP4.5.",Climate change,Land use land cover,Soil and water assessment tool,Representative concentration path,Cellular automata-markov,,,"Ahsanullah, S.

While forest cover change dynamics have been widely documented in various ecological systems, how these changes affect ecosystem service values has received limited attention. In this study we assessed the impact of land-use/land-cover dynamics on ecosystem service values in dry Afromontane forest in Northern Ethiopia. We estimated ecosystem service values and their changes based on the benefit transfer method using land cover data of the years 1985, 2000, and 2016 with their corresponding locally valid value coefficients and from the Ecosystem service valuation database. The total ecosystem service values of the whole study area were about USD 16.6, 19.0, and 18.1 million in 1985, 2000, and 2016, respectively. The analyses indicated an increase in ecosystem service values from 1985 to 2000 and a decrease in ecosystem service values from 2000 to 2016. Similarly, the contribution of specific ecosystem services increased in the first study period and decreased in the second study period. The findings highlight how forest cover dynamics can be translated into changes in ecosystem service values in dry Afromontane forest ecosystems in Northern Ethiopia and showed how specific ecosystem services contributed to the observed trends. The findings also illustrated the temporal heterogeneity in the impacts of land-use/land-cover dynamics on values of ecosystem services. The findings can serve as crucial inputs for policy and strategy formulations for the sustainable use and management of forest resources and can also guide the allocation of limited resources among competing demands to safeguard the ecosystems that offer the best-valued services.",forest ecosystems,ecosystem service values,land-use,land-cover change,Afromontane forest,ecosystem services,Ethiopia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Variable LULC classifications considered included: built-up areas, open spaces/bare lands, vegetations, waterbodies and wetlands. In three decades (1992-2022), increases in the built-up, open space/bare land and wetland LULC were observed and attributed to population increases and higher infrastructural demands whereas evident reductions in the sizes of vegetation and waterbody categories were ascribed to anthropogenic activities and climate events. The average annual rates of change in the built-up and vegetation LULC increased (7.28%) and decreased (-3.02%), respectively, between 1992 and 2022; with the built-up area experiencing a 218% increase from 6493 to 20,672 (km2) whereas vegetation decreased by 90% from 23,445 to 2239 (km2). The corollary is that urban growth, exemplified by the built-up LULC, was progressive while vegetation cover was depleted, in the 30-year period. Changes in five other periods were also interrogated. Government and stakeholders-promoted afforestation and agroforestry programs are recommended as plausible solutions to check vegetation-cover depletion.

The infrastructure required for agricultural development has cumulative and indirect effects, which alter native plant communities, in parallel with the direct effects of land use conversion to irrigated crops. Our study quantified historical land cover change over a 150-year period for the Walker River Basin of Nevada and California by comparing direct and indirect impacts of irrigated agriculture at the scale of a 10,217 km(2) watershed. We used General Land Office survey notes to reconstruct land cover at the time of settlement (1860-1910) and compared the settlement-era distribution of land cover to the current distribution. Direct conversion of natural vegetation to agricultural land uses accounted for 59 percent of total land cover change. Changes among nonagricultural vegetation included shifts from more mesic types to more xeric types and shifts from herbaceous wet meadow vegetation to woody phreatophytes, suggesting a progressive xerification. The area of meadow and wetland has experienced the most dramatic decline, with a loss of 95 percent of its former area. Our results also show Fremont cottonwood, a key riparian tree species in this region, is an order of magnitude more widely distributed within the watershed today than at the time of settlement.

Thus, the purpose of this research is to investigate the effect of Land Use Land Cover (LULC) change on Land Surface Temperature (LST) and then study UHI in Sharqiyah from 2001 to 2022 using remote sensing data. This data was collected from the Landsat satellite and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 11A Thermal sensors. A Mono-Window Algorithm was used on Landsat 8 and 9 data to estimate the LST. To determine the LST and UHI, the thermal band was utilized. LULC maps were created using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification technique. To evaluate various LULC indices in the Sharqiyah and find their correlation with LST, the spectral indices Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Bare Land Index (NDBaI), and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) were obtained from the processing of multispectral Landsat data. To check data sources, air temperature measurements for Sharqiyah were also acquired. The results show that urban expansion has increased in a noticeable trend. The built-up area increased by 18.9% during the research phase, and the region's mean LST increased within 3.98 degrees C. The UHI threshold temperature increased by 4.27 degrees C.

Such land use conversions would further fragment forests, reduce opportunities for storage of carbon in forest, and also impact provision of other goods and services. The U.S. population is projected to grow by more than another 120 million people by 2050, with relatively fast growth rates in the key timber supply regions of the South and Pacific Northwest. In addition to a reduction of four percent in U.S. private timberland, forest cover dynamics are projected to significantly change the composition of forests, especially in the eastern U.S. The largest forest cover changes result from intensification of forestry practices in the southern U.S., where the area of pine plantations is projected to increase by more than 50% over the next fifty years. Although areas of softwoods are projected to increase across many regions of the country, especially on forest industry lands, hardwoods will remain the dominant forest type on private lands. Projected area changes for forest cover types differ notably by region. Land use and land cover dynamics will directly or indirectly contribute to sustainability of forest resources. In addition to changes in the biologic composition of forests, changing landowner demographics including increasing numbers of owners and changing management objectives will also impact the forests.",land-use changes,forest-cover changes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY OF AMERICAN FORESTERS, 2001 NATIONAL CONVENTION",,,,,,,,,,,,

The objectives of this study are to quantify land use change over the 25-year period 1990-2015 and analyze temporal and spatial urbanization trends in the Middle Rio Grande Basin. We conclude by indicating how the results can inform on-going water resource research and public policy discussion in an arid region. Results show that the predominant upland mixed vegetation land cover category has been steadily declining, giving up land to urban and agricultural development. Urban development across the region of interest increased from just under three percent in 1990 to more than 11 percent in 2015, mainly around the major urban areas of El Paso, Ciudad Juarez, and Las Cruces. Public policy aspects related to results from this study include transfer of water rights from agriculture to land developers in cities, higher risk of flooding, loss of natural ecosystems, and increased water pollution from point and non-point sources. Various stakeholders can find the study useful for a better understanding of historical spatial and temporal aspects of urban development and environmental change in arid regions.

Worldwide river basins have observed enormous changes in the land system dynamics as a result of anthropogenic factors such as population, urbanization, development, and agriculture. As is the scenario of various other river basins, the Brahmaputra basin, which falls in China, Bhutan, India, and Bangladesh, is also witnessing the same environmental issues. The present study has been conducted on the Brahmaputra Valley in Assam, India (a sub-basin of the larger Brahmaputra basin) and assessed its LULC changes using a maximum likelihood classification algorithm. The study also simulated the changing LULC pattern for the years 2030, 2040, and 2050 using the GIS-based cellular automata Markov model (CA-Markov) to understand the implications of the ongoing trends in the LULC change for future land system dynamics. The current rate of change of the LULC in the region was assessed using the 48 years of earth observation satellite data from 1973 to 2021. It was observed that from 1973 to 2021, the area under vegetation cover and water body decreased by 19.48 and 47.13%, respectively. In contrast, cultivated land, barren land, and built-up area increased by 7.60, 20.28, and 384.99%, respectively. It was found that the area covered by vegetation and water body has largely been transitioned to cultivated land and built-up classes. The research predicted that, by the end of 2050, the area covered by vegetation, cultivated land, and water would remain at 39.75, 32.31, and 4.91%, respectively, while the area covered by built-up areas will increase by up to 18.09%. Using the kappa index (ki) as an accuracy indicator of the simulated future LULCs, the predicted LULC of 2021 was validated against the observed LULC of 2021, and the very high ki observed validated the generated simulation LULC products. The research concludes that significant LULC changes are taking place in the study area with a decrease in vegetation cover and water body and an increase of area under built-up. Such trends will continue in the future and shall have disastrous environmental consequences unless necessary land resource management strategies are not implemented. The main factors responsible for the changing dynamics of LULC in the study area are urbanization, population growth, climate change, river bank erosion and sedimentation, and intensive agriculture. This study is aimed at providing the policy and decision-makers of the region with the necessary what-if scenarios for better decision-making.

Within this context, synthetic aperture radar images have been used by many international institutions and, much less frequently, by national ones, usually applying a single polarization, which generates greater dedication in field and post-editing work. . It is precisely the current possibility of being able to work with four polarizations that directed the work team to carry out an analysis of this type of images, adopting one of the most widely used classification systems in the country, the Corine Land Cover.

The study discusses the relationships between five major land cover types and aerosol optical depth (AOD) within a city combining the high-resolution satellite-derived AOD products (derived from Sentinel-2) and land cover products (60 m and 100 m, respectively) for Beijing and its surroundings from 2017 to 2019. Contribution analysis is performed to quantitatively evaluate the influences of land cover on regional AOD over the study area. Patterns of aerosol distribution remarkably vary in time and space. Statistics of seasonal average AOD peak in spring and then progressively decline from summer through autumn to winter. High AOD values coincide with a low normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and a high normalized difference built-up index (NDBI). Urban and built-up land is a major contributor to regional AOD in the study area, especially in spring; forest and grassland always reduce AOD. Anthropogenic activities have a non-negligible influence on AOD and can even reverse the contribution of a land cover type to aerosols.

This has resulted in large-scale transformation of the LULC pattern in the region. Thus, this study is intended to analyze and quantify the LULC change and its drivers in the peri-urban areas of Delhi NCR using Landsat datasets. Based on an extensive literature survey, several potential drivers of the LULC change have been analyzed using ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographical weighted regression (GWR) for the Delhi NCR. The results from LULC classification showed that the built-up area has increased from 1.67 to 7.12% of the total area of Delhi NCR during 1990-2018 while other LULC types have declined significantly. The OLS results showed that migration and employment in the tertiary sector are the most important drivers of built-up expansion in the study area. The standard residuals and local R-2 results from GWR showed spatial heterogeneity among the coefficients of the explanatory variables throughout the study area.

The urge to monitor Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) and climate changes based on technology and sustainable management are addressed. This study analyzes the historical land cover maps to calculate growth patterns for the years 1985-2022 and uses Logistic Regression (LR) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to project future dynamics forecasts for the years 2030-2040 in the Amman-Zarqa Basin (AZB). The state of the climate and the extreme indices projections of CMIP5 under RCP8.5 are linked to the corrected historical LULC maps and assessed. Given greater dry covering of large surface runoff, little rainfall, and high evapotranspiration rates, the state of the climate across the AZB notably showed instability in key climatic indices and a major exacerbation of warmth and drier soil in the basin. Both climate change and land use are contributing dynamics, but land-use alterations are much more dramatic changes than climate changes. Since the effects of climate alterations are mostly identifiable through land cover forms, land use practices put the phase that may be influenced by climate change. The results revealed that the daily extremes in 1992 are aligned with the corresponding increase of barren lands and diminished the half area of forest, cultivated, rainfed, and pasture lands in 1995. Rainfed regions were converted to agriculture or shrubland with an accuracy of 0.87, and urban encroachment caused the acreage of woodland, cultivated, rainfed, and grazing fields to decrease by almost half. Predicted land cover maps were created using LR in 2030 (Kappa = 0.99) and 2040 (Kappa = 0.90), in contrast to the ANN approach (Kappa = 0.99 for 2030 and 0.90 for 2040). By combining ANN and LR, decreasing bare soil was anticipated between 325 km(2) and 344 km(2). As a result, 20% of the total area of the major AZB cities' urban areas will be doubled.

High-resolution satellite images provide more opportunities for cost-benefit production of such information. This paper proposes a hierarchical LULC classification based on image objects that are created from multiresolution segmentation. A rule-based strategy is used to implement a step-by-step object-based land cover classification on a pan-sharpened IKONOS image taken from a complex urban region in Shiraz, Iran. A new spatial geometrical analysis for the reclassification of unclassified land cover objects is also utilized. After the initial classification, an object-based land use classification is implemented based on the land cover results and using conceptual, spatial, and geometrical modeling of the relationships between land use elements. Overall classification accuracy was 89 and 87% for land cover and land use approaches, respectively. In the best unclassified object analysis, similar to 70% of unclassified objects were reclassified correctly. The hierarchical methodology proposed here results in fewer unclassified objects since a multistage classification process is utilized rather than the traditional one-pass classification.

In past years, land degradation problems related to sheep and horse grazing have gradually come to the fore in public discussion of environmental questions. However, land degradation is often evaluated in different ways by different groups of people. This has led to a lack of consensus regarding rates and severity of land degradation. Therefore, it is important to study differences in environmental perception, and how these differences can be dealt with in the context of sustainable management. This paper aims to highlight farmers' perception of land degradation in Iceland, as perceptions of the environment determine the basis for human activities related to the land. A total of 100 farmers in NE Iceland were questioned and interviewed for their opinions on land degradation, its history, causes and severity. The results indicate that farmers consider land degradation to be a slow process, and not a catastrophic phenomenon. The understanding of the general ecological processes by the users affects their practices and concern for their environment. This feeds back on the land-use system and ultimately causes changes in land-cover. Therefore, if we are to increase our understanding of the processes that lead to land-cover changes we have to integrate the perceptions of land users and technical experts. In this way we may improve conservation practices and land-resource management policies.

Therefore, the main aim of this study was to develop a universal methodology for high-precision land-use analysis in urbanized areas in the context of large-scale mapping. The method uses geoinformation tools, photogrammetric data (orthophoto maps) as well as data acquired during a field inventory (involving a field survey and field mapping). The proposed approach is based on the modified existing approaches towards a detailed identification of land-use patterns while reducing the difficulties arising from the limitations of existing land use data sources. The methodology consists of several steps. First, the data sources for land-use analysis were selected. Subsequently, the classification of land-use categories in urban space was made. Finally, the method to high-precision land-use analysis for large-scale mapping was defined under the assumption that it is to be universal for use in countries with different levels of spatial and economic development. The proposed research method is based on an interpolation algorithm. It is highly valid, flexible, modifiable, accurate, and it can be applied to process publicly available and free sources of spatial data. Validation of the method on a test object (city of Ostroda, Poland) showed its high effectiveness, which is limited only by the type of data.

This region is a clear example of the socioeconomic changes that have been occurring over recent decades in the European Mediterranean as well as their impact on LULC and fire occurrence. Using the LULC changes observed between 1990 and 2006 as a reference, future scenarios were run up to 2025 with the conversion of land use and its effects model. Simultaneously, the relationship between LULC arrangement (interfaces) and historical fire occurrence was calculated using logistic regression analysis and used to quantify changes in future fire occurrence due to projected changes in LULC interfaces. The results revealed that it is possible to explain the probability of fire occurrence using only variables obtained from LULC maps, although the explanatory power of the model is low.

For example, poor LULC practises such as deforestation, livestock overstocking, overgrazing and arable land use intensification on steep slopes disturbs the soil structure leaving the land susceptible to water erosion, a type of physical land degradation. Land degradation related problems exist in Sub-Saharan African countries such as Botswana which is semi-arid in nature. LULC and LD linkage information is still missing in many semi-arid regions worldwide. Mapping seasonal LULC is therefore very important in understanding LULC and LD linkages. This study assesses the impact of seasonal LULC variation on LD utilizing Remote Sensing (RS) techniques for Palapye region in Central District, Botswana. LULC classes for the dry and rainy seasons were classified using LANDSAT 8 images at Level I according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) International Organization of Standardization (ISO) code 19144. Level I consists of 10 LULC classes. The seasonal variations in LULC are further related to LD susceptibility in the semi-arid context. The results suggest that about 985 km(2) (22%) of the study area is susceptible to LD by water, major LULC types affected include: cropland, paved/rocky material, bare land, built-up area, mining area, and water body. Land degradation by water susceptibility due to seasonal land use-land cover variations is highest in the east of the study area where there is high cropland to bare land conversion.",Land Use-Land Cover,Land Degradation,Remote Sensing,LANDSAT,Semi-arid region,Supervised Classification,Maximum Likelihood,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VIII",Land Change Modeler,,,,,,,,,,,

Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) change have been found to affect the transmission of malaria in other regions, but no study has examined such relationships in Nepal. Therefore, this study has three aims: first, to analyze the spatial and temporal trend of Malaria Incidence Rate (MIR) between 1999 and 2015, second to assess LULC change between 2000 and 2010, and finally to understand the relationship between LULC and malaria in Nepal. The land cover types examined are forest, water bodies, agriculture, grassland, shrubland, barren areas, built-up areas, and rice paddies. The temporal trend of MIR and the relationship between MIR and LULC were evaluated using Poisson and negative binomial regression. Forest, water bodies, and built-up area increased in Nepal by 0.8%, 8.2%, and 28.4% respectively, while other LULC variables decreased between 2000 and 2010. MIR decreased significantly in 21 districts; however, four districts, namely Pyuthan, Kaski, Rupandehi, and Siraha, had a significantly increasing MIR trend between 1999 and 2015. MIR was positively related to water bodies and rice paddies during 2001, 2002, and 2003 but negatively related to grassland during 2010. However, there was no relationship between LULC and MIR during 2000, 2011, 2012 and 2013.

Normalized difference of water index technique was used for identification of land and water boundary. The maximum likelihood supervised image classification was applied to detect the land-use/land-cover type and identify erosional impact with best accuracy. Results of long-term river channel migration showed that the land area is influencing with river erosion, settlement area is increasing, vegetation area is decreasing, but sand bar, water body and cultivated land area are oscillating.

Between 1996 and 2005 the number of quarries increased from 711 to 1,278 with a simultaneous increase of quarried land from 2,875 to 5,283 ha. Remote sensing data from 2005 showed that 21.5% of quarries were distributed on forest-land/arable land while 32.4% of quarries were detected on scrubland-grassland. Due to institutional weakness and the absence of a national policy, most Lebanese quarries have not been exploited following environmental concepts. To facilitate decision-making on rehabilitation options we propose two geospatial models based on bio and geophysical variables like precipitation, slope gradient, slope aspect, the availability of soil material, rock infiltration and soil texture to assess the probability of reclamation success. All attributes in the vegetation recovery model were assigned a weighted numeric score and separated into four classes of likely re vegetation success. In addition to the above-mentioned parameters, water-harvesting potential was assessed based on catchment area above the quarry and rock permeability within the quarry. Therefore, deserted quarries were assessed for potential vegetation establishment and/or water harvesting. Results showed that potential re-vegetation success is strongly linked to terrain geomorphology and climatic conditions. Quarries suitable for water harvesting were spread all over the territory and can present useful additional water resources on the dry eastern mountain chain characterized with water scarcity. The good separation of the two sets of quarries suitable either for re-vegetation or water harvesting suggests the workability of the models, which need further field testing. But, limited national resources available for reclamation will be better targeted toward assessing those quarries where the likelihood of successful reclamation is most probable. The results of these models could be used to support decision-making concerning rehabilitation strategies towards restoration or possible alternative post-reclamation land uses.",Land degradation,Land cover change,GIS model,Quarries,Restoration,Water harvesting,,"Jomaa, I.","Miller, D.","Sloan, J.","Shaban, A.","Hamze, M.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"LAND DEGRADATION AND DESERTIFICATION: ASSESSMENT, MITIGATION AND REMEDIATION",,,,,,,,,,,,

These data sets have then been used for the analyses of land use/cover changes, model simulations and checking of the models. This paper outlines how the data sets have been used and what has been found regarding the land use/cover changes in Japan over the last hundred years, and presents the frameworks and results of empirical models of the changes.Two similar, but different, approaches have been taken in order to obtain a likely land use pattern for the 2020s. The first is based on a simple but realistic assumption that the '2 km grid squares' where 'settlement' is the second largest type of land use will be predominated by 'settlement' in about 35 years. This assumption has been justified by comparison of the data for c. 1950 and 1985. In fact, the validity of the model has been tested, and proved to be highly relevant. Another model assumes that settlement expansion occurs so as to ease high population density in settlements, and that it affects other types of land use. A general land use map for the 2020s has been produced based on these and other assumptions. The distribution of urbanized areas resembles that obtained by the first model. It is noted that paddy-field is the largest type of land use that suffers from urban expansion in the coming two to three decades in central Japan.

Mapping land cover is a fundamental task in the geographic sciences and is typically done using remote sensing (overhead) imagery through manual annotation. We here propose a novel alternate approach based on proximate sensing. The goal of proximate sensing is to map what-is-where on the surface of the Earth using ground level images of objects and scenes. It has the potential to map phenomena not observable through remote sensing. We perform an extensive case study on using ground level images for binary land cover classification into developed and undeveloped regions. We investigate visual features and text annotations to label images or sets of images with these two classes. Knowing the location of the images allows us to generate land cover maps which we quantitatively evaluate using ground truth maps. We apply our approach to two photo collections, Flickr, the popular photo sharing website, and the Geograph project, whose goal is to collect geographically informative photos. Comparing these two collections allows us to measure the impact of photographer intent. We utilize a weakly supervised learning framework which eliminates the need for manually labeled training data. We also investigate methods for filtering images that are unlikely to be geographically informative. Our results are promising and validate proximate sensing as a novel alternate approach to geographic discovery.",Proximate sensing,Land cover classification,Geo-referenced photos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we evaluated the effectiveness of 18 NPA located within the Transmexican Volcanic Belt by analyzing deforestation and land use and land cover change (LULCC) between 2002 and 2014. An index of effectiveness (EI) was obtained by adding three parameters: (1) the percentage of the transformed area (TA%), (2) the rate of change inside the NPA (LULCC-R), and (3) the difference between the rate of change inside the NPA and outside (buffer). The sum of the three standardized parameters forms the EI, where NPA were classified as effective (index value > 2), weakly effective (index value between 1 and 2), and noneffective (index value < 1). In addition, we identified the most important transitions between categories of LULCC for each NPA. Only three NPA were classified as effective: Cienegas de Lerma (EI = 2.29), Volcan Nevado de Colima (EI = 2.08), and Iztaccihuatl-Popocatepetl (EI = 2.06). Eleven were weakly effective, and the remaining four were noneffective. Bosencheve was the least effective (with all parameters in 0). In terms of transition probabilities in each effectiveness class, effective NPA were characterized by transition probabilities of forest cover recovery. Weakly effective NPA presented exchange probabilities between forest cover and land use. Finally, in noneffective NPA, probabilities indicated transitions from forest cover to agricultural and livestock land use.

A large number of land-cover datasets are currently used in climate models either to better represent surface conditions or to study the impacts of surface changes. Deciding upon land-cover datasets can be challenging because the datasets are made with different sensors, ranging methodologies, and varying classification objectives. A new statistical measure Q was developed to evaluate land-cover datasets in land-climate interaction research. This measure calculates biophysical precision of land-cover datasets using 1-km monthly Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) leaf area index (LAI) product. This method aggregates within-class biophysical years into a single statistic. A smaller mean Q value for a land-cover product indicates more precise biophysical characterization within the classes. As an illustration, four land-cover products were assessed in the East Africa region: Global Land Cover 2000 (GLC2000), MODIS land cover, Olson Global Ecosystems (OGE), and Land Ecosystem-Atmosphere Feedback (LEAF) model. The evaluation was conducted at three different spatial scales corresponding to 30 x 30, 50 x 50, and 100 x 100 km quadrates. The Q measure found that GLC2000 ranked higher compared to the other three land-cover products for every quadrate size. For the 30 x 30 km quadrate size GLC2000 was significantly better than LEAF, which is currently used in the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System. The statistic ranks MODIS land cover above OGE, which is above LEAF. As quadrate size increases, differences between Q decrease indicating greater uncertainty at coarser resolution. The utility of the measure is that it can be applied to any continuous parameter over any scale (space or time) to evaluate the biophysical precision of any land-cover dataset.",Land-cover product,Climate modeling,Leaf area index,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study creates a novel LULC classification scheme by incorporating ecological data to redefine classes of an existing LULC classification based on variation in above-ground tree carbon. A tree inventory was conducted for 531 plots within a subbasin of the Tampa Bay Watershed, Florida, USA. Above-ground tree carbon was estimated using the i-Tree model. Plots were classified using the Florida Land Use Cover Classification System. Mean quantities of above-ground tree carbon, by class, were tested for statistical differences. A reclassification was conducted based on these differences. Sub-classes within a given ""land cover"" class were similar for six of the seven classes. Significant differences were found within the ""Wetlands"" class based on vegetation cover, forming two distinct groups: ""Forested Wetlands"" and ""Non-forested and Mangrove Wetlands"". The urban ""land use"" class showed differences between ""Residential"" and ""Non-residential"" sub-classes, forming two new classes.

Understanding the impacts of LULC changes on water resources is therefore an important research issue for watershed management. Therefore, this paper discusses the impacts of LULC changes on surface runoff and sediment yield of Upper Tapi River Sub-basin, India using Soil and water assessment Tool (SWAT). The land use dynamics of the sub-basin was assessed through the analysis of four land use maps corresponding to year 1975, 1990, 2000, and 2016. It is found that from the year 1975-2016 agricultural area is increased by 18% whereas forest land and rangeland are decreased by 7% and 10% respectively. This land use change may lead to land degradation and ecological damages in the study area. These LULC maps were used to calibrate four separate SWAT models with the corresponding climate data from 1979 to 2013. These models performance are evaluated based on R-2, ENS and PBIAS values which indicate very good agreement between observed and simulated discharge. The impacts of LULC changes were assessed by four different scenarios in which climate data (1979-2013), Soil map and slope map were kept same, and only the land use maps were changed. The results of this study showed that LULC changes have resulted in corresponding increase in surface runoff, water yield, and sediment yield. The surface runoff has increased about 36% and water yield has increased about 22%. Similarly, sediment yield is also increased around 22% from the scenario S-1 to S-4.

Industrialization accelerates urbanization, resulting in land transformations, which are one of the major uses of natural resources. In a fast-growing city like Delhi, the development has been rapid, and it is important to investigate the factors behind these shifts. For the present study, remote sensing and GIS models are used for land use and land cover (LULC) change detection. The applied model in the study uses the satellite datasets of two different satellites, i.e., Landsat 5 (TM) of 2010 and Landsat 8 (OLI) of 2021, from November with little or no cloud cover, which could block the LULC features. The study compares the temporal LULC map and analyzes the change and increase in urbanization for two periods, 2010 and 2021.

Bangladesh has been experiencing significant changes in landscape settings, facilitating changes in people's livelihoods. To understand the changing pattern of livelihood in coastal areas of Bangladesh, it is crucial to detect the LULC changes, including the influence of related drivers. Following the background, this study was conducted in Batiaghata Upazila of Khulna district to assess the LULC changes using RS and GIS techniques over 30 years (1990-2019). With the help of 15 key informant interviews and 2 focus group discussions, this study delves into the driving forces behind the ever-evolving changes in LULC. From the impact on the livelihood patterns of different groups of people, this study uncovers the mysteries behind these changes. Findings unveiled a tale of transformation in the study area. As the years passed, there was a decline in agriculture (7.6%) and fallow land (15.66%), and a surge in water bodies (20.68%) from 1990 to 2019. These significant changes in land use paint a picture of an ever-evolving landscape. From the devastating effects of natural disasters to the pursuit of profit and the drive for industrial advancement, a multitude of drivers are fueling the changes in land use. As literacy rates rise and temperatures fluctuate, the landscape is undergoing a transformation driven by these powerful forces. The ripple effects of LULC changes can be felt throughout the community, leaving a wake of disrupted livelihoods in its path. As opportunities narrow and marginalized groups feel the squeeze, it's crucial for stakeholders to act.

We used the Nam Kong catchment of the Mekong River Basin in Southern Laos, with two hydropower dams in series, to understand the implications of LULC change uncertainty for catchment-level and reservoir-level sediment management options. The catchment-level sediment management options of terracing, vegetative filter strips, and no tillage were evaluated applying the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The reservoir-level sediment management option of flushing was assessed using the Sediment Simulation Screening Python Model (PySedSim). Costs of sediment management options were assessed via the economic value of the loss in hydropower production and the avoided cost of dredging. Our results suggest that LULC projections resulted in high variability in loss of reservoir capacity and cost of sediment management. Terracing was found to be the best catchment-level management option at decreasing both the magnitude and variability in loss of reservoir storage for both dams, but it was also the most expensive option. Flushing was also effective in reducing sedimentation, but it was less economically beneficial compared to catchment-level sediment management options.

This review shows that several African hydropower plants have experienced repeated power disruptions over the last three decades due to climate change and variability but it is less documented how increasing land use and land cover changes around the major dams have impacted the hydrological system and the hydropower generation. In the future, the risks of hydropower in WA may not be equally distributed within a country or region. Despite uncertainties in precipitation and on impacts on streamflow and water level in major basins, climate change is likely to reduce the available water over the range of 10%-20% (15%-40%) for the RCP4.5 (RCP8.5) scenario by 2050, which may considerably affect the water demand across all sectors, including hydropower. However, in the Kainji dam (Niger River basin), models project an increase in rainfall favorable to hydropower production for both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. In contrast, within the Black Volta sub-basin, the intensification of land use is predicted to favor runoff and, consequently, an increase in the generation of Bui hydropower in the near future, even though models predict a rainfall decrease. This increase in land use for agriculture to feed a growing population has other adverse effects that need to be assessed, namely sedimentation and siltation, which are harmful to hydropower plants. Finally, the combined impact of climate and land use changes on the efficiency of hydroelectric infrastructure in WA is not well documented, while sustainable planning and investments in the hydropower sector require consideration of the nexus between climate, land use changes, and water.",West Africa,climate change,land use,land cover,hydropower,nexus,sustainability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This change is mainly due to increasing urbanization, in addition to the change of prevalent mixed forest into deciduous needle/leaf forest in Kerala. Motivated by this finding, we study the impact of these LULC changes over a decade on the extremes of twelve heavy rainfall events in these states through several sensitivity experiments with a convection-permitting Weather Research and Forecasting model, by changing the LULC boundary conditions. We particularly focus on three representative heavy rainfall events, specifically, over (a) Chennai (1 December 2015), (b) Telangana (24 September 2016), and (c) Kerala (15 August 2018). The simulated rainfall patterns of the three heavy rainfall events are found to be relatively better with the use of the 2017 LULC boundary conditions. The improvement is statistically significant in the case of the Chennai and Kerala events. On analysis of these simulations, and output from additional simulations we have conducted for nine other heavy rainfall events, we suggest that the recent LULC changes result in higher surface temperatures and sensible heat fluxes, and a deeper and moist boundary layer. This causes a relatively higher convective available potential energy and, consequently, heavier rainfall. We find the LULC changes in the three states, mainly dominated by the increasing urbanization in Telangana and Tamil Nadu, enhance the rainfall during the heavy rainfall events by 20-25%. This is the first extensive investigation of multiple and multi-regional cases over the Indian region.",heavy rainfall events,land use and land cover,south India,urbanization,WRF model,,,"Ashok, Karumuri",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, five main LULC classes involving: water body, rangeland, cropland, urban area, and bareland were identified. Beside accuracy and transition of LULC maps using User Accuracy (UA), Producer Accuracy (PA), and Kappa Coefficient (KC), the analysis included changes in LULC, Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and LST, as well as the relationship among them when vegetation cover was at its peak. Moreover, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was performed to group these variables using Duncan's test. The results showed that the accuracy of LULC maps were more than 84% for all the years. Furthermore, the conversion of croplands to rangelands showed the most significant changes, with a total of 1311.38 km2 2 during 2001-2021.

The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used as a mediator in the model to accurately assess the impact of climate change on vegetation and subsequent LULC dynamics. The results indicate that temperature exerts a significant negative influence on LULC in the early periods, inducing stress on vegetation and leading to land degradation. However, this influence diminishes over time, possibly due to ecosystem adaptation and the implementation of resilient land management practices. In contrast, the impact of precipitation on LULC, which is initially minimal, increases significantly, highlighting the need for improved water resource management and adaptation measures to mitigate the negative effects of excessive moisture. The NDVI plays a crucial mediating role, reflecting the health and density of vegetation in response to climatic variables. An analysis of lagged effects shows that both precipitation and temperature exert delayed effects on LULC, underscoring the complexity of water dynamics and ecosystem responses to climatic conditions. These results have important practical implications for land resource management and climate adaptation strategies. Understanding the nuanced interactions between climatic factors and LULC can inform the development of resilient agricultural systems, optimized water management practices, and effective land use planning. Future research should focus on refining models to incorporate nonlinear interactions, improving data accuracy, and expanding the geographic scope to generalize findings.

Obtained results from this study indicated that pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations were higher during the dry season, while dissolved oxygen (DO), 5-day biological oxygen demand (BOD5), temperature, total suspended solids (TSS), and total solids (TS) concentrations also changed with the season. The analysis of LULC changes within 1000-m buffer zones around the sampling stations revealed that agricultural and vegetation classes decreased; while built-up, waterbody and barren lands increased. Correlation analyses showed that BOD5, temperature, EC, TDS, and TSS had a significant relationship (5% level) with LULC types. The regression result indicated that BOD5 was sensitive to changing waterbody (predictors, R-2 = 0.645), temperature was sensitive to changing waterbodies and agricultural land (R-2 = 0.889); and EC was sensitive to built-up, vegetation, and barren land (R-2 = 0.833). Waterbody, built-up, and agricultural LULC were predictors for TDS (R-2 = 0.993); and waterbody, built-up, and barren LULC were predictors for TSS (R-2 = 0.922). Built-up areas and waterbodies appeared to have the strongest effect on different water quality parameters. Scientific finding from this study will be vital for decision makers in developing more robust land use management plan at the local level.",water quality,buffer zone,land use,land cover,Bangladesh,,,"Xie, Zhixiao","Kumar, Pankaj",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Combined efforts of standard criteria, rigid check, and detailed recording were conducted to strengthen the robustness of the multitemporal samples. The different compositions ofmetrics and parameters were tested to obtain the optimal support vector machine (SVM) classification results. The ChinaLC dataset has an average overall accuracy of approximately 75%, which is much higher compared with other large-scale land cover datasets.

Yet understandings of the degree and consequences of LULC changes in this diverse agro-ecological region are incomplete. We conduct a systematic literature review of research reported in academic articles tracing and analysing LULC change in Vietnam's northern regions. We find that these studies have tended to take place away from the most mountainous, northern borderlands. The studies nonetheless highlight a diversity of land use land cover changes caused by numerous causes, making the distinction of overall trends difficult. To complement and extend this body of research, we introduce recent LULC change research we have completed in the mountainous border districts of Lao Cai province, on the Sino-Vietnamese border. The heterogeneity of causes of LULC change in both the review articles and our case study points to the importance of adapting land use policies to local agro-ecological and socio-economic conditions and ethnic diversity, taking into account state-farmer relations, household livelihood decision-making, and policy implementation at the commune and district levels.",land use land cover,northern and border upland Vietnam,systematic literature review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Integrating TEK into monitoring and management of these areas allows for community participation, as well as for offering novel insights into sustainable resource use. In this study, we developed a 250 m resolution land-cover map of the Western Guyana Shield (Venezuela) based on remote sensing, and used TEK to validate its relevance for indigenous livelihoods and land uses. We first employed a hyper-temporal remotely sensed vegetation index to derive a land classification system. During a 1300 km, eight day fluvial expedition in roadless areas in the Amazonas State (Venezuela), we visited six indigenous communities who provided geo-referenced data on hunting, fishing and farming activities. We overlaid these TEK data onto the land classification map, to link land classes with indigenous use. We characterized land classes using patterns of greenness temporal change and topo-hydrological information, and proposed 12 land-cover types, grouped into five main landscapes: 1) water bodies; 2) open lands/forest edges; 3) evergreen forests; 4) submontane semideciduous forests, and 5) cloud forests. Each land cover class was identified with a pulsating profile describing temporal changes in greenness, hence we labelled our map as ""The Forest Pulse"". These greenness profiles showed a slightly increasing trend, for the period 2000 to 2009, in the land classes representing grassland and scrubland, and a slightly decreasing trend in the classes representing forests. This finding is consistent with a gain in carbon in grassland as a consequence of climate warming, and also with some loss of vegetation in the forests. Thus, our classification shows potential to assess future effects of climate change on landscape. Several classes were significantly connected with agriculture, fishing, overall hunting, and more specifically the hunting of primates, Mazama americana, Dasyprocta fitliginosa, and Tayassu pecan. Our results showed that TEK-based approaches can serve as a basis for validating the livelihood relevance of landscapes in high-value conservation areas, which can form the basis for furthering the management of natural resources in these regions.",Amazonia,forest conservation,greenness,indigenous people,land cover,land use,remote sensing,"Lobo, Jorge M.","Fa, John E.","Farfan, Miguel A.","Romero, David","Real, Raimundo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this has brought forth the challenge of collecting reference data with a high level of detail for global extents. While photo-interpretation is considered optimal for collecting quality training data for global HRLC mapping, some producers of existing HRLCs use less trustworthy sources, such as existing land cover at a lower resolution, to reduce costs. This work proposes a methodology to extract the most accurate parts of existing HRLCs in response to the challenge of providing reliable reference data at a low cost. The methodology combines existing HRLCs by intersection, and the output represents a Map Of Land Cover Agreement (MOLCA) that can be utilized for selecting training samples. MOLCA's effectiveness was demonstrated through HRLC map production in Africa, in which it generated 48,000 samples. The best classification test had an overall accuracy of 78%. This level of accuracy is comparable to or better than the accuracy of existing HRLCs obtained from more expensive sources of training data, such as photo-interpretation, highlighting the cost-effectiveness and reliability potential of the developed methodology in supporting global HRLC production.",High-resolution land cover,global land cover,training data,reference data,data quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This examination enables the development of effective solutions to mitigate the adverse impacts resulting from such changes. The focus of this research was analyzing alterations in land use/land cover within the Gilgel Gibe Catchment in 1991 - 2021. LULC data of 1991-2021 were derived from multispectral Landsat images. Data were also gathered using field observations and key informant interview. Data of LULC classes (1991-2021) were generated utilizing supervised classification with maximum likelihood algorithm of ENVI 5.1 and ArcGIS 10.5. Change detection analysis and accuracy assessment were done where accuracy levels all the study periods were > 85 %, and the overall Kappa statistics of the periods were > 0.89. Built-up area and cultivated land of the catchment are increasing with increasing magnitude of change; whereas, while forest cover and grazing land of the catchment are shrinking with declining magnitudes of change, shrubland covers and water body are declining with increasing magnitude of change in the catchment. The net increase in degraded land is a reflection of the increasing degradation of natural resources in the catchment. Swift escalation of population and the subsequent raising demand for farmland and forest and shrub (e.g. fuel-wood and construction) products, decline yield, unemployment and lack of alternative income source, and open access and limited conservation of resources are the principal factors for the dramatic shrinkages of grazing, forest, water body and shrubland resources. Thus, concerned bodies should take rehabilitation measures to restore degraded lands, improve production and yield of farmland by increasing improved farm-inputs and irrigation, and create employment and alternative income sources for the youth, women and the poor so as to ensure sustainable rural livelihoods and to curb the impacts on forest, shrubland and other resources.",Land use/land cover change,Forest depletion,Cultivated land expansion,Gilgel gibe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Land cover and management changes, influenced by agricultural policies since the early 20th century, notably during the wheat campaigns of the fascist regime, have exacerbated soil erosion, with the highest rates observed in vertical fallow (964 g m(-2) yr(-1)), wheat (90 g m(-2) yr(-1)) and horizontal fallow (66 g m(-2) yr(-1)). These practices continue to be somewhat relevant today, as cereal production is still being subsidized. However, Quercus, Pines-introduced since agrarian reforms and Portugal's entry into the common agricultural policy (CAP)-and spontaneous vegetation from CAP's set-aside policies and recent land abandonment trends show lower erosion rates, underlining vegetation's role in erosion protection. Using NDVI trend analysis, we distinguish between natural fluctuations and land cover changes impacts. Understanding these changes and how they relate to slope and valley floor dynamics, such as incision, aggradation or stabilization, is crucial for recognizing human influences on the earth's surface.

The annual mean change in latent heat flux, sensible heat flux, and soil temperature demonstrate that the largest changes occur when the land cover changes from forest to urban land as compared to forest to cropland, forest to grassland and forest to open shrubland. The annual mean change in latent heat flux is moderately large for the land cover change from forest to open shrubland when compared to forest to grassland and forest to cropland. The above is attributed to the effects of evapotranspiration, which has high values for the cropland followed by grassland and open shrubland. Furthermore, the triple collocation method is employed to assess the impact of historical land cover change on soil moisture.

The development of the Copernicus Programme by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Union (EU) has contributed to the effective monitoring of the Earth's surface by producing the Sentinel-2 multispectral products. Sentinel-2 satellites are the second constellation of the ESA Sentinel missions and carry onboard multispectral scanners. The primary objective of the Sentinel-2 mission is to provide high resolution satellite data for land cover/use monitoring, climate change and disaster monitoring, as well as complementing the other satellite missions such as Landsat. Since the launch of Sentinel-2 multispectral instruments in 2015, there have been many studies on land cover/use classification which use Sentinel-2 images. However, no review studies have been dedicated to the application of ESA Sentinel-2 land cover/use monitoring. Therefore, this review focuses on two aspects: (1) assessing the contribution of ESA Sentinel-2 to land cover/use classification, and (2) exploring the performance of Sentinel-2 data in different applications (e.g., forest, urban area and natural hazard monitoring). The present review shows that Sentinel-2 has a positive impact on land cover/use monitoring, specifically in monitoring of crop, forests, urban areas, and water resources. The contemporary high adoption and application of Sentinel-2 can be attributed to the higher spatial resolution (10 m) than other medium spatial resolution images, the high temporal resolution of 5 days and the availability of the red-edge bands with multiple applications. The ability to integrate Sentinel-2 data with other remotely sensed data, as part of data analysis, improves the overall accuracy (OA) when working with Sentinel-2 images. The free access policy drives the increasing use of Sentinel-2 data, especially in developing countries where financial resources for the acquisition of remotely sensed data are limited. The literature also shows that the use of Sentinel-2 data produces high accuracies (>80%) with machine-learning classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM) and Random forest (RF). However, other classifiers such as maximum likelihood analysis are also common. Although Sentinel-2 offers many opportunities for land cover/use classification, there are challenges which include mismatching with Landsat OLI-8 data, a lack of thermal bands, and the differences in spatial resolution among the bands of Sentinel-2. Sentinel-2 data show promise and have the potential to contribute significantly towards land cover/use monitoring.",Sentinel-2,ESA,land cover,use,remote sensing,classification,,"Nyirenda, Vincent R.","Murayama, Yuji","Ranagalage, Manjula",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The impacts of chaotic urban growth are all well documented. To overcome the ill effects of urbanisation, continuous monitoring and sustainable planning are the keys. As the future urban growth in India is predicted to take place in small cities of less than a million populations, it is the crucial time to plan a strategy for sustainable urban growth. Mangaluru, being a small, emerging city has the basic fertility required for urban growth. But the deficiencies of spatial data availability and lack of insight for impending urbanisation scenario would hamper the sustainable management of urban growth in the region. In this context, the current study proposes to map land use and land cover and monitor the spatiotemporal dynamics of urban growth in Mangaluru urban agglomeration, India, during 1972-2018. The present study employs techniques of remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) and uses Landsat series of imageries. The land use and land cover changes and dynamics of urban growth have been studied using change detection, Shannon entropy, and spatial trend analysis. The study reveals that the rapid increase in the built-up area is largely induced by intense in fill growth in the core range of the city which is further corroborated by the Shannon entropy value, which indicates the compact nature of city growth. It has been found that built-up area has increased from 3.68% in 1972 to 18.79% in 2018. Agricultural land on the other hand decreased from 36.51-11.22% during 1972-2018 period. The spatial trend of change analysis represents the expansion of built-up land along with the transport network, and predominantly following a north-south course.

Earth observation (EO) data offer a potential solution, through direct or indirect mapping of species or habitats. Most national and international programs rely on the use of land cover (LC) and/or land use (LU) classification systems. Yet, these are not as clearly relatable to biodiversity in comparison to habitat classifications, and provide less scope for monitoring. While a conversion from LC/LU classification to habitat classification can be of great utility, differences in definitions and criteria have so far limited the establishment of a unified approach for such translation between these two classification systems. Focusing on five Mediterranean NATURA 2000 sites, this paper considers the scope for three of the most commonly used global LC/LU taxonomies-CORINE Land Cover, the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) land cover classification system (LCCS) and the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme to be translated to habitat taxonomies. Through both quantitative and expert knowledge based qualitative analysis of selected taxonomies, FAO-LCCS turns out to be the best candidate to cope with the complexity of habitat description and provides a framework for EO and in situ data integration for habitat mapping, reducing uncertainties and class overlaps and bridging the gap between LC/LU and habitats domains for landscape monitoring-a major issue for conservation. This study also highlights the need to modify the FAO-LCCS hierarchical class description process to permit the addition of attributes based on class-specific expert knowledge to select multi-temporal (seasonal) EO data and improve classification.

In our study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis using the 2011-2020 Chinese land cover dataset to examine the impact of ecological function areas on regional land use and cover change. This analysis allowed us to quantify and visualize the intensity, aggregation effects, and transformation paths of land cover change while considering China's ecological function areas. Our findings highlight notable disparities in land cover types between the ecological function area and its surroundings. Within the ecological function area, forest and grassland dominate, constituting 67% of the total land cover. In contrast, outside the ecological function area, there is a greater presence of wasteland, in addition to forest and grassland. Moreover, the abundance of impervious surfaces, which are closely linked to human activities, is significantly higher outside the ecological function area, almost double the amount found inside. By examining specific land cover types, we observed that forests exhibit the least change within the ecological function area, whereas croplands experience the least change outside. Throughout the study period, approximately 8.1% of land cover pixels underwent changes, with some areas displaying a frequency of change reaching up to 2. Interestingly, the number of high-frequency land use and cover change pixels inside the ecological function area is only half of the outside. Notably, a higher percentage of impervious surfaces within the ecological function area (0.13%) were converted into cropland compared to the outside (0.07%).

In this study, we evaluated changes in land use and land tenure in the Tijuana River Watershed, a region of high biodiversity and endemism, following the implementation of a new Agrarian Law which allowed for privatization and sales of communal land (ejidos) beginning in 1992. In order to understand changes in land use and cover, we constructed maps from aerial photographs and Aster images and measured changes between 1994 and 2005. In order to understand changes in land tenure, we collected data from Mexican government sources on ejido land size, ownership, and sales, and we conducted 55 structured interviews with ejiclatarios in the watershed. Our results demonstrate that land-use/cover change between 1994 and 2005 was dominated by an increase in urban area and grasslands, and a decrease in coastal sage scrub, chaparral, and, to a lesser degree, agriculture. In particular, the conversion of coastal sage scrub has left a far more fragmented landscape than existed in 1994. In addition, most of the ejidos in the watershed, as well as individuals interviewed, had participated in some stage of the land certification and titling process allowed by the new Agrarian Law, resulting in substantial changes in land tenure. However, land tenure security appeared to play a larger role than a desire to sell land and, contrary to studies from other regions, full title to the land was obtained in a range of urban and rural settings, rather than primarily on land closest to urban zones. Our results suggest that past predictions regarding future urban growth and fragmentation of native vegetation in the region have proven accurate and highlights regions of change that merit further study.

Although traditional spectral-based change-vector analysis (CVA) can effectively detect LULC change in many cases, it encounters difficulties in RUFAs because of deficiencies in the spectral information of satellite images. To detect LULC changes in RUFAs effectively, this paper proposes an extended CVA approach that incorporates textural change information into the traditional spectral-based CVA. The extended CVA was applied to three different pilot RUFAs in China with different remotely sensed data, including Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS) and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) images. The results demonstrated the improvement of the extended CVA compared to the traditional spectral-based CVA with the overall accuracy increased between 4.66% and 8.00% and the kappa coefficient increased between 0.10 and 0.15, respectively. The advantage of the extended CVA lies in its integration of both spectral and textural change information to detect LULC changes, allowing for effective discrimination of LULC changes that are spectrally similar but texturally different in RUFAs. The extended CVA has great potential to be widely used for LULC-change detection in RUFAs, which are often heterogeneous and fragmental in nature, with rich textural information.

To this end, land-cover specific temperature change factors are quantified for the southern Saskatchewan region using a novel statistical downscaling model: physical scaling (SP). SP model considers large-scale climate and regional physical characteristics like land-cover, elevation in its formulation and hence can be used to predict future temperature for different land-cover types under changing large-scale climatic and land-cover conditions. The model is validated by assessing its ability to downscale North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) derived surface (skin) temperature from an initial resolution of 32 km to 500 m. The downscaled NARR data are evaluated using a cross-validation approach over the period 2006-2013 with reference to MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived surface temperature estimates and satisfactory model performance is obtained (average RMSE=0.03 K).

Three cloud-free Landsat MSS, ETM+, and OLI images covering the study area were employed for analysis. Images were acquired in years 1972, 2000, and 2017, respectively. All images were manipulated using ERDAS Imagine 10 software to achieve the aims of this study. The final output maps have been produced using Arc GIS 10.1. Different methods of data transformation and analysis were applied including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). A supervised classification approach was applied to categorize the images in different land cover classes. Five land use/land cover classes were identified: vegetation, bare soil (sand), bare soil (rocks), urban area, and water bodies.

To that end, soil, land uses, hydro-meteorological data including rainfall, temperatures (maximum and minimum), wind speed, solar radiation, relative humidity and discharge data were used as main inputs. To assess the impact of land uses on the catchment water balance, three different land uses (2000, 2006 and 2011) were used. Results showed that from 2000 to 2011, croplands and fallows increased by 34% while the shrub and grass savannahs decreased respectively by 34 and 24%. In addition, agroforestry and gallery forest decreased by 63% and 58% respectively while a rapid increase in settlement. The study outcome suggested that the SWAT provided satisfactory results for discharge with R-2, NSE, KGE and absolute percent of bias (absPBIAS) ranged between (0.7-0.9), (0.6-0.9). (0.6-0.9) and (5.3-34) respectively. Moreover, the evaluation of land use and land cover changes on the catchment water balance resulted in an increase in annual surface water and water yield, while the groundwater and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) have decreased. Findings of this study may be a great contribution to water resource management in the Couffo catchment.

These data are also relevant in cartography. Land cover changes identified by the method mentioned may contain mistakes caused by over- or underestimation. The paper describes these mistakes. Overestimation (technical change) of the extent of land cover change is caused by adding the residual polygons (smaller than 25 ha) to neighbouring polygons. Underestimation is caused by the fact that discernible changes concerning areas larger than 5 ha which showed up in objects with areas smaller than 25 ha were not identified and, consequently, not included in either CLC90 or CLC2000 data layers; e.g. Dutch CLC_change database users' accuracy indicates an overestimation of 8.8% whereas the comparison of net change indicates a small, insignificant underestimation. In spite of the problems referred to, caused by overestimation or underestimation, the datasets on land cover changes in Europe for the 1990s and the year 2000 ( +/- one year) can also be used for the compilation of land cover change maps at the regional, national and European levels.",cartographic data,land cover,land cover changes,computer-aided visual interpretation,overestimation,underestimation,CORINE Land Cover Project,"Cebecauer, Tomas",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While extensive studies have been conducted in addressing endmember variability (e.g. spectral variability of endmember classes), little research has paid attention to the selection of an appropriate number and types of endmember classes. To address this problem, in this study, we proposed to automatically select endmember classes for temporal mixture analysis (TMA), a variant of SMA, through incorporating land use land cover probability information derived from socio-economic and environmental drivers. This proposed model includes three consecutive steps, including (1) quantifying the distribution probability of each endmember class using a logistic regression analysis, (2) identifying whether each endmember class exists or not in a particular pixel using a classification tree method, and (3) estimating fractional land covers using TMA. Results indicate that the proposed TMA model achieves a significantly better performance than the simple TMA and a comparable performance with the METMA with an SE of 2.25% and an MAE of 3.18%. In addition, significantly better accuracy was achieved in less developed areas when compared to that of developed areas. This may indicate that an appropriate endmember class set might be more essential in less developed areas, while other factors like endmember variability is more important in developed areas.

This study discusses the impact of land-use/land-cover (LULC) change on LST of the area in and around Rajarhat block, North 24-Parganas District, West Bengal, covering an area of 165km(2). Multi-spectral and multi-temporal satellite data from Landsat 5 TM (1990), Landsat 8 OLI (2016) and Sentinel 2A (2016) are used for the LULC mapping, and thermal infrared data from Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 TIRS (2016) are used for estimating the LST of 1990 and 2016. Results show that land-use pattern in November has changed in Rajarhat from 1990 to 2016: 13km(2) of vegetation cover lost due to urbanization; 9.3km(2) of open land converted to agricultural land and open fields/parks; 1.4km(2) of aquaculture ponds converted to tree cover/scrublands and 1.45km(2) of lakes/ponds filled up. Loss of vegetation (scrubland and tree) cover resulted in LST rise by about 1.5 degrees C. Aquaculture ponds have the ability to resist the rise in LST since the increase in temperature of this class is only 0.24 degrees C due to increase in its area. This change in land-use pattern over 26years has increased the LST by 0.94 degrees C. The urban-heat-island (UHI) phenomenon has also increased. The area of the strongest' heat-island phenomenon, as per UTVFI classification scheme, has increased by 20.1km(2). Positive correlation is observed between NDBI and LST's of urban areas (r=0.002 for 1990 and r=0.047 for 2016) which suggests that urbanization is responsible for the rise in LST.

In this study, integration of 31 storm events, monthly monitoring of LULC change, Pearson's correlation, multiple linear regression analysis (MLR) and Personalized Computer Storm Water Management Model (PCSWMM) were applied to quantify the influence of LULC change on stormwater quality from mixed LULC catchment with ongoing land development in Yongin, South Korea. Due to ongoing land development in the catchment, bare land and urban LULC were exponentially increased while agriculture, forest, grassland and water LULC decreased in spatial extent. The correlation analysis showed that stormwater quality was positively correlated to bare land (0.595; Cl - 0.891; TSS, p < 0.05) and urban (0.768; TN - 0.987; TSS, p < 0.05); negatively correlated to forest (-0.593; Cu - 0.532; BOD5, p < 0.05) and grassland (-0.587; TSS - 0.512; BOD5, p < 0.05) and; either positively or no correlation to agriculture (0.064; Cu - 0.871; TSS, p < 0.05) and water (-0.131; Cl - 0.221; TP, p < 0.05). Furthermore, the MLR analysis showed that combinations of different LULC were able to describe the overall stormwater quality of the catchment. Moreover, the LULC scenario analysis demonstrate that under dominant agriculture (S1), bare land (S2) and urban areas (S5), the average pollutant concentrations would increase by as much as 13.22% (Cl; S2; pre-) to 59.25% (TSS; S5; early-active); while under dominant forest (S3) and grassland (S4) the average pollutant concentration would decrease by as much as -53% (Pb; S3; late-active) to -3.22% (BOD5; S4; pre-). These findings explained that the variability of pollutant concentrations in different phase of land development was affected by expansion of bare land and urban spatial extent, increase of hydrological characteristics (total rainfall and average rainfall intensity) and massive soil activities (soil digging and soil transfer).

Well-documented in temperate systems, less is known about the way land cover relates to water quality in low-lying coastal zones in the tropics. Here we evaluate the catchment LULC and the physical and chemical characteristics of six rivers that contribute flow into a seasonally hypoxic tropical bay in Bocas del Toro, Panama. From July 2019 to March 2020, we routinely surveyed eight physical and chemical characteristics (temperature, specific conductivity, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrate and nitrite, ammonium, and phosphate). Our goals were to determine how these physical and chemical characteristics of the rivers reflect the LULC, to compare the water quality of the focal rivers to rivers across Panama, and to discuss the potential impacts of river discharge in the Bay. Overall, we found that the six focal rivers have significantly different river water characteristics that can be linked to catchment LULC and that water quality of rivers 10 s of kilometers apart could differ drastically. Two focal catchments dominated by pristine peat swamp vegetation in San San Pond Sak, showed characteristics typical of blackwater rivers, with low pH, dissolved oxygen, and nutrients. The remaining four catchments were largely mountainous with >50% forest cover. In these rivers, variation in nutrient concentrations were associated with percent urbanization. Comparisons across Panamanian rivers covered in a national survey to our focal rivers shows that saltwater intrusions and low DO of coastal swamp rivers may result in their classification by a standardized water quality index as having slightly contaminated water quality, despite this being their natural state. Examination of deforestation over the last 20 years, show that changes were <10% in the focal catchments, were larger in the small mountainous catchments and suggest that in the past 20 years the physical and chemical characteristics of river water that contributes to Almirante Bay may have shifted slightly in response to these moderate land use changes.

How local ecological assemblages are responding is less clearda concern given their importance for many ecosystem functions and services. The main objectives are to assess status and variation in carbon stocks across land covers and quantify spatial distribution and dynamic variation of terrestrial carbon stocks in response to land use/cover change. This paper presents a methodology for quantifying and assessing changes in carbon stocks as a result of land use change using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model. The model was used to map and quantify carbon stocks for Uganda for 2006 and 2010 land use conditions. Our result showed that the total carbon stocks have a sharp decline from 2.42 billion Tg C in 2006 to 1.72 billion Tg C in 2010 in aboveground, belowground and soil. During 2006 to 2010, losses in carbon stocks from land use and land cover were 705.59 million Tg C. To be more specific, estimated carbon stocks in Uganda decreased 849.94 million Tg C because forest land changed to other land use and covers. Cultivated land change, which is from other types of land, resulting in carbon stocks decreased 71.11 million Tg C, and estimated carbon stocks increased 177.34 million Tg C with grassland changed to other land use and covers. Finally, we suggested potential policy measures to mitigate negative effects of land use and cover change on carbon stocks in Uganda. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The results show that policies and legislation were guided by different goals in different political and socio-economic contexts, and have led different pathways. Before 1951, they were guided by royal orders with the goal of exploiting free labour, increasing land tax revenues, and gaining favor from influential people in the government resulting expansion of agricultural areas, deforestation, and reclamation of waste land. After 1951, they were focused on the redistribution of agricultural land. Later in the 1980s and 1990s, the policies were emphasized on conservation and the people's participation. Recently, the concept of land use zoning was introduced. It also shows that there are overlapping of roles and responsibilities of institutions and lack of coordination among government agencies.

The study used the digital elevation model data for MPs analysis to extract the areal, linear and relief aspects to determine erosion risk mapping further using ArcGIS 10.5 software. The Jigjiga watershed was subdivided into fifteen sub-watersheds and coded as JSW-1 to JSW-15. The MPs and LU/LC types computed values were used to rank and prioritise the sub-watersheds. Jigjiga Sub-watershed, LU/LC types were analysed for erosion risk area mapping using the Compound Priority method. The degree of prioritisation used for this study for the MPs and LU/LC types was very high, high, moderate, low, and very low. Accordingly, the erosion hotspots mapping results showed that the sub-watersheds JSW-15 and JSW-14 were categorised under a high priority based on MPs, whereas the JSW-14 was put under a very high priority by LU/LC.

This socioeconomic, spatial and environmental change has led to a situation unknown for centuries in the Mediterranean landscapes. As a consequence, large wildfires have increased enormously in importance in a society with a predominant urban vision over the rest of the territory. Indeed, public opinion considers wildfires as major natural disturbances related to climate change causing at the end deforestation, while its prerequisite, a substantial increase of forest cover due to rural collapse, is less known. This research aimed to deepen the knowledge about forest evolution and its implications after the land abandonment process that started in the second half of the 20th century.

Results showed that the area dominated by dense forests (shrublands and woodlands) has increased from 17% to 28%, and the area dominated by their transitional land uses after farming abandonment has increased from 8% to 21%. Transition matrices enabled a precise identification of changes among dominant categories over the studied period. Random and systematic transitions between categories have been analysed and a map of forest evolution pathways could be drawn, in which a double alternative path was identified. In the general context of progressive evolution to dense forests in the Mediterranean region, we have also found different evolution rates which may depend on site conditions. Their specific soil and climatic factors should be further analysed in order to improve our understanding of future forest evolution in the Mediterranean region at a local scale. A robust knowledge of these processes will contribute to improve forest management and land-use planning while optimising resilience, carbon storage and the provision of environmental services.",Land use,Land cover,Rural abandonment,Forest evolution path,Transition matrix,,,"Rojas-Briales, Eduardo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LUCC can undermine environmental health. Thus, this study aimed to develop an understanding of LUCC in the Yanqi Basin, Xinjiang, China, an arid area experiencing dramatic water and land resource use. A time series of satellite images (1964, 1973, 1989, 1999, and 2009) were used to calculate the index of landscape patterns to study the processes involved in changes to land uses and landscape patterns and the influence of this changes on landscape patterns. The results show that land uses in the Yanqi Basin have changed dramatically since 1964 with grassland being mainly converted to cropland. Landscape fragmentation and diversity have decreased in the study area, although landscape fragmentation increased from 1964 to 1999 and then decreased by 2009. The index of landscape diversity decreased from 1.64 in 1964 to 0.71 in 2009. The heterogeneity and complexity of the landscape increased during this period. In contrast, the index of dominance decreased from 0.85 in 1964 to 0.83 in 2009. Land use change drives landscape patterns of the development of the watershed toward diversity and a fragmented structure.

F.",The land-cover cascade: Relationships coupling land and water,ECOLOGY,JAN 2007,116,"We introduce the land-cover cascade ( LCC) as a conceptual framework to quantify the transfer of land-cover-disturbance effects to stream biota. We hypothesize that disturbance is propagated through multivariate systems through key variables that transform a disturbance and pass a reorganized disturbance effect to the next hierarchical level where the process repeats until ultimately affecting biota. We measured 31 hydrologic, geomorphic, erosional, and substrate variables and 26 biotic responses that have been associated with land-use disturbance in third- and fourth-order streams in the Blue Ridge physiographic province in western North Carolina ( USA). Regression analyses reduced this set of variables to include only those that responded to land cover and/or affected biota. From this reduced variable set, hypotheses were generated that predicted the disturbance pathways affecting each biotic response following the land-cover-cascade design. Cascade pathways began with land cover and ended with biotic responses, passing through at least one intermediate ecosystem abiotic component. Cascade models were tested for predictive ability and goodness-of-fit using path analysis. Biota were influenced by near-stream urban, agricultural, and forest land cover as propagated by hydrologic ( e. g., discharge), geomorphic ( e. g., stream bank height), erosional ( e. g., suspended sediments), and depositional streambed ( e. g., substrate size) features occurring along LCC pathways, reflecting abiotic mechanisms mediating land-cover disturbance. Our results suggest that communities are influenced by land-cover change indirectly through a hierarchy of associated abiotic components that propagate disturbance to biota. More generally, the land-cover cascade concept and experimental framework demonstrate an organized approach to the generic study of cascades and the complex relationships between landscapes and streams.",disturbance,geomorphology,GIS,hydrology,land-cover cascade,sediment,watershed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study shows the temporal change in land use and land cover pattern of Tso Moriri Lake, the highest altitude lake in India and designated as Ramsar site in year 2002, using multi-sensor and multi-date imagery. Due to change in hydro-meteorological conditions of the region, this lake area has been reduced. Since the lake recharge is dependent on snowmelt, hence change in climatic conditions (less snowfall in winters), to a certain extent, is also responsible for the decrease in water level and water spread of the lake. The result shows that the lake area has reduced approximately 2 km(2) in the last 15 years, and also, agriculture, grasslands, and vegetation cover have increased to a significant extent. Agricultural land and grasslands have doubled while the vegetation cover has increased more than six times, showing the coupled effect of climate change and anthropogenic activities.

The land use data were classified into five types, forest, farmland, grassland, water and built-up, the slope gradients were divided into four grades. Indices for analyzing land use features were defined by their proportions, transformation matrixes, land use degree and changes. The results showed that all land use types can be found at every gradient. Generally, with the slope degree increased, the area of forest being augmented as well, while the area of the other land use types (farmland, grassland and build-up) declined. Moreover, a mass of farmland were shifted from other land use types from 0A degrees to 25A degrees, while a quantity of forest were transformed from the other land use types on > 25A degrees from 1993 to 2009. In terms of land use degree and changes, the area of farmland and buildup land use types decreased when slope degree increased. Finally, we calculated the five landscape pattern metrics: Patch Density (PD) value, Largest Patch Index (LPI), Shannon's Diversity Index (SHDI), Area-Weighted Mean Shape Index (AWMSI) and Contagion Index (CONTAG). The results of metrics analysis showed that PD values, SHDI values and CONTA values had a similar variation trend, that is, they decreased when slope degree increased.

As the inter-correlations among landscape structure and ecological process have great influences on the hydrological process, energy flow, and nutrient cycles, it is important to evaluate the impact of landscape configuration on water quality for individual basins. Spatio-temporal variations of water quality and correlations among land use/land cover and water quality across Taiwan have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, 48 water quality stations within 10 basins across Taiwan are investigated to identify the relationships among various water quality indices, land use/land cover, and landscape metrics at two different time periods. A total of 12 water quality parameters are included: water temperature, pH value, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, total suspended sediment, total phosphorus, ammonia, nitrate, nitrite, and total nitrogen. Two years (1994 and 2007) of land use/land cover were characterized by using landscape metrics to quantify change in landscape configuration. The hypothesis is that individual basin has different characteristics resulting in different water quality - landscape metric relationships. The results showed that high degrees of landscape fragmentation and interspersion are correlated with degradation of water quality, in terms of high biological and chemical oxygen demands, and nitrogen loads, and such significant relationships are found in certain land use types as pollution sources. Only 3 out of 10 basins have strong or moderate impacts of landscape variation on water quality, indicating these findings could provide reference for developing an effective watershed planning and management with further investigations of landscape configuration at the class level.",Water quality,Land cover change,Landscape metrics,Watershed management,,,,"Liao, Ci-Jyun",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This land use and land cover change in turn has influence on various hydrological processes such as soil erosion rate, sediment deposition in rivers and dams and also stream flow pattern in a catchment. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of Land use and Land cover (LU/LC) changes is necessary to assess the impacts of change in the pattern of natural vegetation on the earth's environment. Satellite images can provide useful information regarding spatial and temporal variation of LU/LC in an area. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the dynamics of LU/LC changes using LISS-III data for the years 2007, 2010 and 2013 of Harangi catchment, Coorg District, Karnataka State, India. Also, study compares three classification techniques such as Parallelepiped Algorithm, Minimum Distance to Mean Algorithm and Maximum Likelihood Algorithm based on the value of overall accuracy and kappa coefficient to check the reliability of the methods in classifying images. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient obtained by using Parellelepiped, Minimum distance to mean and Maximum likelihood algorithm for the year 2013 are 81.47% & 0.71, 78.67 & 0.68 and 89.36% & 0.81 respectively. Based on these results, it can be concluded that, among all the three techniques, the Maximum Likelihood Algorithm gave higher accuracy with high kappa coefficient and Minimum Distance to Mean Algorithm gave lower accuracy. The LU/LC change detection results between years 2007 and 2013 indicated a drastic change in forest area, plantation and waste land among all other classes. The forest area decreased dramatically from 183.12 sq. km to 131.02 sq. km. Also, fallow land and water body are decreased from 68.89 sq. km to 42.63 sq. km and 6.71 sq. km to 3.82 sq. km respectively.

Government programs have promoted production diversification as a strategy to improve local incomes and conserve environmentally beneficial shade-tree coffee agroforests. We present results on land use/land cover dynamics in the municipality of Zozocolco de Hidalgo from 1973 to 2006. The municipality is recognized for its indigenous population and poverty, and currently, diversification efforts are being implemented. Our study combines remote sensing and GIS analyses, binary logistic regression and econometric modeling, as well as socioeconomic surveys to evaluate land use/land cover change (LULCC) dynamics and explore potential environmental and socioeconomic drivers. Results show that tree cover and coffee agroforests had largely been conserved during the first decade after the coffee crisis. But, recent trends indicate loss of tree cover in coffee agroforests and their conversion mostly to pasture. Land use/land cover drivers are largely explained by spatially explicit environmental variables such as slope and elevation. Relevant socioeconomic variables such as distance to markets and land use profitability were not significantly related to land use changes in Zozocolco. Surveys revealed that many households had converted coffee agroforests to pasture or agriculture in the past decade and others intended on renting or selling their agroforest plots, mostly for conversion to pasture. Diversification programs may not be sufficient to stem deforestation in lowland and marginal coffee growing regions. Moreover, information about locally varying socioeconomic and cultural contexts needs to be strongly considered in order to formulate effective strategies.",Land use/land cover change,Coffee agroforests,Spatial modeling,Econometric modeling,Veracruz,Mexico,,"Chavez, Edgar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In many cases these rapidly growing peri-urban areas are carved out as new local government units to function separately from the expanding city. Hence, the hitherto agricultural areas are transformed into residential and other urban uses. The overall result of such dynamic spatial and socio-political processes is the rapid change in land use/land cover (LULC). In this study, we assess, measure and explain LULC changes in Accra's western periurban areas with the Awutu Senya East Municipal area (ASEMA) as the spatial context. Located on the west boundary of the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA), the ASEMA is affected by the rapid expansion of GAMA. Adopting GIS and Remote Sensing methods, the study analyses the rate of urban expansion and LULC changes spanning 2014-2020. The study revealed that the urbanised areas have more than doubled representing a 152% change in the urban expanse over the six-year period under investigation. While this could be attributed to the rapid growth and spill-over from GAMA, the study also reveals socio-political and economic factors contributing to rapid changes in LULC in ASEMA.

In the peak fracking period, native vegetation registered a decrease of 48% in the Burgos basin and 25% in the Neuquen basin. In Mexico, the most significant changes occurred in the Culebra field and the Fernandez Oro Station field in the southern country. In both basins, in addition to the loss of native vegetation directly associated with fracking implementation, a decrease was found in areas dedicated to primary activities.

In this study, we build on principles of classical mathematical epidemiology to investigate spatial heterogeneity of disease risk for vector-borne diseases. Land cover delineates habitat suitability for vectors, and land use determines the spatial distribution of humans. We focus on the risk of exposure for dengue transmission on the Hawaiian island of Oahu, where the vector Aedes albopictus is well established and areas of dense human population exist. In Hawai'i, dengue virus is generally absent, but occasionally flares up when introduced. It is therefore relevant to investigate risk, but difficult to do based on disease incidence data. Based on publicly available data (land cover, land use, census data, surveillance mosquito trapping), we map the spatial distribution of vectors and human hosts and finally overlay them to produce a vector-to-host ratio map. The resulting high-resolution maps indicate a high spatial variability in vector-to-host ratio suggesting that risk of exposure is spatially heterogeneous and varies according to land cover and land use.",Aedes albopictus,dengue,basic reproductive rate,spatial analysis,land cover,land use,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Natural vegetation is predicted to be disturbed: 18 % of bushland and 15.07 % of dense bush are expected to be replaced by rural dwellings. This is owing to a potential increase in the rural population and a reduced local economic growth.

The Markov Chains (MC) model is a widely used technique for the spatio-temporal evaluation of LULC changes, allowing the projection of the landscape variability based on the multidirectional potential of LULC changes. This study assessed the LULC changes in a disturbed temperate forest basin of northern Mexico during the period 1990-2019. In addition, three LULC scenarios, employing the MC model, were projected for 2048. Supervised classification techniques were performed on data from Landsat sensors to generate LULC maps. Results from the Kappa Index showed a precision of 85 and 85.8% for the classifications of 1990 and 2019, respectively. During the evaluated period, degradation and deforestation processes in the basin were the main factors of disturbance, causing the pine-oak forest to show the biggest loss of coverage (190.81 km2). Conversely, open lands showed the biggest increase in its coverage, which indicates anthropogenic activities as the main driver causing changes on the ecosystem. Projections for 2048 indicate processes of degradation and deforestation will continue, expecting increases in coverage for open lands, deciduous forest, and secondary forest. The current and projected conditions of the landscape highlight the importance of the implementation of conservation and restoration strategies, as well as responsible public policies in the study area to mitigate the impacts on these ecosystems.

The goal was to identify the driving factors of these changes and to project the five-year trend to 2100. LULC data was obtained from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. The original 86 classes were reclassified to 11 classes. Data analysis and projection were performed using TerrSet 2020. Results from 2007 to 2012 showed that the rate of LULC changes was relatively small. Most changes happened to brush/grasslands, mixed forest lands, farmlands and urban/developed lands. Urban/developed lands and the mixed-forest cover gained while farmlands lost. Using a multi-layer perceptron-Markov chain (MLP-MC) model, we projected the 2015 LULC and validated by actual data to produce a 2100 LULC. Changes from 2012 to 2100 showed that urban/developed lands, as well as brush/grasslands, would continue to gain, while farmlands would lose, although the projected landscape texture would likely be identical to the 2012 landscape.

A systematic review and meta-analysis,LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,OCT 2023,6,"ContextVector-borne diseases (VBD) are a worldwide public health problem for humans and wildlife. 'Global Change' such as habitat alteration and land-use intensification, biotic exchange, the introduction of invasive alien species, and climate change have all been linked to an increased occurrence of VBDs.ObjectivesTo evaluate the impact of land-use and land-cover (LULC) on the transmission of VBDs, we conducted a systematic review of the existing literature on the global effects of land use on VBDs. This was followed by a meta-analysis to test the relationship between LULC intensification and infection prevalence.MethodsOverall, 654 articles met our inclusion criteria for the systematic literature review, and 18 studies fulfilled the requirements for the meta-analysis.ResultsThe systematic literature review identified 162 articles with a total of 2541 data entries on the effect of LULC on VBDs. The majority of the studies were published after 2010, and the spatial distribution of data was biased towards North America and Europe. Overall, 193 different hosts and 144 different vector groups were identified. Avian and human malaria were the most frequently named diseases, with humans and Anopheles mosquitoes the most common host and vector, respectively. Our meta-analysis found that land-use intensity, as well as targets (host and vector), significantly impact the prevalence of VBDs. Tests for both residual heterogeneity and moderators were significant, where lower land-use intensity and vectors were linked to lower VBD prevalence, while medium land-use intensity was associated with higher prevalence. Analysis of the host sub-model supported these findings, with infection prevalence significantly lower in low land-use intensity.ConclusionsThe systematic literature review revealed a temporal increase in publications on this topic, with a significant rise since 2007 and uneven distribution of data across countries, with the United States, Spain, and Brazil being the most prominent contributors and identified a wide range of pathogens and hosts involved in VBD systems, with human and avian malaria being the most commonly mentioned diseases. We also show, through a meta-analysis, that LULC intensification affects VBDs infection prevalence.

The results indicated massive variation of land cover types, which was shown as a reduction in cultivatable land and the expansion of building regions. High-LST regions concentrated on the residential and industrial areas with low vegetation coverage. In the residential region, the population density (PD) had effects on the LST values. Although the area or variation of residential regions was close, lower PD was associated with lower mean LST or LST variation. Thus, decreasing the high-LST regions concentration by reducing the PD may alleviate the urban heat island effect on the residential area.

Driving forces behind LULC changes mainly include rapid growth rates of population and consumption, lack of valuation of ecological services, poverty, ignorance of biophysical limitations, and use of ecologically incompatible technologies. One of the major ecological tragedies of the commons in a Mediterranean region of Turkey is the loss of Lake Amik at the expense of increasing the area of croplands, which used to provide vital ecosystem goods and services for the region. In this study, we aimed at quantifying the effects of past land-use transitions on soil organic carbon (SOC) pools (0-20 cm) in a Mediterranean region of 3930 km(2), between 1972 and 2000. LULC changes were quantified from a time series of satellite images of Landsat-MSS in 1972, Landsat-5 TM in 1987, and Landsat-7 ETM+ in 2000 using geographic information systems. The study showed that the increase in croplands between 1972 and 1987 took place at the expense of the irreversible losses of Lake Amik and its related wetlands of over 53 km(2). In the period of 1972 to 2000, croplands, settlements, and evergreen forests increased by 174%, 106%, and 14%, respectively. The increase in settlements occurred mostly to the detriment of croplands. Given the average rates of all the land-use transitions, and associated changes in SOC density for the study region of 3930 km(2), total SOC pool was estimated to decrease by 14.1% from 130.1 Mt in 1972 to 111.7 Mt in 2000.",environmental degradation,land cover,land use,sustainable ecosystem management,GIS,Turkey,,"Demirkesen, A",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are currently two major indicators for accuracy assessment of change detection: the binary change accuracy (ca) and the overall transition accuracy (ta). The overall transition accuracy has been recommended over change accuracy, because the binary change accuracy does not consider the accuracy of the types of changes of the underlying land cover classes. However, the application of overall transition accuracy has been limited by the challenge of collecting enough representative samples with a practical sampling strategy to meet the users' requirement of precision. This study provides an iterative sampling framework to ensure that the precision of the estimated overall transition accuracy meets the users' predefined requirement. We use a set of simulated change maps to comprehensively examine the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed sampling strategy. The simulation-based results demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve satisfactory performance for transition accuracy assessment and it is robust against different properties of classification results and target landscapes, including the degree of fragmentation, proportions of land cover types, and temporal correlation of the classification error between individual dates.

Therefore, this study integrates the use of multisource and multiresolution remote sensing and topographic and field-based datasets for the case of the Mu Us Sandy Land (MUSL) in northern China. The research aim was to quantify LUCC from 1965 to 2015 and describe the relationship between policy changes and land-use types during three stages: the stage of the Great Cultural Revolution, the stage of the modernization of the economy, and the stage of the Great Ecological Project. The results indicated that land use was affected by different national policies because of the national approach to land use during different periods. In the stage of the Great Cultural Revolution, the amount of cultivated land increased, and the environment deteriorated under the influence of leftists. In the stage of the modernization of the economy, vegetation coverage improved after the initial damage, and cultivated and artificial surfaces also increased. In the stage of the Great Ecological Project, cultivated land and unused land decreased, and woodland and sparse vegetation increased with the implementation of the Grain for Green Project (GGP).

However, the nature-based solutions provided by trees are not distributed equally; land use contributes to this systematic inequality because the places where it is easiest to plant trees are often not where trees are needed most. To better understand the gaps and opportunities for tree planting across the urban landscape, we examine the distribution of tree canopy cover and connectivity by land use in 10 U.S. cities. We find that parks have the greatest tree canopy coverage followed by single-family residential areas, multi-family residential areas, and industrial land uses. On average, single-family neighborhoods had 8.5 % points more tree canopy coverage than multi-family neighborhoods, with gaps as high as 18.6 % points. Looking at the size of connected tree canopy, we find that residential land uses are home to more small contiguous tree canopy patches (>1 ha in area), while parks have more large contiguous tree canopy (>12 ha in area). We compare the contiguous tree canopy findings to tree planting policy in each city to examine the influence of intentional planning for tree connectivity, and close with policy-oriented implications of our results. Namely, we suggest: 1) closing the gap between single-family and multi-family tree canopy cover, 2) factoring connectivity into tree planting and preservation, and 3) taking a context-specific approach to increase tree cover in industrial areas in order to more equitably distribute the climate, ecological, and health benefits of trees.",Tree equity,Land use/land cover,Earth observation,Environmental justice,Urban sustainability,Urban policy,,"Curran, Winifred",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The existing LULC products primarily relied on time-series imagery to classify land by pixel-based classifiers, allowing for local analysis and accurate boundary detection. However, the advent of deep learning has shifted toward the use of patch-based CNN models for generating land cover maps. In this article: 1) we create a training dataset for China using a voting strategy based on three off-the-shelf available LULC products, avoiding the labor-intensive manual annotation. 2) We design a novel CNN-based model for the LULC task, called multimodal fine-grained dual network (dubbed as Dual-Net), which takes dual-date images to generate final maps and reduces the need for gap-free temporal sequences or separate cloud detection. To leverage the correlation between location, date, and category, we embed modal information (dates and geo-locations) into the model. Furthermore, by incorporating low-level constraints and using pseudolabel refinement, we continually improve the performance and achieve more refined segmentation. 3) Due to the lack of a suitable validation dataset for China, we create a new validation dataset called the China Sentinel2 Validation Dataset (CSVD) by manually annotating 733 finely labeled images of 1024 x 1024 pixels of China-specific Sentinel2 data. 4) Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing LULC products and produces more fine-grained segmentation results comparable to other patch-based products.

It is characterized by increased temperature of both the air and ground surface, compared to the surrounding rural landscape, and is a typical feature of the urban climate. As this phenomenon may affect quality of life in the cities, a variety of scientific studies have been carried out. The article provides a review and evaluation of selected published studies devoted to the issue of the urban heat island, from the point of view of the application of land cover and land use data in the 3-dimensional microscale urban model. Part of the review brings into focus the MUKLIMO model, which computes the atmospheric conditions in urban landscapes and predicts thermal and other climatic characteristics. Evaluated studies confirmed the correlation between the land cover / land use classes and occurrence of the urban heat islands, i.e. a higher percentage of impermeable surfaces within the urban heat island causes more intensive thermal manifestation. The urban heat island effect diminishes when there are less impermeable surfaces and a greater representation of urban greenery in land cover / land use classes.",local climate zone,land cover,land use,urban heat island,MUKLIMO model,,,"Holec, Juraj","Stastny, Pavel","Pazur, Robert","Bobal'ova, Hana",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major purpose of this study was to develop a new method to fuse lower spatial resolution multispectral satellite images with higher spatial resolution panchromatic ones to assist in land use/cover mapping. An algorithm of a new fusion method known as edge enhancement intensity modulation (EEIM) was proposed to merge two optical image data sets of different spectral ranges. The results showed that the EEIM image was quite similar in color to lower resolution multispectral images, and the fused product was better able to preserve spectral information. Thus, compared to conventional approaches, the spectral distortion of the fused images was markedly reduced. Therefore, the EEIM fusion method could be utilized to fuse remote sensing data from the same or different sensors, including TM images and SPOT5 panchromatic images, providing high quality land use/cover images.",EEIM,fusion,land cover,land use,remote sensing,spectral preservation,,"Huang, SE","Zhao, QG",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Orbital remote sensing and modelling are used to estimate BB emissions on regional to global scales, but these estimates are subject to errors related to the parameters, data, and methods available. For example, emission factors (mass emitted by species during BB per mass of dry matter burned) are based on land use and land cover (LULC) classifications that vary considerably across products. In this work, we evaluate how BB emissions vary in the PREP-CHEM-SRC emission estimator tool (version 1.8.3) when it is run with original LULC data from MDC12Q1 (collection 5.1) and newer LULC data from MapBiomas (collection 6.0). We compare the results using both datasets in the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado biomes during the 2002-2020 time series. A major reallocation of emissions occurs within Brazil when using the MapBiomas product, with emissions decreasing by 788 Gg (-1.91% year-1) in the Amazon and emissions increasing by 371 Gg (2.44% year-1) in the Cerrado. The differences identified are mostly associated with the better capture of the deforestation process in the Amazon and forest formations in Northern Cerrado with the MapBiomas product, as emissions in forest-related LULCs decreased by 5260 Gg in the Amazon biome and increased by 1676 Gg in the Cerrado biome. This is an important improvement to PREP-CHEM-SRC, which could be considered the tool to build South America's official BB emission inventory and to provide a basis for setting emission reduction targets and assessing the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.",biomass burning,land use and land cover,remote sensing,modelling,Amazon,Cerrado,,"de Oliveira, Gabriel","Jones, Matthew W.","Freitas, Saulo R.","Aragao, Luiz E.

Here, we proposed a new change detection method to reduce false detections while maintaining low omission errors. First, the time series is decomposed into three components in the temporal scale which is seasonal, linear trend and noise. The potential LULCC are detected in the seasonal component to keep a low omission rate. Second, the false alarm rate is reduced by combining the breakpoint information of all the spectral bands and the post-classification result. Finally, the information of neighboring pixels is utilized to reduce false alarm further. With Kansas City as the study sites, the results demonstrated the effectiveness and stability of the proposed approach.

This study proposes a validation schema to evaluate the reliability of land cover products, including two methods, namely, result reliability evaluation and process reliability evaluation. Result reliability evaluation computes the reliability of land cover products using seven reliability indicators. Process reliability evaluation analyzes the reliability propagation in the data production process to obtain the reliability of land cover products. Fuzzy fault tree analysis is introduced and improved in the reliability analysis of a data production process. Research results show that the proposed reliability evaluation scheme is reasonable and can be applied to validate land cover products. Through the analysis of the seven indicators of result reliability evaluation, more information on land cover can be obtained for strategic decision-making and planning, compared with traditional accuracy assessment methods.

This is also the case for Alage watershed located in the cental Rift Valley system. This study aimed at assessment of soil erosion hazard and its relation to land use land cover change in the watershed during the period from 1984 to 2016 for a better land management. The study is based on application of Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) to extract inputs factor values for the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). Time-series satellite imageries of Landsat TM 1984, ETM+ 2000 and OLI 2016 were used for land use land cover change detection and determination of cover management (C) factor of the RUSLE. Biophysical data such as rainfall, soil properties, land management practices including soil and water conservation measures within the watershed were collected using field survey and secondary data sources. Slope steepness and slope length factors were derived using Digital Elevaition Model (DEM). Long-term average annual soil loss rates were estimated by the RUSLE integrated with GIS for 1984, 2000 and 2016. Using satellite imageries, the land use land cover and changes within the watershed during the three periods were obtained through a supervised classification with maximum likelihood algorithim. The results of land use land cover change indicated that the proportion of rain-fed cropland, bare land and built up areas increased by 17.4%, 5.9% and 2.9% respectively over the three study period. In contrast the proportion of bush/shrub land, irrigated cropland, grass land, forested areas and waterbodies decresaed by 15.5%, 4.7%, 3.4%, 2.3% and 0.3% respectively during the same period. Estimated average annual soil loss rates showed an increasing trend from 24.3 ton ha-1 yr- 1 in 1984 to 38 ton ha-1 yr- 1 in 2016. Increasing trends of average annual soil loss rate is attributed to increased proportion of cropland, bare land and built up areas during those periods leading to decreased protective vegetation cover. Hotspot areas within the watershed require implementation of land management practices to prevent further degradation and expansion of gullies.

Although most past and current analyses focus on detecting changes between two or more times, the opening of the USGS Landsat archive in 2009 has enabled exploration of methods for higher-frequency, time-serial monitoring of land cover dynamics. Modifying the protocols used to develop the 2001 National Land Cover Database (NLCD 2001), we fit a single classifier to a spatio-temporally distributed reference sample and applied the model to 55 Landsat-5 images covering a section of the North Carolina Piedmont Plateau from 1984 to 2007. A generalized classification scheme, multi-temporal sampling design, supervised classification based on intra-annual spectral indices, and design-based accuracy assessment yielded a time-series of 16 land cover maps from 1985 to 2006 with a spatial extent of 1.7x 10(6) ha, minimum mapping unit of 1 ha, and mean temporal interval of <2 years. Comparable to accuracy of the NLCD 2001 Land Cover Layer for the region, overall accuracy for a spatio-temporally independent test sample was 75%, with K=0.7. When weighted by class proportions, percent correctly classified and kappa rose to 88% and 0.84, respectively. The resulting map series shows spatially and temporally complex changes in water, urban, forest, and herbaceous cover resulting from natural and anthropogenic processes that would not be observable in either unior bi-temporal maps. Agricultural crop area dropped from similar to 45% in the 1980s to similar to 36% in the 1990s and then rose slightly to similar to 38% at the end of the period. Forest area increased to a maximum of similar to 55% in the 1990s and then dropped to similar to 53% in 2005. Urban growth appeared to be most rapid in the 1980s and 1990s and slowed thereafter. With continued focus on the semantics, causation, sampling, and uncertainty underlying spectral land cover classification, long-term series of Landsat images will provide increasingly robust, reliable records for a growing scientific user community. These multi-temporal datasets will be indispensable for understanding past land cover dynamics and predicting the implications of future change on the provision and management of ecosystem services.

Identifying the historic land-use change process is important for the new economic development belt (the Zhujiang-Xijiang Economic Belt, ZXEB). During this research, based on long-time-series land-use and land-cover data, while using a combination of a transition matrix method and Markov chain model, the authors derive the patterns, processes, and spatial autocorrelations of land-use and land-cover changes in the ZXEB for the periods 1990-2000 and 2000-2017. Additionally, the authors discuss the spatial autocorrelation of land-use in the ZXEB and the major drivers of urbanization. The results indicate the following: (1) The area of cropland reduces during the two periods, and woodland decreases after the year 2000. The woodland is the most stable land-use type in both periods. (2) Built-up land expansion is the most important land-use conversion process; the major drivers of built-up land expansion are policy intervention, GDP (gross domestic product), population growth, and rural population migration. (3) Transition possibilities indicate that after 2000, most land-use activities become stronger, the global and local Moran's I of all land-use types show that the spatial autocorrelations have become more closely related, and the spatial autocorrelation of built-up land has become stronger.

Our objectives were to determine how driving forces at different scales change over time, how these forces affect the dynamics and patterns of land use/land cover, and how land-use/land-cover change affects ecological properties at the landscape scale. To accomplish these objectives, we first developed a way to identify the causes and consequences of change at a landscape scale by integrating tools from ecology and the social sciences and then applied these methods to a case study in Ghibe Valley, southwestern Ethiopia. Maps of land-use/land-cover change were created from aerial photography and Landsat TM imagery for the period, 1957-1993. A method called 'ecological time lines' was developed to elicit landscape-scale explanations for changes from long-term residents. Cropland expanded at twice the speed recently (1987-1993) than two decades ago (1957-1973), but also contracted rapidly between 1973-1987. Rapid land-use/land cover change was caused by the combined effects of drought and migration, changes in settlement and land tenure policy, and changes in the severity of the livestock disease, trypanosomosis, which is transmitted by the tsetse fly. The scale of the causes and consequences of land-use/land-cover change varied from local to sub-national (regional) to international and the links between causes and consequences crossed scales. At the landscape scale, each cause affected the location and pattern of land use/land cover differently. The contraction of cropland increased grass biomass and cover, woody plant cover, the frequency and extent of savanna burning, and the abundance of wildlife. With recent control of the tsetse fly, these ecological changes are being reversed.

Our results show that most of the vegetation in the study area transitions to bare land and infrastructure during both time intervals, while most of the bare areas transition to infrastructure and vegetation. Furthermore, the TOC analysis shows vegetation loss, gain in infrastructure, and bare land occurs more intensively at segments between increased thresholds of LST values during both time intervals. Conversely, vegetation gain, infrastructure, and bare land loss occur more intensely at segments between decreased LST values.

The study aims to compare the canopy UHI hotspots and heat sinks with respect to urban land use/land cover, and population density as the prominent determinants in urban areas. Traverse surveys were carried during the summer and winter seasons, 2012-2014, to measure nocturnal mean canopy UHI intensity. The nocturnal mean canopy UHI intensity was observed as 2.14 degrees C during summer and 2.36 degrees C during winter traverse surveys within Nagpur. Canopy UHI effects were found to be most prevailing in high building density and high population density areas. Densely populated areas with less vegetation exhibited the highest canopy UHI hotspots and areas with the least canopy UHI are the heat sink spots. The impact of vegetation is negative because it weakens the canopy UHI effect. On the contrary, population density could strengthen the canopy UHI effect in this case study. The study concludes that changes in land use/land cover of any specific land parcel and their respective vegetation cover and population density distribution lead to canopy UHI formation in Nagpur, India, urban areas. There is a need to frame a strategic mitigation plan with respect to land use/land cover classes and population density distribution within Nagpur urban areas to avoid further formation of canopy UHI and achieve urban sustenance.

As the world's longest consistent operational land cover monitoring product, CLC maps have been produced for reference years 1990, 2000, 2006, 2012 and now for 2018. This paper presents the results from the CLC2018 mapping project in the UK and analyses the results of the land cover status layer and the change layer from the period 2012-2018. It sets this change in context with the change results from the period 2006-2012 and finds that the rate of change between the subsequent CORINE land cover maps is continuing to increase. Changes mapped for the period 2012-2018 covered 76,032 ha greater than the change mapped between 2006 and 2012, an increase of 26% of mapped change. The area of changes mapped covered an area equivalent to 1.16% of the total land area of the UK. The number of different types of changes also continue to diversify; however, the dominance of rotational forestry is consistent with the previous map. The process of urban land take has been highlighted in the results between 2012 and 2018 and is a trend identified in previous iterations of the CLC inventories. The largest gain is in industrial or commercial units (an increase of 14.4%). This growth is mainly attributed to renewable energy infrastructure. As well as the descriptive analysis, the results have been analysed to identify the likely pressures being experienced on the land in the UK.

This study aims to provide evidence on the effects of LULC change on the streamflow of the Akaki catchment that hosts Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. Since the comparative performance of classification algorithms is poorly understood, we compared the performance of one parametric and five non-parametric machine learning methods for LULC mapping using Landsat imageries. To investigate the effect of LULC changes on streamflow, a semi-distributed HEC-HMS model was calibrated and validated using daily discharge data at multiple sites. Findings of this study showed that: (i) the accuracy of classification and regression tree (CART) was superior to the other classifiers, (ii) from 1990 to 2020, urban and forest cover increased at the expense of agricultural and bare land, (iii) the performance of the HEC-HMS model was acceptable at all stations during both the calibration and validation periods, and (iv) the mean annual and main rainy seasonal streamflow of the catchment experienced significant increases due to LULC change but the simulated streamflow changes highly varied with the type of LULC classifier.

Of special concern is the loss of mangrove forest in coastal areas such as Quang Ninh, Vietnam, which is adjacent to the World Heritage-listed Ha Long Bay. Understanding the status and changes of land cover/land use for coastal shrimp farms and mangrove forests can support environmental protection and decision-making for sustainable development in coastal areas. Within this context, this paper uses the 1999/2001 Landsat ETM+ and the 2008 ALOS AVNIR-2 imagery to investigate the contraction and expansion of shrimp farms and mangrove forests in coastal areas of Ha Long and Mong Cai, which now have a high concentration of intensive and semi-intensive shrimp farms. Images were separately analyzed and classified before using post-classification comparisons to detect land cover/land use changes in the study area. The results of this study found that the area of mangrove forest has been reduced by an estimated 927.5 ha in Ha Long and 1,144.4 ha in Mong Cai, while shrimp farming areas increased by an estimated 1,195.9 and 1,702.5 ha, respectively, over the same period. The majority of shrimp farms in Mong Cai were established at the expense of mangrove forest (49.4 %) while shrimp farms in Ha Long were mainly constructed on areas previously occupied by bare ground (46.5 %) and a significant proportion also replaced mangroves (23.9 %). The remarkable rate of mangrove loss and shrimp farming expansion detected in this study, over a relatively short time scale indicate that greater awareness of environmental impacts of shrimp farm expansion is required if this industry is to be sustainable, the important estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems are to be protected over the long term, and the capturing and storing of carbon in mangrove systems are to be enhanced for global climate change mitigation and for use as carbon offsets.",Mangrove,Shrimp farm,Land cover,Land use,Landsat ETM,ALOS AVNIR-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Today there is an increasing demand to obtain sound information about the future development of LUC. Climate modellers, hydrologists, landscape planners, decision makers need reliable scenarios for future development of LUC. Therefore different land use and land cover change models (LUCC) have been developed over the last 10 years. But most of them are difficult to use, not easy to extend or awkward to combine with other models.Before that background, the eXtendable Unified Land Use and land cover modelling platform (XULU) was developed as a generic framework which can be used for several model types (e.g. statistic dynamic, agent based) in miscellaneous scopes of application (e.g. regional LUCC, urban growth). XULU is realised as a stand-alone JAVA application with a universal graphical user interface (GUI) which provides the general features needed for modelling: data storage, I/O methods, visualisation and model flow control. With these components realised once, there is no need for model developers to implement their own (especially complex GUI programming). With XULU it is possible to combine different models (e.g. agent based and statistical approaches). Because using the same data basis time-consuming data conversion is not necessary.In XULU a model is implemented as a JAVA class. So the full power of this modern object-orientated programming language can be used for model implementations. To support model implementation for JAVA-unexercised users, XULU provides a little code generator which creates a source code frame of the necessary JAVA classes.One of the main issues of XULU is the plug-in based concept. New data types, I/O methods and visualisation tools can be integrated without changing the core XULU application. At present there are plug-ins to maintain and visualize raster and vector data, but with new plug-ins it is also possible to use XULU for completely other approaches than LUCC (e.g. economical problems).XULU was applied successfully for modelling LUCC in different scales in West Africa and GermanyThe current work is to integrate a Geo-Toolbox into XULU - especially a statistical module -, which supports data pre-processing directly in XULU. To reach a good performance also for complex models and big scenarios the parallelisation of model processes to several computers is part of the current activity, as well as the coupling of various independent models.",LUCC,modelling,decision support systems,land use planning,,,,"Cremers, A.

Human activities (e.g., crop cultivation, livestock grazing, urban development, construction of infrastructure) in the basin have resulted in substantial changes in land cover, particularly since late 1980s. In this paper we used Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data to study the land use/cover change in the Xilin River Basin, Inner Mongolia. High-quality (less than 10% cloud cover) TM/ETM+ images (WRS124-29 and WRS124-30) acquired on four different dates (July 31, 1987, August 11, 1991, August 27, 1997, and May 23, 2000) were collected for this study. The Xilin River Basin is within two Landsat images (WRS124-29 and WRS124-30), and therefore, we mosaic WRS124-29 and WRS124-30 images and then cookie-cut it for the Xilin River Basin after preprocessing of the images. Based on the vegetation and land use characteristics of the basin, a hierarchical land cover classification scheme was created, including identification of major grassland types (e.g., Stipa grandis, Leymus chinensis). Then we conducted image classification using both supervised and unsupervised classification methods. Ancillary data such as vegetation map, soil map, topography maps, field survey data and literature of the Xilin River Basin were used for interpretation and labeling of spectral clusters as well as accuracy assessment of land cover classification. Finally, the resultant classification results of those four dates were used to quantify the spatial extent of land use/cover change in the basin and to develop the transitional matrix of land use/cover changes since 1987. The results derived from this study could be linked to biogeochemical models for assessing the consequence of land use/cover change on carbon and nitrogen dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems in the basin.",land use/cover change,Xilin River Basin,Inner Mongolia,multi-temporal,remote sensing,,,"Zhuang, DF",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ECOSYSTEMS DYNAMICS, ECOSYSTEM-SOCIETY INTERACTIONS, AND REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS FOR SEMI-ARID AND ARID LAND, PTS 1 AND 2",,,,,,,,,,,,

This study is designed to classify land use and land cover in the upper Blue Nile River Basin (BNRB) using a random forest (RF) algorithm. The Landsat images for Landsat 45, Landsat 7, and Landsat 8 are used for classification purposes. The study area is classified into seven land use/land cover classes: cultivated lands, bare lands, built-ups, forests, grazing lands, shrublands, and waterbodies. The accuracy of classified images is 83%, 85%, and 91% using the Kappa index of agreements. From 1983 to 2022 periods, cultivated lands and built-up areas increased by 47541 and 1777 km2, respectively, at the expense of grazing lands, shrublands, and forests. Furthermore, the area of water bodies has increased by 662 km2 due to the construction of small and large-scale irrigation and hydroelectric power generation dams. The main factors that determine agricultural land expansion are related to population growth. Therefore, land use and land cover change detection using a random forest is an important technique for multispectral satellite data classification to understand the optimal use of natural resources, conservation practices, and decision-making for sustainable development.Random Forest-based land use/cover classification is an effective way to classify satellite data.

A transition in land use is not a fixed pattern, nor is it deterministic. Land use transitions can be caused by negative socio-ecological feedbacks that arise from a depletion of key resources or from socio-economic change and innovation that take place rather independently from the ecological system. Here, we explore whether the sources of land use transitions are mostly endogenous socio-ecological forces or exogenous socio-economic factors. We first review a few generic pathways of forest transition as identified in national case studies, and evaluate the varying ecological quality of expanding forests associated with these pathways. We then discuss possible explanatory frameworks of land use transitions. We use the case of the recent forest transition in Vietnam as an illustration. Socio-ecological feedbacks seem to better explain a slowing down of deforestation and stabilization of forest cover, while exogenous socio-economic factors better account for reforestation. We conclude by discussing the prospects of accelerating land use transitions in tropical forest countries. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This study analyzed the LULC dynamics from 1989 to 2019. The primary objective of the study was to assess its impact on ecosystem services (ES). The ESV was determined using LULC analysis and established global ESV coefficient. The LULC analysis showed a reduction in forest cover by 84.73% during the study period. Built-up, cultivated land, bare land, shrubs, and grassland increased considerably. Rapid population growth, climate change, government policy conflicts, and poverty were identified as the most important drivers of LULC dynamics.

However, human activities, especially a significant increase in population, in-migration and accelerated socioeconomic activities, are constantly modifying the land use and land cover (LULC) pattern. The impact of such changes in LULC on the hydrological regime of a basin is of widespread concern and a great challenge to the water resource engineers. While studying these impacts, the issue that prevails is the selection of a hydrological model that may be able to accommodate spatial and temporal dynamics of the basin with higher accuracy. Therefore, in the present study, the capabilities of variable infiltration capacity hydrological model to hydrologically simulate the basin under varying LULC scenarios have been investigated. For the present analysis, the Pennar River Basin, Andhra Pradesh, which falls under a water scarce region in India, has been chosen. The water balance components such as runoff potential, evapotranspiration (ET) and baseflow of Pennar Basin have been simulated under different LULC scenarios to study the impact of change on hydrological regime of a basin. Majorly, increase in builtup (13.94% approx.) and decrease in deciduous forest cover (2.44%) are the significant changes observed in the basin during the last three decades. It was found that the impact of LULC change on hydrology is balancing out at basin scale (considering the entire basin, while routing the runoff at the basin outlet). Therefore, an analysis on spatial variation in each of the water balance components considered in the study was done at grid scale. It was observed that the impact of LULC is considerable spatially at grid level, and the maximum increase of 265 mm (1985-2005) and the decrease of 48 mm (1985-1995) in runoff generation at grid were estimated. On the contrary, ET component showed the maximum increase of 400 and decrease of 570 mm under different LULC change scenario. Similarly, in the base flow parameter, an increase of 70 mm and the decrease of 100 mm were observed. It was noticed that the upper basin is showing an increasing trend in almost all hydrological components as compared to the lower basin. Based on this basin scale study, it was concluded that change in the land cover alters the hydrology; however, it needs to be studied at finer spatial scale rather than the entire basin as a whole. The information like the spatial variation in hydrological components may be very useful for local authority and decision-makers to plan mitigation strategies accordingly.",Hydrology and water resource,Land use land cover change,Runoff potential,Hydrological modelling,Models (physical),Variable infiltration capacity model,Impact assessment,"Nikam, Bhaskar R.","Thakur, Praveen K.","Srivastav, S.

Multivariate regression methods have often been used to examine the response of specific water contaminants to LULC patterns. However, this also resulted in overlooking the ecological process and biased parameter estimates caused by redundancy where some landscape metrics are strongly correlated. In this study, based on ""sourcesink"" landscape theory, Redundancy Analysis (RDA) and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) were used to investigate the relationship between LULC patterns and water quality in the surrounding sub-watersheds of the Danjiangkou Reservoir in the dry and rainy seasons. The results showed that water quality parameters were characterized by seasonal differences. In the dry season, only the proportion of the watershed occupied by urban landscapes (P_Urban) had a significant impact on water quality in watersheds (beta = 0.835, p < 0.001), so the water quality was only affected by point source pollution in the dry season. In the rainy season, specific water contaminants were categorized as organic and inorganic pollutants. The ""sources"" of organic and inorganic pollutants were agricultural and urban land, respectively. However, natural vegetation was not only a ""sink"" of inorganic pollutants, but also a ""source"" of organic pollutants. Furthermore, agriculture and natural vegetation mediated the effects of landscape spatial configuration on the water quality, yet landscape aggregation negatively moderated the relationship between urban and organic pollution. Therefore, watersheds with high landscape aggregation have small agricultural landscapes and large natural vegetation landscapes where water quality is affected by low levels of inorganic pollution and high levels of organic pollution. However, organic pollution from urban sources was aggravated by watersheds with low landscape aggregation. This study revealed the relationships between LULC patterns and water quality in watersheds and reflected the ecological process to a certain extent.",Non-point source pollution,Land-use/land-cover,"""source-sink"" landscape theory",Structural equation modeling,Danjiangkou Reservoir,,,"Zhang, Xinyu","Feng, Yongzhong","Yang, Gaihe","Zhen, Wenchao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pakistan's LULC patterns have undergone huge changes since the 1900s, with no clear mitigation plan. This paper aims to determine LULC and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) changes as well as their causes in Pakistan's Southern Punjab province over four different periods (2000, 2007, 2014, and 2021). Landsat-based images of 30 m x 30 m spatial resolution were used to detect LULC changes, while NDVI dynamics were calculated using Modis Product MOD13Q1 (Tiles: h24 v5, h24 v6) at a resolution of 250 m. The iterative self-organizing (ISO) cluster method (object meta-clustering using the minimal distance center approach) was used to quantify the LULC changes in this research because of its straightforward approach that requires minimal human intervention. The accuracy assessment and the Kappa coefficient were calculated to assess the efficacy of results derived from LULC changes. Our findings revealed considerable changes in settlements, forests, and barren land in Southern Punjab. Compared to 2000, while forest cover had reduced by 31.03%, settlement had increased by 14.52% in 2021. Similarly, forest land had rapidly been converted into barren land. For example, barren land had increased by 12.87% in 2021 compared to 2000. The analysis showed that forests were reduced by 31.03%, while settlements and barren land increased by 14.52% and 12.87%, respectively, over the twenty year period in Southern Punjab. The forest area had decreased to 4.36% by 2021. It shows that 31.03% of forest land had been converted to urban land, barren ground, and farmland. Land that was formerly utilized for vegetation had been converted into urban land due to the expansion of infrastructure and the commercial sector in Southern Punjab. Consequently, proper monitoring of LULC changes is required. Furthermore, relevant agencies, governments, and policymakers must focus on land management development.

The results show that there is a stable and systemic impact of land use/cover types on surface air temperature. The surface warming of each land use/cover type reacted differently to global warming. The OMR trends of unused land (a (c) 3/40.17 A degrees C/decade), mainly comprised by sandy land, Gobi and bare rock gravel land, are obviously larger than those of the other land use/cover types. The OMR over grassland, farmland and construction land shows a moderate decadal warmingabout 0.12A degrees C/decade, 0.10A degrees C/decade, 0.12A degrees C/decade, respectively. Woodland areas do not show a significant warming trend (0.06A degrees C/decade). The overall assessment indicates that the surface warming is larger for areas that are barren and anthropogenically developed. The better the vegetation cover, the smaller the OMR warming trend. Responses of surface air temperature to land use/cover types with similar physical and chemical properties and biological processes have no significant difference. The surface air temperature would not react significantly until the intensity of land cover changes reach a certain degree. Within the same land use/cover type, areas in eastern China with intensive human activities exhibit larger warming trend. The results provide observational evidence for modeling research on the impact of land use/cover change on regional climate. Thus, projecting further surface climate of China in regional scale should not only take greenhouse gas increase into account, but also consider the impact of land use/cover types and land cover change.",surface air temperature,land use/cover types,OMR method,observations,reanalysis,,,Zhang Wei,Ding MingJun,Wang ZhaoFeng,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was an increase in landscape heterogeneity within the watershed that varied from 1.21% in 1992 to 1.34% in 2011, with agricultural practices and forest regions competing due to the expansion of varying intensities of urban development. Normalized stream discharge from multiple subwatersheds increased over time, with an average increase from 0.21 m(3) s(-1) m to 1.64 m(3) s(-1) m over the study period. Land use and precipitation affected stream discharge, with increasing urban development exhibiting a 37% chance of affecting extreme stream flows within the watershed. More importantly, much of the precipitation observed within the watershed temporally affected stream discharge based on expansion of urban settlement within the basin. This caused a higher likelihood of flashiness, as runoff is more concentrated and stream flow became more variable.

While local to regional reconstructions frequently make use of old topographic maps and land use statistics, continental to global reconstructions are mostly model-based reconstructions. As a result they are subject to large uncertainties. A wealth of historic land cover/use maps and statistics have been produced and these are now more accessible due to the ending of copyrights and secrecy statuses, enthusiastic hobby communities and national cartographic institutes or cadastres that have a strategy towards data sharing with society. In this paper we made use of historic statistics and old topographic maps to demonstrate the added value for model-based reconstructions of historic land cover/use for Central Europe back to 1900. We harmonized these diverse data types and different types of historic land data were incorporated into the land use reconstructions. The added value of using these data was evaluated using historical maps by performing a reconstruction with and without the historic information. The accuracy of the land allocation in the historic reconstruction was improved by 16.5% using historic maps. Additionally, historic maps improved the representation of the spatial structure of landscapes.

Additionally, ecosystems and habitats extend across political boundaries, causing more difficulties for ecosystem conservation. LULC in the Kailash Sacred Landscape (KSL) has undergone obvious changes over the past four decades; however, the spatiotemporal changes of the LULC across the whole of the KSL are still unclear, as well as the effects of LULC changes on ecosystem service values (ESVs). Thus, in this study we analyzed LULC changes across the whole of the KSL between 2000 and 2015 using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and quantified their impacts on ESVs. The greatest loss in LULC was found in forest cover, which decreased from 5443.20 km(2) in 2000 to 5003.37 km(2) in 2015 and which mainly occurred in KSL-Nepal. Meanwhile, the largest growth was observed in grassland (increased by 548.46 km(2)), followed by cropland (increased by 346.90 km(2)), both of which mainly occurred in KSL-Nepal. Further analysis showed that the expansions of cropland were the major drivers of the forest cover change in the KSL. Furthermore, the conversion of cropland to shrub land indicated that farmland abandonment existed in the KSL during the study period. The observed forest degradation directly influenced the ESV changes in the KSL. The total ESVs in the KSL decreased from 36.53 x 10(8) USD y(-1) in 2000 to 35.35 x 10(8) USD y(-1) in 2015. Meanwhile, the ESVs of the forestry areas decreased by 1.34 x 10(8) USD y(-1).

This paper addresses implementation of the biosphere reserve associated with the New Jersey Pinelands Comprehensive Management Plan (PCMP). We present results of a statistical analysis assessing claims that the plan has managed to direct growth and land-cover change in a manner consistent with environmental objectives. We show that it has had a strong effect in reducing conversion of natural areas in the Pinelands reserve, and that the effect observed is consistent with biosphere theory. In particular, conversion is lowest in the protection core, and increasing in the protective buffers. Evidently, multiple jurisdictions can unite to reduce the pace of regional ecosystem degradation. We conclude the paper with speculations about the prospects for implementing biosphere planning more broadly, given the apparent success of the PCMP.",land use and land-cover change,ecosystem management,biosphere reserve,geographic information systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The interpretation of the impact of these changes on areas with very high potential for three regulating ecosystem services (ESs) (local climate regulation, regulation of waste, and water purification) was performed. Forest habitats are the major LULC class category in the ""Nordul Gorjului de Vest"" Natura 2000 site, with broad-leaved forest as the dominant forest class. In terms of areas lost or gained by the different LULC classes for each analyzed time interval, most transformations took place in the period 2000-2006, changes which were also reflected in the overall study period (1990-2018). During this time frame, the conversion of transitional forest shrubs into broad-leaved forest, which is the second largest transition in terms of absolute area changed, led, in terms of contribution rates, to an increase in the areas with very high potential for two of the three analyzed ESs.

Processing this data according to the Region of Interest (ROI) in order to extract meaningful information is challenging. The most crucial part of this process is to identify various land covers very accurately. Only an automatic classification provides a feasible solution, as the manual process is tedious, expensive, and time-consuming. This paper compares two different image classification algorithms in classifying the covers, which can be utilized for land use and land cover changing pattern analysis in the Varanasi district of India. The experiments were carried out with the two most popular classification algorithms, namely: The Maximum Likelihood classifier and the Minimum Distance classifier. The overall accuracy and kappa co-Efficient values computed are 41.67 and 0.12 for the Minimum Distance Classifier and 82.43 and 0.78 for the Maximum Likelihood Classifier.

The Landsat satellite data has been used to map the LU/LC pattern of 2003 and 2015 of the study area, using indices overlay method. Consequently, the indices overlay have been created using three land-use indices, i.e. modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and enhanced built-up and bareness index (EBBI), and then the maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) has been used for the LU/LC classification. The result illustrates that the built-up area (419.35%) and open land (388.36%) have increased during 2003-2015 while the cropland (- 34.38%), scrubland (- 73.25%), and water bodies (- 58.37%) have declined. Further, northern parts of the district have experienced maximum change in the LU/LC while the southern parts have experienced comparatively low change. The study also reveals that the increase in the built-up area occurred mostly at the cost of cropland and scrubland. The statistical analysis shows that the EBBI and SAVI have high relationships with LU/LC while the MNDWI has a comparatively low relationship.

The understanding of the impacts of LULCC on climate, especially the diurnal temperature range (DTR), is not sufficient in this region. The spatio-temporal processes of LULCC and its impacts on DTR were quantitatively analyzed, using the Terra/Aqua MODIS data (MYD11A2 and MCD12Q1, 2003-2013), on the premise of eliminating or weakening the effects of background climate. Results showed that the areas of croplands, forests, and waterbody increased with the annual rate of 2.84%, 0.95%, and 8.2%, respectively, whereas grasslands and bare land decreased with the annual rate of 0.69% and 7.32%, and built-up remained quite stable during the period of 2003-2013. The annual changing rate of LULC for 2008-2013 was nearly 2.84 times the value for 2003-2008. In general, LULC contributed to a decline of DTR over the whole APENC both at monthly/seasonal timescale. Croplands, forests, and mutual transformation between croplands and grasslands tended to decrease daytime maximum temperature (T-max), resulting in a decline of DTR. The grasslands could reduce the DTR by decreasing T-max and increasing nighttime minimum temperature (T-min). By contrast, the conversion of grasslands into forests tended to increase T-max and decrease T-min, thus a rise of DTR for winter, summer, and autumn had observed.

The study also provided insights into how LST varies within different LULC at the exact spatial locations. These changes in LST did not manifest uniformly but displayed site-specific responses to LULC changes. This study accounts for changing land surfaces' complex physical energy interaction over time.

The method comprises two main stages: (i) estimation of compositional land cover for each data by fuzzy segmentation; and (ii) change analysis using a fuzzy change matrix. The fuzzy segmentation stage outputs fuzzy-crisp and crisp-fuzzy image regions whose spectral and geometric properties are measured to populate the set of predictors used to estimate land cover at single dates. The variant of fuzzy image segmentation is implemented using advanced machine learning techniques and tested in a rapidly urbanizing area using Landsat multi-spectral imagery. Experimental results suggest that the method produces accurate characterization of continuous land cover classes.

Convolutional neural networks were employed in conjunction with satellite imagery analysis to map and quantify the changes in land use and cover. This revealed significant trends and transformations within the peninsula's landscape. The analysis revealed a notable increase in urban expansion, particularly at the expense of natural ecosystems. Furthermore, there was a notable reversion of agricultural lands to grasslands, driven by economic downturns and reduced agricultural activity. These land cover changes underscore the urgency of implementing sustainable land management policies. The study recommends the establishment of conservation easements to protect remaining natural ecosystems, the initiation of reforestation programs to restore degraded lands, and the development of comprehensive water management strategies to address the peninsula's hydrological challenges.

To compare the effect of deforestation on climate with other forcings, climate responses to the changing atmospheric CO2 concentration and solar irradiance are also analysed. When all three Factors are taken into account, dynamics of northern hemisphere temperature during the last 300 years within the model are generally in agreement with the observed (reconstructed) temperature trend. We conclude that the impact of historical land cover changes on climate is comparable with the impact of the other climate forcings and that land cover forcing is important for reproducing historical climate change.",modelling,climate change,climate forcing,land cover change,deforestation,solar irradiance,carbon dioxide,"Kubatzki, C","Petoukhov, V",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,land-atmosphere interaction,climate-biosphere interactions,,,,,,,,,,

We argue that, in order to model the link between socio-economic change and changes in forest cover in a region that is experiencing residential and recreational development and agricultural abandonment, land-use and land-cover change need to be represented as separate processes. Forest-cover change is represented here using two transition probabilities that were calculated from Landsat imagery and that, taken together, describe a Markov transition matrix between forest and non-forest over a 10-year period. Using a three-date land-use data set, compiled and interpreted from digitized parcel boundaries, and scanned aerial photography for 136 sites (c. 2500 ha) sampled from the Upper Midwest, USA, we test functional relationships between forest-cover transition probabilities, standardized to represent changes over a decade, and land-use conditions and changes within sample sites. Regression models indicated that about 60% of the variation in the average forest-cover transition probabilities (i.e. from forest to non-forest and vice versa) can be predicted using three variables: amount of agricultural land use in a site; amount of developed land use; and the amount of area increasing in development. In further analysis, time lags were evaluated, showing that agricultural abandonment had a relatively strong time-lag effect but development did not. We demonstrate an approach to using forest-cover transition probabilities to develop spatially-constrained simulations of forest-cover change. Because the simulations are based on transition probabilities that are indexed to a particular time and place, the simulations are improved over previous applications of Markov transition models. This modeling approach can be used to predict forest-cover changes as a result of socio-economic change, by linking to models that predict land-use change on the basis of exogenous human-induced drivers.

The specific natural environment and extensive human activities have led to substantial land use/land cover changes between 1990 and 2015, such as the decrease in cropland with the increase in forests and grasslands due to the implementation of the Grain for Green Program since 2000 and the expansion of built-up areas with economic development and population growth. However, the effects of these changes on ecosystem service values have not yet been considered. In this study, the approach based on a combination of land use/land cover proxies and benefit transfer is applied to assess ecosystem service value changes resulting from land use/land cover changes in the 1990-2000, 2000-2010 and 2010-2015 periods. The results reveal that the total value of ecosystem services has been reduced by $6.787 million from 1990 to 2000 and increased by $4.6 million from 2000 to 2015. The elasticity analysis shows that a 1% area conversion has induced average value changes of 1.03%, 0.38% and 0.05% in the three periods, respectively.

Based on land-use data (cultivated land, forestland, grassland, built-up land, bare land, and water body) from 1985 to 2020, we analyzed the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of LUCC in the WRB using a land-use transfer matrix and a dynamic change model. The driving forces of LUCC in the WRB in different periods were detected using the GeoDetector, and the selected influencing factors included meteorological factors (precipitation and temperature), natural factors (elevation, slope, soil, and distance to rivers), social factors (distance to national highway, distance to railway, distance to provincial highway, and distance to expressway), and human activity factors (population density and gross domestic product (GDP)). The results indicated that the types and intensities of LUCC conversions showed considerable disparities across different sub-basins, where complex conversions among cultivated land, forestland, and grassland occurred in the LRB, JRB, and UWRB, with higher dynamic change before 2000. The conversion of other land-use types to built-up land was concentrated in the UWRB, MWRB, and DWRB, with substantial increases after 2000. Additionally, the driving effects of the influencing factors on LUCC in each sub-basin also exhibited distinct diversity, with the LRB and JRB being influenced by the meteorological and social factors, and the UWRB, MWRB, and DWRB being driven by human activity factors. Moreover, the interaction of these influencing factors indicated an enhanced effect on LUCC.

However, the influence of forest management on forest productivity change and subsequent LULCC projections remains under-investigated. This study explored the impacts of forest management-induced change in forest productivity on LULCC throughout the 21st century. Specifically, we developed a framework to softly couple the Global Change Analysis Model and Global Timber Model to consider forest management-induced forest productivity change and projected future LULCC across the five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). We found future increases in forest management intensity overall drive the increase of forest productivity. The forest management-induced forest productivity change shows diverse responses across all SSPs, with a global increase from 2015 to 2100 ranging from 3.9% (SSP3) to 8.8% (SSP1). This further leads to an overall decrease in the total area with a change of land use types, with the largest decrease under SSP1 (-7.5%) and the smallest decrease under SSP3 (-0.7%) in 2100. Among land use types, considering forest management-induced change significantly reduces the expansion of managed forest and also reduces the loss of natural land in 2100 across SSPs. This suggests that ignoring forest management-induced forest productivity change underestimates the efficiency of wood production, overestimates the managed forest expansion required to meet the future demand, and consequently, potentially introduces uncertainties into relevant analyses, for example, carbon cycle and biodiversity. Thus, we advocate to better account for the impacts of forest management in future LULCC projections.Land use and land cover change has shown widespread social, economic, and environmental impacts. However, the influence of forest management on forest productivity change and subsequent land use and land cover change projections remains under-investigated. This study explored how changes in forest productivity caused by forest management practices impact land use and land cover throughout the 21st century under various social and economic scenarios. The results show that more intense forest management generally leads to more productive forests. This, in turn, results in smaller changes in land use and land cover. Increasing forest management reduces the need to expand managed forests and helps preserve natural lands by 2100. Ignoring the impact of forest management on forest productivity could lead to biases in projecting forest expansion and wood production and potentially induce uncertainties in carbon cycling and biodiversity.

In total, 12 continuous hydrological models were developed by mainly varying their structure and parametrization (lumped and gridded) and using three LULC datasets: coordination of information on the environment (CORINE), Urban Atlas and Scent (citizen-based). It was found that excess precipitation is negligibly contributed to by soil saturation and is dominated by the runoff over impervious areas. Therefore, imperviousness was the main parameter influencing both sensitivity to land cover and parameterization.

Such a challenging problem, which is common to a variety of operational information services and applications (e.g., agriculture, forestry, spatial planning, ecosystem monitoring, disaster management, habitat mapping, etc.), can be effectively solved by traditional supervised classification techniques provided that an exhaustive ground truth is available for all the land-cover classes present in the region of interest. Such a requirement is seldom satisfied and presents several practical drawbacks and limitations, both in terms of time and economic cost that may render this task difficult to achieve in most real-life cases. However, the possibility to perform an effective targeted classification using only ground-truth samples for the class(es) of interest (hence avoiding the burden and cost associated with the collection of a full and exhaustive ground-truth information) would represent a significant advantage. In this paper, we present a novel technique capable of identifying specific land-cover classes of interest by exploiting the ground truth only available for these targeted classes, while providing accuracies comparable to those of traditional fully supervised methods. The proposed technique jointly exploits both the unlabeled samples of the image under investigation and the training samples only available for the targeted classes. In particular, the expectation-maximization algorithm and Markov random fields are employed to estimate the probability density function of both the class(es) of interest and the unknown class representing the merger of all the unknown land-cover classes characterizing the study area for which no ground-truth information is available. An extensive experimental analysis and cross-comparisons with both fully supervised support vector machines and ensembles of multiple one-class support-vector-data-description classifiers on different data sets confirmed the effectiveness and the reliability of the proposed technique.",Agriculture,expectation-maximization (EM),land-cover classification,Markov random fields (MRFs),one-class classifiers,targeted land-cover classification (TLCC),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Land Use Land Cover (LULC) changes were examined as a significant tool for assessing changes at diverse temporal and spatial scales. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has the potential ability to signify the vegetation structures of various eco-regions and provide valuable information as a remote sensing tool in studying vegetation phenology cycles. In this study, we used remote sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques with Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) to identify the LULC changes for 40 years in the Sahiwal District. Later, we conducted 120 questionnaires administered to local farmers which were used to correlate climate changes with NDVI. The LULC maps were prepared using MLC and training sites for the years 1981, 2001, and 2021. Regression analysis (R-2) was performed to identify the relationship between temperature and vegetation cover (NDVI) in the study area. Results indicate that the build-up area was increased from 7203.76 ha (2.25%) to 31,081.3 ha (9.70%), while the vegetation area decreased by 14,427.1 ha (4.5%) from 1981 to 2021 in Sahiwal District.

However, deploying deep learning algorithms to characterize presentday, modern land cover based on state-of-the-art data is insufficient for understanding trends in land cover change and identifying changes in and drivers of ecological and social variables of interest. These identifications require characterizing past land cover, for which imagery is often lower-quality. We applied a deep learning pipeline to classify land cover from historical, low-quality RGB aerial imagery, using a case study of Vancouver, Canada. We deployed an atrous convolutional neural network from DeepLabv3+ (which has previously shown to outperform other networks) and trained it on modern Maxar satellite imagery using a modern land cover classification. We fine-tuned the resultant model using a small dataset of manually annotated and augmented historical imagery. This final model accurately predicted historical land cover classification at rates similar to other studies that used high-quality imagery. These predictions indicate that Vancouver has lost vegetative cover from 1995-2021, including a decrease in conifer cover, an increase in pavement cover, and an overall decrease in tree and grass cover.

This study examined the status, trends, and driving factors of smallholder farmers' managed land use land cover (LULC) dynamics over the past 30 years (1988e2018) in two contrasting agro-ecological zones (AEZ) of highly-populated Southeastern escarpments of the Ethiopian Rift Valley. Changes in LULC were quantified by integrating field observation, remote-sensing data, and geographic information systems. Landsat images (1988, 2003, and 2018), household surveys (for drivers), and time-series data sources were used to generate the datasets. Results showed that: (1) the total area of 75,246.98 ha (33.79%) was non-linearly changed to various LULC classes. Cultivated land and agroforestry were dominant and increased in humid AEZ from 1988 to 2018. In the same period, waterbody, wetland/marshy, and grass/bushland were dominant and increased in semi-arid AEZ. Cultivated land increased remarkably at the expense of wetland/marshy, woodland, forestland, and grass/bushland in both humid and semi-arid AEZs, and, consequently, bare land was expanded by 1288% in the region. Agroforestry was highly persistent, while forestland was found to be highly susceptible to LULC change. (2) We observed that there was a spatial variation of drivers between humid and semi-arid AEZs. Population growth and landholding size (land fragmentation) were considered to be the main drivers of LULC changes in humid AEZ, while drought/rainfall variability and agricultural investment were the principal drivers in semi-arid AEZ. Ordinary least square (OLS) and binary logistic regression have also confirmed that population density and agricultural investment are the top drivers that significantly influence LULC classes. We conclude that unmanaged population growth, coupled with the continued expansion of cultivated land, have remarkably contributed to the expansion of bare land and decreases vegetation cover.

The results indicated that the random forest classification results for land use and cover in the Shiyang River Basin in 2015 outperformed the AGLC-2000-2015, GLC_FCS30, and CLCD datasets in both overall and partial validations. Moreover, the classification results in this study exhibited a high level of agreement with the ground truth features. From 1991 to 2020, the area of bare land exhibited a decreasing trend, with changes primarily occurring in the middle and lower reaches of the basin. The area of grassland initially decreased and then increased, with changes occurring mainly in the upper and middle reaches of the basin. In contrast, the area of cropland initially increased and then decreased, with changes occurring in the middle and lower reaches. The LUCC was influenced by both natural and anthropogenic factors. Climatic factors and population contributed significantly to LUCC, and the importance values of evapotranspiration, precipitation, temperature, and population were 22.12%, 32.41%, 21.89%, and 19.65%, respectively. Moreover, policy interventions also played an important role. Land use and cover in the Shiyang River Basin exhibited fluctuating changes over the past 30 years, with the ecological environment improving in the last 10 years. This suggests that governance efforts in the study area have had some effects, and the government can continue to move in this direction in the future. The findings can provide crucial insights for related research and regional sustainable development in the Shiyang River Basin and other similar arid and semi-arid areas.",land use and cover classification,land use and cover change (LUCC),climate change,random forest,accuracy assessment,three-dimensional sampling method,Shiyang River Basin,"Cheng, Jinquan","Zhao, Xuanru","Guan, Weijin","Pan, Baotian",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article aims to classify, map, and to characterize Land Systems (LS) at a global scale and analyze the spatial determinants of these systems. Besides proposing such a classification, the article tests if global assessments can be based on globally uniform allocation rules. Land cover, livestock, and agricultural intensity data are used to map LS using a hierarchical classification method. Logistic regressions are used to analyze variation in spatial determinants of LS. The analysis of the spatial determinants of LS indicates strong associations between LS and a range of socioeconomic and biophysical indicators of human-environment interactions. The set of identified spatial determinants of a LS differs among regions and scales, especially for (mosaic) cropland systems, grassland systems with livestock, and settlements. (Semi-)Natural LS have more similar spatial determinants across regions and scales. Using LS in global models is expected to result in a more accurate representation of land use capturing important aspects of land systems and land architecture: the variation in land cover and the link between land-use intensity and landscape composition. Because the set of most important spatial determinants of LS varies among regions and scales, land-change models that include the human drivers of land change are best parameterized at sub-global level, where similar biophysical, socioeconomic and cultural conditions prevail in the specific regions.",global,human-environment interactions,land cover,land system,land-change models,spatial determinants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to identify land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes and their drivers in a sub-Saharan dryland, between 1986 and 2017, by integrating local knowledge and remote sensing. Local knowledge and environmental perception are used as the basis for defining LULC classes and for training and validation of change detection. This study detects significant LULC changes in 41% of the investigated area, and identifies bush encroachment into former pastures as the dominant LULC change with an increase of woodland by 39% and a decrease of grassland by 74%. This process is perceived as severe degradation by local respondents and is linked to changing management regimes and unreliable rainfall patterns. Deforestation and woodland thinning account for 44% of the detected changes, and can be traced back to increased habitation and farming, although the local community also identifies charcoal production as a driving factor. The integration of remote sensing and local knowledge provides a holistic view on LULC change in Pokot Central, Kenya and offers a solid base for site-specific and actor-centred management approaches necessary for sustainable pathways of drylands.

For this purpose, a high-resolution mesoscale model, coupled with a land surface model and a hydrologic routing model, is integrated for five years in two experiments, one control without changes in land use and another changing land use annually. During the rainy season, simulated higher precipitation volumes are reduced with the expansion of pasture lands. In the dry periods, mainly in August, there is an increase in precipitation over some deforested areas, which can be associated with mesoscale circulations induced by the heterogeneous surface. In general, land-use changes reduce evapotranspiration and the net radiation at the surface and increase the sensible heat flux during the dry season. In the rainy period, there is an increase in evapotranspiration with the intensification of deforestation, which modifies the other components of energy balance. Results suggest that the impact of LUCC on the local climate is more affected by conditions that generate precipitation extremes (El Nino/La Nina events) than by the abrupt increase in the annual deforestation rate. Land-use changes reduce the streamflow in all sub-basins of Ji-Parana during the dry season.

In complex basins like the Indus Basin, water is utilized by different land cover and land uses. Up to date information about these Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classes provide essential information on the water flow path. Traditionally, landscapes are described by cover type. For water management analysis, the information on land use is vital. To this end, a classification of LULC in the Indus Basin (covering 116.2 million hectares of Pakistan, India, China and Afghanistan) has been made. Vegetation index images freely available from SPOT-Vegetation satellite were used to describe the phenological cycle of all agro-ecosystems at a spatial resolution of 1 km x 1 km. An unsupervised clustering technique was adapted to classify 27 land use classes. Ground information and expert knowledge on the growing patterns of crops was used to label the resulting LULC classes. This helped to discern specific crops and crop rotations. An error matrix was prepared using ground truthing data to evaluate the classification accuracy. Existing global, regional and local studies were also considered for validation. The results show an overall accuracy of 77%, with the producer's accuracy being 78% and user's accuracy 83%. The Kappa coefficient (0.73) shows moderate agreement between on ground and satellite derived map. This is deemed sufficient for supporting water management analysis. The availability of major crop rotation statistics and types of forests and savanna is key information for the input data in hydrological models and water accounting frameworks.

To identify the spatiotemporal change and the driving mechanism of land use at the regional scale is of great significance to environmental preservation and economic development in the whole locality. In order to analyze the spatiotemporal change of land cover in Fuxian Lake watershed for the last four decades, our paper extracted the information of land use and land cover in the area using the method of combining supervised classification with visual interpretation. The process of extraction referred to a total of 10 time series remote sensing images (namely the 1974, 1977, 1987, 1990, 1996, 2000, 2006, 2009, 2012, and 2014 phases) as the main data source, and drew on the achievement data from the China Geography Census as an ancillary source. Accordingly, we obtained the spatiotemporal characteristics of the land-cover type change in Fuxian Lake watershed for the last 40 years. Finally, based on the socioeconomic data in the locality, using principal component analysis and multiple regression analysis, this paper analyzed the driving forces of LUCC in the watershed to acquire the major driving force factors, and built up a corresponding multiple linear regression model. The same kind of model was established for the local cultivated land and its driving force factors. The result shows that:1) In terms of changing trends, along with the increasing human activities in the socioeconomic domain of the catchment, the last four decades has seen a mounting local number of gardens, building regions (districts), roads, structures, artificial piling and digging of land, as well as wastelands and bare surface. As a contrast, there has been a decreasing trend for cultivated land, woodland, grassland, and water for the same term.2) The variation degree of land cover was higher during the period 1990-96 and 2000-06, and was the lowest in 1974-77.3) During 1974-77, 1987-2000, 2006-14, and 1974-2014, there was a noticeable discrepancy between the converted areas of various land-use types, which was higher for woodland, grassland, and arable land, and was lower for water by comparison.4) The cultivated area in Fuxian Lake watershed was positively correlated with such factors as overall population, natural population growth rate, the production value of the primary industry, the production value of the tertiary industry, industrial production value, GDP, fiscal expenditure, living expenditure per capita, and annual average temperature. It was negatively correlated with some other factors, including agricultural population, agricultural production value, rural income per capita, total retail sales of consumer goods, grain total output, the per unit area yield of grain, the amount of fertilizer used in agriculture, the amount of pesticide used in agriculture, and annual average precipitation.",Fuxian lake watershed,land-use/land-cover change,spatiotemporal change,driving mechanism,,,,"Wang, Jin-Liang","Peng, Shuang-Yun",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet land-cover change is a complex phenomenon that not only involves habitat destruction but also forest recovery over different time scales. Therefore, we might expect species to respond in diverse ways with likely consequences for the reorganization of regional assemblages. These changes, however, may be different in tropical islands because of their low species richness, generalist habits and high proportion of endemics. Here, we focus on the island of Puerto Rico and ask how island-wide changes in land cover and land use has influenced the large-scale organization of bird assemblages. To address this question, we combined in a Geographical Information System (GIS) the first 6 years (1997-2002) of the Puerto Rican Breeding Bird Survey (PR-BBS) with land-cover and land-use data extracted from a published digital map derived from the classification of Landsat images. A Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMS) ordination based on the composition and abundance of birds, and percentage land-use types showed that land use followed by climate could explain most of the variation observed among routes in terms of species composition and abundance. Moreover, endemic and exotic species were widely distributed throughout the island, but the proportion of endemic species is higher in closed forests while exotic species are more abundant in open habitats. However, historical accounts from the early 1900s indicate that endemic species were distributed across the entire island. Today, most of the land cover transformation in Puerto Rico occurs in the lowlands which may explain the high abundance of endemic species in cloud forests and the high abundance of exotic species in open habitats in the lowlands.",biological invasions,bird assemblages,endemic species,land cover,land use,Puerto Rico,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding the process of land cover changes and transitions is essential for good ecosystem management policy that would lead to improved agricultural production, human well-being and ecosystems health. This study aimed to assess land cover transitions in a typical semi-arid degraded agro-ecosystems environment within the Pangani river basin in northern Tanzania. Three Landsat images spanning over 30years were used to detect random and systematic patterns of land cover transition in a landscape dominated by crop and livestock farming. Results revealed that current land cover transition is driven by a systematic process of change dominated by the following: (i) transition from degraded land to sparse bushland (108%); (ii) conversion from sparse bushland to dense bushland in lowland areas (60%); (iii) conversion from bushland to forest (48%); and (iv) conversion from dense bushland to cropland in the highlands (45%). Agricultural lands under water harvesting technology adoption show a high degree of persistence (60-80%) between time slices. This suggests that there is a trend in land-use change towards vegetation improvement in the catchment with a continuous increase in the adoption of water harvesting technologies for crop and livestock farming. This can be interpreted as a sign of agricultural intensification and vegetation regrowth in the catchment.

Although there is a growing interest in evaluating the effect of land use/-cover change on mountain hydrology, quantitative assessments of the impact of land use/-cover on hydrological processes are hampered by the lack of field measurements characterizing runoff generation processes. In this paper, we present results from field experiments of rainfall runoff mechanisms in the southern Ecuadorian Andes. A rainfall simulator was used to quantify the hydrological response of distinct land use/-cover types to intense rainfall (about 40 mm/h). The rainfall runoff experiments indicate that degraded and abandoned land generate surface runoff within a few minutes after the start of the rainfall event. These lands have a very rapid and sharp hillslope hydrological response, as Hortonian overland flow is the dominant runoff generation mechanism. In contrast, surface runoff on arable and rangelands is rare, as their soils are characterized by a high infiltration capacity (i.e. >29 mm/h). Our experiments provide evidence that runoff generation in degraded Andean ecosystems is mainly controlled by the surface vegetation cover and land management. When reducing the surface vegetation cover, the soil is increasingly affected by rapid hillslope runoff as the presence of large amounts of smectites in the outcropping soft rocks makes the material very prone to sealing and crusting, thereby enhancing runoff generation.

The Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau (GHKM) region located in South China has undergone rapid economic development and urbanization over the past three decades (1986-2017). Therefore, this study investigates the changes in LULC of GHKM based on multi-year Landsat and nighttime light (NTL) data. First, a supervised classification technique, i.e., support vector machine (SVM), is used to classify the Landsat images into seven thematic classes: forest, grassland, water, fishponds, built-up, bareland, and farmland. Second, the demographic activities are studied by calculating the light index, using nighttime light data. Third, several socioeconomic factors, derived from statistical yearbooks, are used to determine the impact on the LULCC in the study area. The post-classification change detection shows that the increase in the urban area, from 0.76% (1488.35 km(2)) in 1986 to 10.31% (20,643.28 km(2)) in 2017, caused GHKM to become the largest economic segment in South China. This unprecedented urbanization and industrialization resulted in a substantial reduction in both farmland (from 53.54% (105,123.93 km(2)) to 33.07% (64,932.19 km(2))) and fishponds (from 1.25% (2463.35 km(2)) to 0.85% (1674.61 km(2))) during 1986-2017. The most dominant conversion, however, was of farmland to built-up area. The subsequent urban growth is also reflected in the increasing light index trends revealed by NTL data. Of further interest is that the overall forest cover increased from 33.24% (65,257.55 km(2)) to 45.02% (88,384.19 km(2)) during the study period, with a significant proportion of farmland transformed into forest as a result of different afforestation programs. An analysis of the socioeconomic indicators shows that the increase in gross domestic product, total investment in real estate, and total sales of consumer goods, combined with the overall industrialization, have led to (1) urbanization on a large scale, (2) an increased light index, and (3) the reduction of farmland. The speed of development suggests that opportunistic development has taken place, which requires a pressing need to improve land policies and regulations for more sustainable urban development and protection of farmland.",land use land cover,light index,Landsat,nighttime light data,,,,"Abbas, Sawaid",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LU/LC change is a critical factor that directly impacts watershed hydrology. The study intends to assess the LU/LC dynamics and their impacts on the streamflow of the Tikur Wuha watershed (TWW) in Ethiopia. LU/LC change was assessed using Landsat images. Each image is classified using a maximum likelihood algorithm of the supervised classification method. The Soil and Water Assessment Tools (SWAT) model were used to examine the impact of LU/LC change on streamflow. The overall accuracy of the LU/LC maps ranged from 77.50 to 87.33%. The findings demonstrated an increase in built-up and cultivated areas and a decrease in shrubland, grassland, swampy areas, and water bodies. The calibration and validation results showed a reasonable performance rate of the SWAT model. The LU/LC changes, which occurred between 1978 and 2017, had increased the average annual streamflow by 8.12%, 9.78%, and 14.77% between 1978 and1988, 1978 and 1998, 1978 and 2017. The Kiremt season flow increased by 9.80% during the first half of the study period (1978-1998) and by 5.41% in the second half (1998-2017). It is risen by 15.74% in 2017 compared to in 1978. The observed changes in the streamflow have resulted from LU/LC changes in the TWW.

However, its impact on the local environment and land use/land cover (LULC) dynamics was not well investigated in Guba District, northwest Ethiopia. This study aimed to examine the implications of LSCAI projects on LULC change dynamics. To achieve this, the study employed a concurrent triangulation design, combining of qualitative and quantitative data. Data for the study were collected from primary and secondary sources, including satellite images with ground verification. The LULC map was prepared and image classification conducted by employing Arc GIS10.5 and ERDAS 2014. Structured interviews were conducted with 351 households, and unstructured in-depth interviews were conducted with key informants. The study revealed a significant increase in LULC over time. Dense forest cover decreased by 0.61% and open woodlands decreased by 1.25% per year. In contrast, cropland expanded by 1.79% per year between 1990 and 2019. Particularly, between 2010 and 2019, the rate of cropland expansion reached 3.25% per year due to the influx of LSCAI projects. This indicates that the expansion of LSCAI projects has nearly doubled the rate of LULC change in the study area. During the key informant interviews, it was confirmed that the period from 2010 to 2019 witnessed substantial expansion of LSCAI projects in the study area. Local communities also expressed concerns about the potential threats posed by LSCAI, including deforestation, land dispossession, malpractices, violent conflicts, and increased charcoal production. The main drivers of severe LULC are anthropogenic factors that promote the expansion of LSCAI. It is recommended that in the process of LSCAI, land identification and transfer to developers should be done in consultation with local communities, and the policy direction on natural resource utilization should be revisited to ensure the most sustainable use of land resources.",Land use,land cover,Large-scale commercial agricultural investment,Northwest Ethiopia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The R commands provided make the time-consuming process of extracting data for specific places much more accessible. As a result, a statistical study of LST over Bali is shown as an example. Over the 15 regions of Bali, a quadratic polynomial identified five possible warming patterns, while a logistic regression model assessed the probability of warming. The findings suggest that 25.2% of Bali has warmed during the last two decades, with temperatures being highest in urban and built-up areas and deciduous forests and inversely associated with elevation. Global warming has sparked a lot of academic interest and has become a serious climate problem.

The classifier is trained on a stratified random sample of 20,000 hand-labeled 5 x 5 km Sentinel 2 tiles spanning 14 biomes globally. Since the training data are based on visual interpretation of image composites by both expert and non-expert annotators, without explicit spectral properties specified in the class definitions, the spectral characteristics of the classes are not obvious. The objective of this study is to quantify the physical distinctions among the land cover classes by characterizing the spectral properties of the range of reflectance present within each of the Dynamic World classes over a variety of landscapes. This is achieved by comparing both the eight-class probability feature space (excluding snow) and the maximum probability class assignment (label) distributions to continuous land cover fraction estimates derived from a globally standardized spectral mixture model. Standardized substrate, vegetation, and dark (SVD) endmembers are used to unmix nine Sentinel 2 reflectance tiles from nine spectral diversity hotspots for comparison between the SVD land cover fraction continua and the Dynamic World class probability continua and class assignments. The variance partition for the class probability feature spaces indicates that eight of these nine hotspots are effectively five-dimensional to 95% of variance. Class probability feature spaces of the hotspots all show a tetrahedral form with probability continua spanning multiple classes. Comparison of SVD land cover fraction distributions with maximum probability class assignments (labels) and probability feature space distributions reveal a clear distinction between (1) physically and spectrally heterogeneous biomes characterized by continuous gradations in vegetation density, substrate albedo, and structural shadow fractions, and (2) more homogeneous biomes characterized by closed canopy vegetation (forest) or negligible vegetation cover (e.g., desert, water). Due to the ubiquity of spectrally heterogeneous biomes worldwide, the class probability feature space adds considerable value to the Dynamic World maximum probability class labels by offering users the opportunity to depict inherently gradational heterogeneous landscapes otherwise not generally offered with other discrete thematic classifications.",Sentinel-2,Dynamic World,land cover classification,deep learning,spectral mixture model,characterization,feature space,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,spectral dimensionality,,,,,,,,,,,

The multi-classification map is expected to improve the performance of individual classifications by reconciling their best characteristics while avoiding their main weaknesses. The intermap comparison reveals improved agreement of the hybrid map with all other land-cover products and therefore indicates the successful exploration of synergies between the different products. The approach offers also estimates for the classification confidence associated with the pixel label and flexibility to shift the balance between commission and omission errors, which are critical in order to obtain a desired reliable map.

Although previous studies have investigated the impacts of land cover land use (LULC) and other factors on the urban land surface temperature (LST), the results of such studies are mixed. For instance, it is not yet clear what factors affect the spatial and temporal variation of the relationship between LULC and the LST, as well as the exact trajectory through which identified factors affect the thermal character of the urban landscape. In the current study, we examined the relationship between LULC, elevation and LST in Ilorin from the period of 2002-2020. The overriding aim was to understand the degree of association between LULC, elevation and LST, and the drivers of the spatial and temporal variation in the observed relationship. LST and NDVI were derived from Landsat data products. LST was derived using a mono window algorithm and NDVI was used as proxy for LULC. The spatial pattern of LULC was analyzed using Moran's I spatial autocorrelation statistics. To investigate the relationship between LULC, elevation and LST, we adopted both ordinary least square (OLS) regression models and the geographically weighted regression (GWR) method to reveal both the linear and the geographically varying relationship between the LULC, elevation and LST. The results of the study show that the LULC pattern of Ilorin has been significantly altered during the 2000 to 2020 period. The urban proportion of the landscape has shown a significant increase, rising by more than 11% relative to 2002 figures, and the vegetation proportion, especially the forest component, has diminished within same temporal extent. LST values varied in both space and time, with high temperature clusters noticeable in the built-up areas and decreasing towards the urban periphery. The result of the autocorrelation analysis using Moran's I index reveals a significant clustering of LST in all the epochs investigated. Across the study area, minimum and maximum LST values of 0 ?? and 41 ? were recorded in 2002 and 2020 respectively. Statistically significant relationships were observed between LULC, elevation and LST. However, the relationship between elevation and LST was very weak. Temporally, the strength of the relationship between the variables (as indicated in the variables' coefficient) as well as the overall model predictive performance (indicated by in the R-2) fluctuated over the years. Spatially, the strength of relationship between LST and LULC and elevation varied significantly. LULC explained approximately between 26% and 64% of total LST variation in the city between 2002 and 2020. The study findings are relevant for efforts geared towards alleviating the degree of UHI or its impacts, generally, and in the city of Ilorin, in particular. An understanding of the spatial distribution of LULC and their impacts on the LST can be helpful in identifying areas needing attention. The observed relationship between relevant LULC classes can be incorporated into urban planning strategies to ensure a sustainable city development.",Land use,Land cover,Land surface temperature,Urban heat island,Urbanization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is especially the case for regions dependent on limited local groundwater supplies. For the groundwater dependent Central Coast of California, we developed two scenarios of future land use and water demand based on sampling from a historical land change record: a business-as-usual scenario (BAU; 1992-2016) and a recent-modern scenario (RM; 2002-2016). We modeled the scenarios in the stochastic, empirically based, spatially explicit LUCAS state-and-transition simulation model at a high resolution (270-m) for the years 2001-2100 across 10 Monte Carlo simulations, applying current land zoning restrictions. Under the BAU scenario, regional water demand increased by an estimated similar to 222.7 Mm(3) by 2100, driven by the continuation of perennial cropland expansion as well as higher than modern urbanization rates. Since 2000, mandates have been in place restricting new development unless adequate water resources could be identified. Despite these restrictions, water demand dramatically increased in the RM scenario by 310.6 Mm(3) by century's end, driven by the projected continuation of dramatic orchard and vineyard expansion trends. Overall, increased perennial cropland leads to a near doubling to tripling perennial water demand by 2100.

The mixed land use watershed displayed a synchronized runoff response to monsoon rains. Measured runoff and sediment yield varied one sub-watershed to another and ranged, respectively, from 256.33 to 367.83 mm and from 0.27 to 11.65 t/ha for 734.90 mm of rainfall in 2000 and from 310.36 to 393.49 mm and from 0.84 to 10.71 t/ha for 765.50 mm of rainfall in 2001.

As a terrain with land with high- quality soils, it was one of the main areas of agricultural production in the past.

The review summarizes recent estimates on changes in cropland, agricultural intensification, tropical deforestation, pasture expansion, and urbanization and identifies the still unmeasured land-cover changes. Climate-driven land-cover modifications interact with land-use changes. Land-use change is driven by synergetic factor combinations of resource scarcity leading to an increase in the pressure of production on resources, changing opportunities created by markets, outside policy intervention, loss of adaptive capacity, and changes in social organization and attitudes. The changes in ecosystem goods and services that result from land-use change feed back on the drivers of land-use change. A restricted set of dominant pathways of land-use change is identified. Land-use change can be understood using the concepts of complex adaptive systems and transitions. Integrated, place-based research on land-use/land-cover change requires a combination of the agent-based systems and narrative perspectives of understanding.

In this context, this study aimed to analyze the dynamics of LULC and its impact on the spatiotemporal variation of the LST in the two largest urban cities in Syria, Damascus, and Aleppo. To achieve this, LULC changes, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and LST were calculated from multi-temporal Landsat data for the period 2010 to 2018. The study revealed significant changes in LULC, which were represented by a decrease in agricultural land and green areas and an increase in bare areas in both cities. In addition, built-up areas decreased in Aleppo and increased in Damascus during the study period. The temporal and spatial variation of the LST and its distribution pattern was closely related to the effect of changes in LULC as well as to land use conditions in each city. This effect was greater in Aleppo than in Damascus, where Aleppo recorded a higher increase in the mean LST, by about 2 degrees C, than in Damascus, where it was associated with greater degradation and loss of vegetation cover. In general, there was an increasing trend in the minimum and maximum LST as well as an increasing trend in the mean LST in both cities. The negative linear relationship between LST and NDVI confirms that vegetation cover can help reduce LST in both cities. This study can draw the attention of relevant departments to pay more attention to mitigating the negative impact of LULC changes in order to limit the increase in LST.",land use and land cover change (LULC),land surface temperature (LST),normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI),Landsat,Damascus,Aleppo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The five criteria, such as DEM, slope, aspect, distance from the road, and distance from builtup, are used as spatial variable maps in the processes of learning in MLP-ANN to predict their influences on LULC between 2005 and 2010. It was found that DEM, distance from the road, and distance from the builtup have significant effects. The projected and accurate LULC maps for 2015 indicate a good level of accuracy, with an overall Kappa value of 0.69 and a percentage of the correctness of 76.28%. MLP-ANN is then used to forecast changes in LULC for the years 2025 and 2030, which shows a significant rise in cropland and builtup areas, by 20 km(2) and 10 km(2), respectively.

To mitigate wide-spread land degradation, actions have been taken to maintain and restore ecologically valuable landscapes such as natural forests. However, the effects of the various vegetation protection policies that have been implemented in China since the late 1990's still remain largely unknown. In this paper, we therefore focus on mapping land use and land cover change (LULCC) in Inner Mongolia, one of the key regions targeted by Chinese ecological restoration programs. We used 250-m MODIS time series and a random forest classification approach to generate annual probabilities for each land cover class between 2000 and 2014. We then applied a trajectory-based change detection approach based on a modified version of the Landsat-based detection of trends in disturbance and recovery (LandTrendr) algorithm to the probability time series and mapped land cover change trajectories. We found that our trajectory-based approach achieved high accuracies (overall accuracy 0.95 +/- 0.02). It provides spatial-temporal land change maps that allow a land-use related interpretation of change patterns. Our change maps show that i) forest loss decreased rapidly after 2000 (from 15,717 1770 ha in 2001 to 1313 165 ha in 2014) and forth gain (190,645 28,352 ha during 2001-2014) occurred in the ecological program zones, leading to a net forest increase in Inner Mongolia, and ii) cropland retirement (212,979 54,939 ha during 2001-2014) mostly occurred at the early stage of ecological programs and mainly concentrated in drier environments and steep terrain. Overall, land cover mapping and trajectory-based land use analyses allowed a consistent characterization of LULCC over large areas, which is crucial for gaining a better understanding of environmental changes in the light of rapidly changing environmental policies and governance regimes in China.",Land use and land cover change,Deforestation,Afforestation,Cropland retirement,MODIS time series,Trajectory-based approach,Inner Mongolia,"Li, Zhengguo","Hostert, Patrick",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Machine learning,Random forest,,,,,,Probability scores,,,,

The surface urban heat island (SUHI) phenomenon particularly constitutes a significant threat to human comfort and geo-environmental health in TMA. This study aimed to profile the spatial interconnections between land surface temperature (LST) and land cover/use in TMA from 2001 to 2015 using multi-source spatial data. To this end, the thermal gradients between the urban and non-urban fabric areas in TMA were examined by joint analysis of land cover/use and LST. The spatiotemporal aggregation patterns, variations, and movement trajectories of SUHI intensity in TMA were identified and delineated. The spatial relationship between SUHI and the potential driving forces in TMA was clarified using geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis. The results show that the thermal environment of TMA exhibited a polynucleated spatial structure with multiple thermal island cores. Overall, the magnitude and extent of SUHI in TMA increased and expanded from 2001 to 2015. During that time, SUHIs clustered in the compact residential quarters and redevelopment/renovation areas rather than downtown. The GWR models showed better performance than ordinary least squares (OLS) models, with Adj R-2 > 0.9, indicating that the magnitude of SUHI significantly depended on its neighboring geographical setting, including land cover composition and configuration, population size, and terrain. We suggest that UHI mitigation in Tokyo should be focused on alleviating the magnitude of persistent thermal cores and controlling unstable SUHI occurrence based on partitioned or location-specific landscape design.

The aim of this article is to assess if the data available in the collaborative project OpenStreetMap (OSM) may be used as a source of data to assist the creation of these reference databases, reducing the time spent and costs associated with their generation. For this aim, two case studies were used, where the validation of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security Urban Atlas (UA) was performed. The used methodology requires the harmonization of the data available in OSM with the UA nomenclature, and the subsequent creation of a LULC map from the OSM data. This map was then compared to UA to assess the similarity of the regions mapped in both. To test the usefulness of OSM data to assess the accuracy of UA, a sample of points was created and two reference databases generated, one assigning the data extracted automatically from OSM to the points where these data were available, and PI for the remaining points, and the other using only PI. The accuracy assessment of UA for the two case studies was then made building confusion matrixes and computing accuracy indicators. The results showed that for the two study areas, only low percentages of points had to be photo interpreted in the first reference database (respectively, 12% and 2% for the two study areas), decreasing the work load considerably. The results obtained with both reference databases are comparable for level 1 classes. For level 2 classes, worse results were obtained for some classes, showing that the OSM data used are not enough to create reliable reference data.",Land use/land cover,accuracy assessment,OpenStreetMap,reference data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This NDVI decrease continued for nearly 3 months before the onset of vegetation regrowth. Change in vegetation into other LCs over the landfall region resulted in an increase of the mean daytime land surface temperature by similar to 6 degrees C.

Much of the land use/cover change (LUCC) in this region is associated with the marginalization of traditional agricultural practices due to ongoing socioeconomic shifts and subsequent ecological change. Regression-based models of LUCC have two purposes: (i) to aid explanation of the processes driving change and/or (ii) spatial projection of the changes themselves. The independent variables contained in the single 'best' regression model (that is, that which minimizes variation in the dependent variable) cannot be inferred as providing the strongest causal relationship with the dependent variable. Here, we examine the utility of hierarchical partitioning and multinomial regression models for, respectively, explanation and prediction of LUCC in EU Special Protection Area 56, 'Encinares del rio Alberche y Cofio' (SPA 56) near Madrid, Spain. Hierarchical partitioning estimates the contribution of regression model variables, both independently and in conjunction with other variables in a model, to the total variance explained by that model and is a tool to isolate important causal variables. By using hierarchical partitioning we find that the combined effects of factors driving land cover transitions varies with land cover classification, with a coarser classification reducing explained variance in LUCC. We use multinomial logistic regression models solely for projecting change, finding that accuracies of maps produced vary by land cover classification and are influenced by differing spatial resolutions of socioeconomic and biophysical data. When examining LUCC in human-dominated landscapes such as those of the Mediterranean Basin, the availability and analysis of spatial data at scales that match causal processes is vital to the performance of the statistical modelling techniques used here.",land use/cover change,regression modelling,hierarchical partitioning,land cover classification,Spain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The simulation was carried out through the CLUE-S model (the Conversion of Land Use and its Effects at Small regional extent) using CORINE Land Cover (CLC) database and several biophysical and socio-economic explanatory variables associated with the current land use/cover pattern. Because of the political and socio-economic changes that took place after 1990 and their relevance for the resulted spatial transformations in land use/cover pattern, two scenarios based on the annual change rate of the 1990-2000 and 2000-2006 were used in order to explore potential future land use/cover changes. Thus, the predicted maps indicate significant changes in the agricultural land use pattern mainly in relation to the local-level conversion processes. Two change flows stand out, i.e. intensification and extensification of agriculture. The first flow is more likely to occur in the Banat and Criana Plains and Hills, the Transylvanian Tableland and west of the Romanian Plain, while the second will mainly occur in the Moldavian Plateau, the Dobrogea Plateau, the central part of the Romanian Plain and the Subcarpathians. Furthermore, a significant increase in the agricultural lands related to forest losses and decrease related to forest gains are expected in the plain regions, Transylvanian Tableland, Getic Piedmont, Moldavian Plateau and Subcarpathians. The results of the current research provide important information on the future spatial distribution of the agricultural land use classes in order to improve the general understanding on the causes and consequences of change.

The main objective of this study is to determine the effects of these land use land cover (LULC) transformations on regional meteorology over this region. Satellite derived LULC classes in 2003 and 2012 reveal conversion of significantly large areas of barrenland to open shrubland and open shrubland to cropland over Northwest India. Model simulations show that these LULC changes (LULCC) alone decreases sensible heat flux (SHF) over this region by -5.85 +/- 0.24Wm(-2) and enhances latent heat flux (LHF) by 11.03 +/- 0.41Wm(-2), with prominent changes over the exact regions of LULCC. These alterations lead to decrease in surface level air temperature by -0.14 +/- 0.005 K and increase in relative humidity by 1.48 +/- 0.03%. While reanalysis data show increase (decrease) in LHF (SHF) at a rate of 8.5Wm(-2)dec(-1) (-5.67Wm(-2)dec(-1)), satellite measurements show increasing trend in near surface relative humidity at a rate of 2.13%dec(-1) with an increasing trend in daily mean air temperature (0.3Kdec(-1)). However, day time air temperature and diurnal temperature range decreases at rates of -0.007Kdec(-1) and -0.6Kdec(-1) respectively. To delineate the contribution of LULCC from the measured trend of daily mean temperatures, Observation Minus Reanalysis (OMR) method has been employed. OMR analysis shows a decreasing trend in daily mean temperature (-0.48Kdec(-1)) and increasing trend in RH (6.85% dec(-1)), corroborating the model simulated changes. The study shows increase in vegetated area over Northwest India, which leads to increase in evapo-transpiration. This affects the regional meteorology by enhancing humidity and SHF and reducing LHF and temperature. These results demonstrate that the land-based mitigation strategies yield measurable climatic benefits over the period of one or two decades, in contrast to the much longer time period generally required for greenhouse gases to cycle through the climate system.

This method updates NLCD 2001 to a nominal date of 2006 by using both Landsat imagery and data from NLCD 2001 as the baseline. Pairs of Landsat scenes in the same season in 2001 and 2006 were acquired according to satellite paths and rows and normalized to allow calculation of change vectors between the two dates. Conservative thresholds based on Anderson Level I land cover classes were used to segregate the change vectors and determine areas of change and no-change. Once change areas had been identified, land cover classifications at the full NLCD resolution for 2006 areas of change were completed by sampling from NLCD 2001 in unchanged areas. Methods were developed and tested across five Landsat path/row study sites that contain several metropolitan areas including Seattle, Washington; San Diego, California; Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Jackson, Mississippi: and Manchester, New Hampshire. Results from the five study areas show that the vast majority of land cover change was captured and updated with overall land cover classification accuracies of 78.32%, 87.5%, 88.57%. 78.36%, and 83.33% for these areas. The method optimizes mapping efficiency and has the potential to provide users a flexible method to generate updated land cover at national and regional scales by using NLCD 2001 as the baseline.

Overlay of the mapped land cover in ArcInfo showed that farmland and grassland decreased while water, built-up areas, and woodland increased. More than three-quarters of the detected changes occurred during 1990-1995. Farmland changed mainly to woodland, water, and built-up areas while woodland and grassland were converted chiefly to farmland. Spatially, the change from woodland to farmland adjoined the margin of natural forests while change in the opposite direction was restricted to the agropastoral west. Paradoxically, reclamation of grassland to farmland also took place in the agropastoral west. These conflicting changes were caused primarily by lack of stability and consistency in the government's land use policies. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This research extended the land-cover-change simulation model we previously developed to investigate: (1) the assumption of temporal independence between patterns of error in classified time-series imagery; and (2) the interaction of patterns of change and patterns of error in a post-classification change analysis. In this research, the thematic complexity of the classified land-cover maps was increased by increasing the number of simulated land-cover classes. Simulating maps with increased categorical resolution permitted the incorporation of: (1) higher-order, more complex spatial and temporal interactions between land-cover classes; and (2) patterns of error that better reproduce the complex error interactions that often occur in time-series classified imagery. The overall modeling framework was divided into two primary components: (1) generation of a map representing true change; and (2) generation of a suite of change maps that had been perturbed by specific patterns of error. All component maps in the model were produced using simulated annealing, which enabled us to create a series of map realizations with user-defined spatial and temporal patterns. Comparing the true map of change to the error-perturbed maps of change using accuracy assessment statistics showed that increasing the temporal dependence between classification errors did not improve the accuracy of resulting maps of change when the categorical scale of the land-cover classified maps was increased. The increased structural complexity within the time series of maps effectively inhibited the impact of temporal dependence. However, results demonstrated that there are interactions between patterns of error and patterns of change in a post-classification change analysis.

The mean LST varies seasonally from 12.84 degrees C in Udaipur to 26.18 degrees C in Jaipur in winter and summer. Analysis of UTC shows that autumn and winter seasons have better UTC than spring and summer seasons. RFR analysis shows a robust correlation (R2 > 0.85) between LULC and LST across all cities. Notably, built-up areas, open land, and vegetation cover exert the greatest influence on LST.

Traditionally, WUI maps rest on the measurement of the distances among human settlements and wildlands. This methodology is effective to produce detailed maps and to give precise indications, but it is rigid and needs to pre-define fixed parameters. To overcome this uncertainty, we introduce a LULCC simulation model based on Machine Learning approach, allowing to produce prediction maps for the land cover classes related to the WUI. Finally, Fuzzy Set Theory is used to develop continuous non-categorical maps expressing the possibility of being part of this interface. The proposed methodology has been applied to the case study of Portugal, and considers the land covers referred to different epochs (1990, 2000, and 2012).

Consequently, the land surface temperature (LST) is continuously increasing and gradually intensifying the effects of the urban heat island. The aim of this study is to assess the spatiotemporal variation of LST in response to land use land cover change (LULC) during 1995-2020. The maximum likelihood classifier was used for the supervised classification of LULC and the accuracy assessment was done using the confusion matrix. Quin's Mono-window algorithms for Landsat TM data of 1995 and 2010 and split-window algorithms for Landsat 8 OLI data of 2020 were applied to retrieve LST. Several spectral indices such as Normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and Modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) were calibrated and pixel-specific overlay analysis was done for correlation study between spectral indices and LST. This work revealed that the rapid urban sprawling causes massive land transformation in the study area. The land conversions from trees outside forests (TOF) and agricultural land to built-up were significantly contributing to an overall increase in the mean LST during 1995-2020.

This region experienced rapid land use/land cover (LULC) shifts and climate change in the past decades. The effects of these changes on SOC sequestration are unknown. The objectives of this study were to 1) investigate the change in SOC stocks in Florida to determine if soils have acted as a net sink or net source for carbon (C) over the past four decades and 2) identify the concomitant effects of LULC, LULC change, and climate on the SOC change. A total of 1080 sites were sampled in the topsoil (0-20 cm) between 2008 and 2009 representing the current SOC stocks, 194 of which were selected to collocate with historical sites (n = 1251) from the Florida Soil Characterization Database (1965-1996) for direct comparison. Results show that SOC stocks significantly differed among LULC classes - sugarcane and wetland contained the highest SOC, followed by improved pasture, urban, mesic upland forest, rangeland, and pineland while crop, citrus and xeric upland forest remained the lowest. The surface 20 cm soils acted as a net sink for C with the median SOC significantly increasing from 2.69 to 3.40 kg m(-2) over the past decades. The SOC sequestration rate was LULC dependent and controlled by climate factors interacting with LULC. Higher temperature tended to accelerate SOC accumulation, while higher precipitation reduced the SOC sequestration rate. Land use/land cover change observed over the past four decades also favored the C sequestration in soils due to the increase in the C-rich wetland area by similar to 140% and decrease in the C-poor agricultural area by similar to 20%.

Specifically, we a) conducted a comprehensive analysis on the feature selection and parameter setting for largearea classification processes for 2.5-m historical panchromatic Corona imagery for a full suite of land cover classes, b) compared the pixel-based and object-oriented methods of classifying the land cover, and c) examined the benefits of adding a digital elevation model for the pixel-based and object-oriented land cover classifications. We mapped land cover in parts of the Caucasus Mountains (158,000 km2), a study area with great variability in land cover types and illumination conditions.

Currently changes in LULC and variations in SOC often are studied and modeled separately. However, both are conjoined and should be seen as part of a cascading ecosystem framework. This is not only true for SOC but also for other biophysical parameters which are governed by human activities. At a watershed scale, this relationship is exceptionally important and the focus should be towards studying the impact of LULC change on the levels of SOC in spatially explicit terms. To advance knowledge on this front, we studied transformations of LULC, erosion and SOC from the start of settled agriculture in a moderate size basin of similar to 9340 ha in Union and Pulaski Counties of Southern Illinois. The primary objective of this research was to study the evolution of SOC at the regional scale, as a result of historical land use change and erosion from 1851 to 2005. To model SOC, we used CENTURY 4.0 whereas LULC changes in the area were derived by visually classifying aerial photographs. Long-term erosion associated with different LULC was computed through Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). To simplify the task of carrying out numerous simulations (>5000), the study area was divided into cells of 100 m x 100 m. Since CENTURY is only vertically spatially explicit, each of these cells was designated as individual locations homogeneous with respect to different input and output parameters like SOC, erosion and LULC. Validation in the study was performed by aggregating and comparing CENTURY derived output with SOC estimates given in the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) Soil Survey Geographic Database for the year 2000. Our results show a correlation of 0.63 between the simulated and observed SOC estimates. In the study area, approximately 64% of SOC has been lost since the establishment of European-American settlements. Losses are considerable for the soil types which had higher initial levels of SOC. However, from the beginning of 1980, the simulations indicate rising carbon sequestration due to conservational management practices. This assessment is common across all LULC classes considered here. Though comparatively, rates of recovery of lost SOC are higher for areas which converted from agriculture to forest.

Transitions between five major land classes were identified in order to understand the trajectory of observed changes. In terms of gains, the forest class, the urban built-up and bare land class increased by 9% and 4% respectively over the study period. The gains of forest were mainly derived from the afforestation of some agricultural lands in the southern part, whereas the gains of built-up and bare lands were mostly from cultivated land which was a net losing class. Forest increase is in line with government's policy to increase the national forest cover to 30% by 2020. Forest losses occurred mostly outside protected areas due to land conversion for settlement and agricultural purposes. Much needed information about changes in LULC over the last three decades is provided. This study demonstrates in a timely manner how to analyse and monitor LULC change and the drivers in an environment where field based research is a challenge due to the mountainous terrain. The ecological richness of the region, which coincides with heightened human population pressure, necessitates the monitoring of land change as input for improving land use planning with focus on conserving biodiversity.

These rapid land demands increased the pressure on the country area to rebuild urban centers and cities surrounding the coast. The purpose of this research is to detect and investigate changes in land use and land cover (LULC), which is one of the most critical aspects of planning and managing the use of land as a natural resource. The massive growth in land demand, particularly in small-area countries like Bahrain, forces decision-makers to re-plan the main island areas (Bahrain, Muharraq, Sitra, and Nabih Saleh). The study focuses on mapping the LULC changes detection over 1986-2020. It employs an integrated approach of remote sensing and GIS (Geographic Information System) to analyze and evaluate the changes in the LULC area in the main islands using multi-temporal and multispectral Landsat satellite imagery acquired in 1986, 1994, 2000, 2005, 2013, and 2020.

Furthermore, different ancillary data were utilized to adjust the decision of LULC classes. The images were supervised using Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) algorithms to generate the seven LULC maps. The seven-raster classification maps revealed overall accuracies exceeding 85%, and overall Kappa statistics range between 87 and 95%.

Yet recent research increasingly acknowledges that villagers do not necessarily enlarge their fields as a response to increased food requirements. This paper suggests that drivers such as population growth should be connected to land cover changes by taking villagers' individual land use decisions into account. The links between drivers, individual land use decisions and land cover changes are explored in a small village in northern Burkina Faso, Yomboli, for the period 1956-2010. The analysis is based on measurements of the cultivated area, participant observation, interviews and questionnaires. Three waves of land cover changes are identified: field expansion between 1956 and 1991; field contraction from 1991 to 1995; and field expansion and contraction between 1995 and 2010. The results show shifting links between drivers, individual land use decisions and land cover outcomes throughout the period. The paper argues that villagers' earlier decisions on field enlargement have primarily been propelled by the driver of population growth, whilst recent decisions seem to be more influenced by individual rationales than general drivers of change. Moreover, the results show that villagers' decisions on field size are not solely economic judgements of cost and benefit. Rather, their decisions are anchored in three broad categories of rationality: economic, ecological and sociocultural rationality. This does not imply that villagers are economically ignorant, but that the concept of rationality assumes different meanings in a Sahelian context. The findings demonstrate as well the shifting influence of these rationalities as economic rationality has been replaced by sociocultural rationality over the last decade. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Currently, the literature is debating whether humans are leaving a topographic signature on the landscape. Apart from the influence of humans on processes, does the resulting landscape bear an unmistakable signature of anthropogenic activities? This research analyses from a statistical point of view the morphological signature of anthropogenic and natural land covers in different topographic context, as a fundamental challenge in the emerging debate of human-environment relationships and the modelling of global environmental change. It aims to explore how intrinsically small-scale processes, related to land use, can influence the form of entire landscapes and to determine whether these processes create a distinctive topography. The work focusses on four study areas in floodplains, plain to hilly, hills and mountains, for which LiDAR-derived Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) are available. Surface morphology is described with different geomorphometric parameters (slope, mean curvature and surface peak curvature) and their frequency distribution. The results show that the distribution of geomorphometric indices can reveal anthropogenic land covers and landscapes. In most cases, different land covers show statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) in their morphology. Finally, this study demonstrates the possibility to use a geomorphic analysis to quantify anthropogenic impact based on land covers in different landscape contexts. This provides useful insight into understanding the impact of human activities on the present morphology and offers a comprehensive understanding of coupling human-land interaction from a geomorphological point of view.",Geomorphology,Geomorphometry,Anthropogenic impact,Land cover,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is, however, very difficult to automatically extract detailed urban LULC information from remote sensing imagery, especially for a large urban area. Medium resolution imagery, such as Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data, cannot uncover detailed LULC information. Further, very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery, such as IKONOS and QuickBird data, can only be applied to a small area, largely due to the data unavailability and high computation cost. As a result, little research has been conducted to extract detailed urban LULC information for a large urban area. This study, therefore, developed a three-layer classification scheme for deriving detailedurban LULC information by integrating newly launched Chinese GF-1 (medium resolution) and GF-2 (very high resolution) satellite imagery and synthetically incorporating geometry, texture, and spectral information through multi-resolution image segmentation and object-based image classification (OBIA). Homogeneous urban LULC types such as water bodies or large areas of vegetation could be derived from GF-1 imagery with 16 m and 8 m spatial resolutions, while heterogeneous urban LULC types such as industrial buildings, residential buildings, and roads could be extracted from GF-2 imagery with 3.2 m and 0.8 m spatial resolutions. The multi-resolution segmentation method and a random forest algorithm were employed to perform image segmentation and object-based image classification, respectively. An analysis of the results suggests an overall accuracy of 0.89 and 0.87 were achieved for the second and third level urban LULC classification maps, respectively.

Land use and land cover (LULC) changes are largely responsible for soil erosion severity. This study aimed to evaluate the impacts of LULC on soil erosion and erosion distribution in the Laonung watershed over the study period (1995-2016). To model the response of soil erosion to LULC changes, a physiographic soil erosion-deposition (PSED) model is employed, which incorporates Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with rain-runoff models and erosion-deposition models. The results revealed that over a three period (1995, 2008 and 2011), agricultural land, grassland, bare land, water bodies, and other land uses increased, whereas forest land declined by 11,424 x 104 m2 (2008 relative to 1995) and 16,159 x 104 m2 (2011 relative to 1995). In addition to the land use, landslide was considered as a land cover in this study. As landslides dramatically alter the land cover dynamics of mountainous regions in Taiwan. The landslide areas substantial changed over the period 2003 to 2016 (847 x 104 m2-9474 x 104 m2). The significant increase in landslide area together with the abrupt dynamics in LU severely aggravated soil erosion.

This research adopted a land-use change analysis using GIS to evaluate the influence of the inducted slopeland-use policy on the slopeland-use change in Veterans Affairs Council (VAC) farms. Taiwan's slopeland-use policies included Veteran Agricultural Reclamation Policy (VARP) (1955-1988), Farmland Release Policy (FRP) (1989-2004), and National Land Restoration Policy (NLRP) (2005-2015). The results showed that VARP quickly changed 21.15 % forestland into farmland to obtain economic benefits and cause potential negative environmental impacts through veterans' migration. The potential labor and population migration should be considered on public policy decision-making for avoiding forestland-use change. The 7.36 % public farmland and 0.72 % private farmland changed into forestland in FRP. The 27.33 % public farmland and 3.53 % private farmland changed into forestland in NLRP. FRP changed public farmland into private farmland and obstructed afforestation. NLRP had a strong regulatory power for afforestation and potential ecological benefits with farmland reduction in public land. The effect of restoration policy was obstructed by private farmland. The potential land privatization should be taken into account for the efficacy of afforestation and conservation policy. This study also found critical information. The ecotourism and nonecotourism strategies produced different slopeland-use changes and potential impacts. Ecotourism strategy increased 29.19 % and 9.72 % public forestland in two farm cases and reduced potential negative environmental impacts.

Senegal has been a hotspot of change where agricultural activity has rapidly increased. Agriculture in this region is often a complex mosaic of small fields which makes them difficult to classify using conventional land cover mapping methods and coarse-resolution satellite imagery. WorldView (WV) satellites provide very high-resolution imagery that is ideal for semantic segmentation using convolutional neural networks (CNN). In this study, we introduced training strategies that scale up the training data for the U-Net model using 2 m WV-2 and 3 imagery to overcome the challenges of regional mapping with a patchwork of hundreds of images. The proposed strategies increased the number of training data for the U-Net model in three main scenarios, (i) conventional training, (ii) model transfer, and (iii) transfer learning, and we evaluated model generalizability on test sets for two different regions in Senegal.

The aim of this research was to quantify the effects of land-use/land-cover (LU/LC) changes on urban land surface temperature (LST) during a 25-year period (1993-2018) for the semiarid Shiraz City in southern Iran using Landsat data (TM, ETM+, and OLI/TIRS) and machine learning algorithms. Five main LU/LC classes, such as orchard, vegetation, bare surface, asphalt cover, and built-up areas, were identified using a support vector machine algorithm. Landsat images were used to retrieve normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI). The results showed that the mean LST over the entire study domain increased considerably between 1993 and 2018, due to urbanization, decrease of green areas, and increasing industrial areas. Built-up areas increased considerably by 25.8% from 80 to 100.6 km(2)between 1993 and 2018, while vegetation cover decreased dramatically by 69.3%.

Other states of protection like the UNESCO world heritage sites, for example, are created for maintaining culturally important places or lifestyles. In the Matobo Hills (Zimbabwe) both states of protection are present, a national park and a world heritage site. In addition, the land outside the National Park belongs to two different systems of ownership, namely ""common"" (i.e. community-owned) and ""not-common"" (privately or governmentally owned) land.In this paper, we investigated how the state of protection and the ownership affected the land use and land cover. We derived maps using Landsat images from 1989, 1998 and 2014 by supervised classification with Random Forests. To compensate for the lack of ground data we inferred past land use and land cover from recent observations combining photographs, Google Earth images and change detection. We could identify four classes, namely shrub land, forest, patchy vegetation and agricultural area.The Matobo National Park showed a stable composition of land cover during the study period and the main changes were observable in the surroundings. Outside the national park, forest increased by about 7%. The common lands have changed substantially and their agricultural area decreased. We attribute this development to the Fast Track Land Reform, which took place in the early 2000s. Our approach shows that combining information on recent land cover with change detection allows to study the, temporal development of protected areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Majuli Island is located in the upper reach of the Brahmaputra River in India. It is continuously changing its shape by the action of erosion of the Brahmaputra River, incurring both tangible and intangible losses. This study aims to find out the changes that occurred in the island by analyzing the land use/land cover along with channel migration in the Brahmaputra River that occurred in that area over the period 1973 to 2019.

Although the climatic effects of LCC have been investigated extensively, little is currently known about the effects of LUIC. In this study, we assess land use and cover change in China over the last three decades in terms of LCC and LUIC and investigate their climatic effects using the observation minus reanalysis method. Results indicate that nearly half of the stations have experienced LUIC, and the climatic response of these stations exhibit different or even opposite signals compared to those that have experienced LCC. With regard to LCC, it is found that urbanized stations generally exert a warming effect on local temperatures, whereas cropland expansion is likely to introduce a cooling effect. In the case of LUIC, the present study demonstrates that the intensification of grassland tends to lead to warming because of the decreased albedo. However, a cooling effect from the enhanced evapotranspiration (ET) dominates local temperature variations in intensified cropland stations. The absence of correlations between albedo/ET and land management changes in urban stations illustrates the inherent complexity of local climate change.

Current extents, rates and intensities of LULC changes are driving unprecedented changes in ecosystems functions and environmental processes at local, regional and global scales. The study was conducted to assess LULC changes and its drivers using remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) in Gojeb River Catchment, Ethiopia. The satellite images at different reference years (1978, 1987, 2001 and 2015) were obtained from Landsat images. Supervised classification with maximum likelihood algorithm was applied for image processing and change analysis. The LULC classes identified were cropland, forestland, shrubland, swamp, and woodland. The study found that the catchment has undergone significant LULC changes. The major changes were expansion of cropland at the expense of other LULC classes at the rate of 29.56% in 1978, 38.91% in 1987, 46.62% in 2001 and 52.74% in 2015. It has gained about 160,736.08 ha with an annual average increment of 4,344.22 ha. Conversely, forestland has undergone reductions at an annual rate of 9,030.0 ha between 1978 and 1987. The conversions of other classes to cropland are mainly associated with more demand for crop production. On the other hand, the conversion of relevant part of forest land to other classes could be due to vegetation degradation. Hence, the conversion of forestland to other land use classes could be attributed to the highly demand of agricultural land, firewood, charcoal, timbers and housing materials. The major driving forces which should be considered in sustainable watershed management were population growth and government induced settlements. Provision of modern alternative sources of energy, agricultural inputs and promoting non-agricultural sectors are also other considerations for the community sustainable livelihood.

In addition, individual interviews with 51 randomly selected households, discussions with focus group and key informants, and field observations were also incorporated for the study. The image classification indicated four categories of LULC classes: Natural forest, eucalyptus plantations, cropland/settlements, and grasslands. Between 1975 and 2014, cropland/settlements and eucalyptus plantations considerably increased, whereas grassland cover drastically decreased. According to the results, the area under cropland/settlements and eucalyptus plantations increased by 62 and 335%, respectively, with 74% concomitant decrease in the area of grasslands in the same period. Survey results showed that deterioration of soil fertility (41.2%) followed by shortage of land (35.3%) is the major constraint for crop production for poor farmers in the study area. However, better-off farmers ranked deterioration of soil fertility (64.7%) followed by lack of credit (17.6%) as priority constraints for crop production.

However, these changes did not occur in Nan Province located in northern Thailand. Deforestation is expected to continue due to high demand for forest products and increased agribusiness. The objectives of this paper are (1) to predict land-use change in the province based on trends, market-based and conservation scenarios, (2) to quantify biodiversity, and (3) to identify biodiversity hotspots at greatest risk for future deforestation. This study used a dynamic land-use change model (Dyna-CLUE) to allocate aggregated land demand for three scenarios and employed FRAGSTATS to determine the spatial pattern of land-use change. In addition, the InVEST Global Biodiversity Assessment Model framework was used to estimate biodiversity expressed as the remaining mean species abundance (MSA) relative to their abundance in the pristine reference condition. Risk of deforestation and the MSA values were combined to determine biodiversity hotspots across the landscape at greatest risk.

This is due to the existence of high-level landscape heterogeneity and unavailability of good quality remotely sensed data. This study, the first of a kind, implemented a unique methodological approach to this challenge. Using freely available Landsat imagery, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)-based informative feature selection and Random Forest classification is used to elucidate spatio-temporal patterns of LULC across coastal areas over a 28-year period (1990-2017). We show that the XGBoost feature selection approach effectively addresses the issue of high landscape heterogeneity and spectral complexities in the image data, successfully augmenting the RF model performance (providing a mean user's accuracy > 0.82). Multi-temporal LULC maps reveal that Bangladesh's coastal areas experienced a net increase in agricultural land (5.44%), built-up (4.91%) and river (4.52%) areas over the past 28 years. While vegetation cover experienced a net decrease (8.26%), an increasing vegetation trend was observed in the years since 2000, primarily due to the Bangladesh government's afforestation initiatives across the southern coastal belts. These findings provide a comprehensive picture of coastal LULC patterns, which will be useful for policy makers and resource managers to incorporate into coastal land use and environmental management practices.

However, in the last years a significant increase in forest cover has been measured. These new patterns are independent from planned conservation strategies and appear to have a substantial impact on landscapes and biodiversity. We used three land-use/land-cover maps (from 1960 to 2000) covering the Italian peninsula to analyze the pattern of land-use/land-cover change. We measured an increase in forests, especially in mountains, an increase in artificial areas, especially in coastal zones, and a decrease in pastures. Intensively cultivated areas showed a limited decrease while extensively cultivated ones showed a marked decrease. In the same period mammal and bird species followed a similar pattern, with forest birds, ungulates and carnivores increasing, and typically Mediterranean species decreasing. We suggest that our results may provide important information, which could be useful for conservation planning in the entire Mediterranean hotspot. We suggest that an increasing conservation effort should be made to protect the Mediterranean-type forests and scrublands, as well as traditional agricultural practices.

Northwest Ethiopia. Landsat-5 images of 1987, 1999, and 2010. and the Landsat-8 image of 2018 were used as the sources of data. The land use/cover changes were calculated using a land-use transition matrix. Data generated from household surveys were presented using percentage values to identify the driving forces of land use/cover changes. The land surface temperature (LST) result was quantified using the respective index equation. Results indicated that wetland. forest, shrublands, and grasslands declined by 96.6%. 72%. 77.7%. and 89.4% respectively over the analysis period. The encroachment of cultivation and overgrazing to marginal lands, weak institutional arrangement, sedimentation. high drainage of wetlands for crop production. and recurrent drought were the major driving forces behind the land use/cover change. Within this effect s the average land surface temperature was increased by 11.5 degrees C, 3.22 degrees C. and 2.02 degrees C due to wetland loss. clearing of the forest, and decline of shrublands respectively for the last 31 years. LSTs had correspondingly decreased by 5.42 degrees C and 3.77 degrees C on the afforested barren surfaces and planted shrublands. Hence. there should be an improved institutional arrangement for managing open access resources through the participation of local people in the management for minimizing the increase of land surface temperature in the study watershed.

Aerial photographs have high spatial resolution but provide lower spectral resolution than satellite data. While most land use/cover change studies compare changes from different spatial scales, this study applied land use/cover classification techniques to bring the data to a relatively similar scale. The data revealed that woody vegetation decreased from 5,576 ha to 3,012 ha from the 1950s to 2010. Most of the deforestation took place between the 1970s and 1980s, but there is an increasing trend since then. No significant changes were observed in the area used for agriculture that comprises the pastures and crop fields since the 1950s, while there is an enormous increase in the area used for settlement, due to a tremendous increase in population from one point in time to another. The bare lands that used to exist in previous years were found to be totally covered with other land cover/use classes and no bare lands were observed in the study area in the year 2010. Population pressure and land use policies were found to be reasons for the changes in land use/cover while soil degradation, decrease in the indigenous woody vegetation and erosion were the observed consequences of the land use/cover changes.",land use/land cover change,image fusion,environmental change,,,,,"Legesse, Dagnachew","Bloeschl, Guenter",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All of the information was summarized in 3383 cells of 8 x 8 km. The area covered by grassland decreased from 67.4 to 61.4% between the study periods. This decrease was associated with an increase in the area of annual crops, mainly soybean, sunflower, wheat, and maize. In some subunits of the RPG, i.e., Flat Inland Pampa, the grassland-to-cropland transition probability was high (p(G ->)C = 3.7 x 10(-2)), whereas in others, i.e., Flooding Pampa, this transition probability was low (p(G ->)C = 6.7 x 10(-3)).

This article uses a multispectral satellite remote sensing and survey-based approach to examine the nexus of LULC and LSE in the Ibadan city region, Nigeria. The spectral reflectance, the sun angle spectral radiance of the Landsat imageries (2000, 2010, 2018) was corrected and converted from digital number. The LULC, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Built-Up Index (NDBI), LSE and LST were obtained from the analysis of Landsat imageries. From the findings, temperature increase was identified as a peculiar environmental issue. Analysis of the Landsat imageries revealed that the NDVI value increased from 0.44 in 2000 to 0.47 in 2018. The NDBI values showed that built-up areas in the core of the urban areas have the highest NDBI values (0.023-0.602). The spatio-temporal trends of LST were related to the changes in LULC, and the built-up area had the highest LSE.

Discharge from the Yellow River system has been modified in numerous ways over the past century, not only as a result of increased demands for water from agriculture and industry, but also due to hydrological disturbance from LUCC, climate change and the construction of dams. The combined effect of these disturbances may have led to water shortages. Considering that there has been little change in long-term precipitation, dramatic decreases in water discharge may be attributed mainly to human activities, such as water usage, water transportation and dam construction. LUCC may also affect water availability, but the relative contribution of LUCC to changing discharge is unclear. In this study, the impact of LUCC on natural discharge (not including anthropogenic usage) is quantified using an attribution approach based on satellite land cover and discharge data. A retention parameter is used to relate LUCC to changes in discharge. We find that LUCC is the primary factor, and more dominant than climate change, in driving the reduction in discharge during 1956-2012, especially from the mid-1980s to the end-1990s. The ratio of each land class to total basin area changed significantly over the study period. Forestland and cropland increased by about 0.58% and 1.41%, respectively, and unused land decreased by 1.16%. Together, these variations resulted in changes in the retention parameter, and runoff generation showed a significant decrease after the mid-1980s.

Despite these ongoing changes, the impacts of LULCC in high latitudes are poorly understood. Studies to reduce this knowledge deficit primarily deploy regional climate models (RCMs) as observations of key variables for LULCC studies are scarce in high latitude regions. As such it is important to understand the limitations of RCMs and identify best practices for designing regional climate modelling experiments for LULCC studies at high latitudes. In this study, twelve 10-year simulations are performed over the Scandinavian Peninsula; six at convection permitting scales (dx similar to 3 km) and six at non-convection permitting scales (dx similar to 15 km). Two of the convection permitting simulations model the present and future climate conditions over the Scandinavian Peninsula. The present-day simulation is comprehensively evaluated for multiple variables (e.g. surface air temperature at 2 m, precipitation) using multiple sources of observations (stations, reanalysis & blended satellite products) where available. Results from the model evaluation points to the need for further model improvement in simulating precipitation and related snow processes as well as the need for observations of surface energy fluxes at high latitudes for evaluation. The remaining eight simulations differ in terms of grid spacing, background climate state (present or future climate), and land cover (conversion of grasslands to evergreen needleleaf or mixed forest). Our study highlights the strengths and limitations of common RCM design considerations, such as simulation length (single year vs. multi-years), background climate state (present vs. future climate) and model resolution (convection permitting vs. non-convection permitting). A key recommendation is that high-latitude modeling studies of LULCC should prioritize computational resources for multi-decadal and ensemble simulations over short, single experiment simulations at convection permitting scales.",land use change,land cover change,land-atmosphere interactions,WRF model,convection permitting,high-latitudes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A family of statistical and mathematical techniques is adopted here in order to compare the MODIS data with DES statistics. The comparison at the country level shows estimated forest cover has least uncertainty compared to pasture and barrenland. Comparison at the state level, on the other hand, shows high degree of association between the data sets in cropland (R-2 = 0.9), followed by forest cover and pastureland. Barrenland shows weakest association between DES and MODIS. The computed average accuracy in cropland shows a level of 84% and has been chosen as the best fitted land cover category among all land cover classes selected for the study.

These conditions result in discontinuities in high -temporal -density LULC mapping. In this paper, we developed an integrated time series mapping method to enhance the LULC mapping accuracy and frequency in cloud -prone areas by incorporating spectral -indices -fused deep models and time series reconstruction techniques. The proposed method first reconstructed cloud -contaminated pixels through time series filtering, during which the cloud masks initialized by a deep model were refined and updated during the reconstruction process. Then, the reconstructed time series images were fed into a spectral -indices -fused deep model trained on samples collected worldwide for classification. Finally, post -classification processing, including spatio-temporal majority filtering and time series refinement considering land - water interactions, was conducted to enhance the LULC mapping accuracy and consistency. We applied the proposed method to the cloud- and rainprone Pearl River Delta (i.e., Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area, GBA) and used time series Sentinel -2 images as the experimental data. The proposed method enabled seamless LULC mapping at a temporal frequency of 2 - 5 days, and the production of 10 m resolution annual LULC products in the GBA. The assessment yielded a mean overall accuracy of 87.01% for annual mapping in the four consecutive years of 2019 - 2022 and outperformed existing mainstream LULC products, including ESA WorldCover (83.98%), Esri Land Cover (85.26%), and Google Dynamic World (85.06%). Our assessment also reveals significant variations in LULC mapping accuracies with different cloud masks, thus underscoring their critical role in time series LULC mapping. The proposed method has the potential to generate seamless and near real-time maps for other regions in the world by using deep models trained on datasets collected globally. This method can provide high -quality LULC data sets at different time intervals for various land and water dynamics in cloud- and rain -prone regions.

Insight into the complex relationship between the drivers of LULC change and catchment hydrology is of utmost importance to decision makers. Contemplating the dynamic rainfall -runoff response of the Indian catchments, this study proposes an integrated modeling -based approach to identify the drivers and relative contribution to catchment hydrology. The proposed approach was evaluated in the tropical climate Nagavali River Basin (NRB) (9512 km 2 ) of India. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model, which uses daily -scale rainfall, temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, solar radiation, and streamflow information was integrated with the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) technique to characterize the plausible changes in the flow regime of the NRB. Subsequently, the Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) based modeling analysis was performed to quantify the relative contribution of individual LULC components on the catchment water balance. The outcomes of the study revealed that forest land has been significantly converted to agricultural land (45 - 59%) across the NRB resulting in mean annual streamflow increase of 3.57 m 3 /s during the monsoon season. The affinity between land use class and streamflow revealed that barren land (CN = 83 - 87) exhibits the maximum positive response to streamflow followed by the built-up land (CN = 89 - 91) and fallow land (CN = 88 - 93). The period 1985 - 1995 experienced an increased ET scenario (911 - 1050 mm), while the recent period (2005 - 2020) experienced reduced ET scenario owing to conversion of forest to agricultural land.

We find that land use strongly alters both TC and CS, with stronger effects on CS than on TC across tropical biomes, especially in tropical moist forests. In comparison to the TC-CS correlation observed in the potential vegetation (biome-level R based on tropical ecozones = 0.56-0.90), land use strongly increases this correlation (biome-level R based on tropical ecozones = 0.87-0.94) in the actual vegetation. Increased correlations are not only the effects of land cover change. We additionally identify land management impacts in closed forests, which cause CS reductions.

We compare the results with the WRF simulation using the standard 30-arc second USGS Land Cover and topography, and with observations of the ARPA network. We focus on the Lombardy region (north Italy) for the periods January-February and July-August 2008.Our analysis shows that simulated average wind speeds are in general lower by the WRF simulation with the SRTM and Corine Land Cover than the WRF simulation with the 30-arc second USGS and agrees better with the observations. The reason for this is that the Corine Land Cover shows a larger fraction of the 'urban and built-up' category than the USGS data set, which leads to more friction and higher roughness in the domain and lowers the wind speeds at ground level. For the winter period, the WRF simulation with the SRTM and Corine Land Cover calculates on average higher temperatures over the model domain (between similar to 0.2 and similar to 1.0 degrees C and up to similar to 1.2 degrees C for Milan) than the simulation using USGS data. For the summer period the differences in average temperatures are larger up to 2.7 degrees C, while for Milan the differences are around 0.7 degrees C. The differences are related to the higher fraction of urban and built-up area in the Corine Land Cover, which affects the sensible and latent heat fluxes in the model domain and holds the heat between the buildings. R-2 values are on average a factor of 1.03 and 1.14 higher for the winter and summer periods, respectively. Comparing the hit rate statistics of the precipitation events reveals that probability of detection of the precipitation event and the Hansen-Kuipers score is on average 1% higher by the simulation with SRTM and Corine Land Cover than the WRF simulation with the standard USGS data set.

We assessed relationships between the number of interpretation updates following feedback and the variables grouped in personal, training, and environmental categories. Variable importance was assessed using random forest regression. Personal variable interpreter identifier and training variable timestamp were found the strongest predictors of update counts, while the environmental variables complexity and image availability had least impact.

Our approach is founded on two realistic assumptions: (1) land cover disturbances are rare events over large geographic areas that occur within a short time frame; and (2) spatially discrete land cover disturbances are continuous processes over time. Applying statistically rigorous algorithms, we first detect disturbance pixels as outliers of an underlying chi-square distribution. Then, we fit nonlinear, logistic curves for each identified change pixel to simultaneously characterize the magnitude and timing of the disturbance. Our method is applied using the yearly Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) tree cover product from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and the resulting disturbance-year estimates are evaluated using a large sample of Landsat-based forest disturbance data. Temporal accuracy is similar to 65% at 250-m, annual resolution and increases to >85% when temporal resolution is relaxed to +/- 1 yr. The r(2) of MODIS VCF-based disturbance rates against Landsat ranges from 0.7 to 0.9 at 5-km spatial resolution.

Results show that LULCC induces about the changes of 0.1-0.3 degrees C in surface air temperature over areas undergoing the conversion between forest and crop with clear regionality and seasonality. The responses of extreme temperature are more sensitive to LULCC than those of mean temperature, especially for the daily minimum temperature (Tmin)-related indices. Disagreements in the temperature responses between the two models are simulated during most of the years, particularly over east China during summer. Such uncertainties can be explained by the diversity responses of available energy, which is related to large scale atmospheric circulations produced by the RCM. The extent of LULCC can determine both the magnitude and sign of changes in temperature. LULCC-related changes of Tmax and Tmin can be as large as 25% of those by GHG. LULCC contributes less than 10% to the total projected warming under RCP4.5 when averaged over sub-regions but can reaches up to about 30% on local scales. Those results highlight the important role of LULCC in projecting the regional to local scale temperature changes, and emphasize the necessity of including LULCC forcing in future regional modeling studies.",Land use,land cover change (LULCC),RegCM4,Temperature,Uncertainty,,,"Fu, Congbin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent decades, land use and land cover (LULC) in the Mekong Delta has undergone tremendous changes due to increasing anthropogenic activities. However, accurate and long-term LULC mapping products for the entire delta are scarce. This study aims to use the Landsat and Chinese HJ-1B satellite images for nearly 40 years to detect the spatiotemporal dynamics of LULC in the Mekong Delta applying the classification and regression trees (CART) technique and analyze its driving factors. Seven main LULC categories were identified with an overall accuracy of 89-94%. We generated seven LULC maps of the whole Mekong Delta from 1979 to 2015 at a 30 m spatial resolution. The results showed that the area of aquaculture and residential land increased, while the area of mangroves, planting land, other forests, wasteland, and unused land decreased from 1979 to 2015. The planting land has been the dominant land use type in the delta since 1979, and still occupied over 72% of the delta area in 2015. The change to aquaculture is most pronounced in all LULC categories, with its percentage of area in the delta increasing to 19% in 2015. With the transformation of large-scale inland planting land into aquaculture ponds, aquaculture has become the second largest land use type following the planting land in the Mekong Delta from the late 20th century. Although the mangrove area showed only slight reduction during 1979-2015, the degree of patch fragmentation increased significantly. We found that the rapid changes of the LULC were mainly driven by economic development and land policies. This study gives insights into LULC dynamics and provides a valuable dataset for regional sustainable development planning and ecological assessment in the Mekong Delta. (C) 2020 The Authors.

It focusses on the Northern Ecuadorian Amazonas (NEA) which is characterised by high biodiversity and endemism but at the same time is threatened by deforestation and unsustainable land use practices. Scenario simulations mimic LULC change during 2016-2030 at canton-level (area: 2,146 km2) combining explorative with policy-screening components. Scenarios NATIONAL(+)POLICY, NATIONAL(-)POLICY, REGIONAL(+)POLICY, and REGIONAL(-)POLICY are contrasted by varying deforestation trends (high regional demand for agricultural products vs. national-level structural transformations) and the enforcement/ non-enforcement of policy bundles on forest protection, reforestation and restoration. An indicator-based impact assessment analysed in a spatially-explicit fashion for each scenario in 2030 (i) the evolution of agricultural and forestry-related LULC change trajectories, (ii) future hotspots of deforestation, (iii) remaining forest core zones (FCZ) as key element of habitat integrity, and (iv) the provisioning of long-term carbon sinks. Key findings reveal that only NATIONAL(+)POLICY, as the combination of enforced policy bundles and simulated national LULC change trend extrapolating the long-term reference period 1990-2016, lead to an expansion of forest areas and a 2% carbon stock gain in 2030 compared to 2016. When assuming a linear continuation of this trend, it requires 96 years to reach a similar carbon stock level compared to the reference year 1990. Farm area expansion will continue to affect protected forests in case of scenarios NATIONAL(-)POLICY and REGIONAL(-)POLICY but will be avoided in NATIONAL(+)POLICY and REGIONAL(+)POLICY. The simulated persistence of many farming areas reveals that the likelihood to reforest existing agricultural patches will be rather low. Against expectations, scenario NATIONAL(+)POLICY which assumes net zero deforestation by 2030 led to a high level of FCZ fragmentation contrasting its carbon sink potential (27,971 Mio. Mg ha-1) which performed best among all scenarios. Our study depicts a mismatch of future LULC change realities compared to the anticipated future achievements of the Ecuadorian land use policy framework. The simulated variability of forest change patterns (deforestation, reforestation) and farming trajectories (diversification, intensification, rotation) further suggests to foster more cross-sectoral policy approaches that acknowledges the hybrid role of local stakeholders who can be farmers and forest users at the same time. Our study shows that focusing on preserving carbon stocks and their long-term climate mitigation potential only while neglecting other important ecosystem functions or biodiversity can be a short-sighted policy goal if not accompanied by rural development programmes. We further conclude that scenario-based assessments should become an integral part of multi-stakeholder interactions across relevant levels of decision-making. This can support long-term sustainable land use management which is not only relevant for the case of the Northern Ecuadorian Amazons region but for many other landscapes in transition.",Land use land cover (LULC) change modelling,Land use policy enforcement,Tropical forests,Impact assessment,Northern Ecuadorian Amazonas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study used parametric weighted distance function where the weighted inverse distance function (WIDF) was used in determining the contamination effective contribution area (Aec) for each LULC type of a particular location using Landsat 2020 classified image and 30 m DEM. The results showed a wide range of WQI values, with several significant correlations between LULC and water quality. Turbidity, total dissolved solids (TDS), iron (Fe-2+), and electrical conductivity (EC) showed strong correlations with LULC (R-2 > 0.7). Turbidity and Fe2+ were more correlated with built-up and forested areas (p-Value <0.05), respectively. Whereas, TDS and EC were more correlated with cropland (p-Value <0.05). The feacal coliform showed a weak correlation with LULC (R-2 = 0.258), but had a significant correlation with built-up areas (p-Value <0.05). The WQI had a reasonable correlation with LULC (R-2 = 0.649). Understanding these relationships could improve decision-making on land use planning and water quality management, predict river water quality, and shape sustainable LULC policies.

Previous studies of Cerrado land-use and land-cover (LULC) change imply spatial homogeneity, report widely varying rates of land conversion, use ambiguous LULC categories, and generally do not attempt to validate results. This study addresses this gap in the literature by analyzing moderate-resolution, multi-spectral satellite remote sensing data from 1986 to 2002 in two regions with identical underlying drivers. Unsupervised classification by the ISODATA algorithm indicates that Cerrado was converted to agro-pastoral land covers in 31% (3646km(2)) of the study region in western Bahia and 24% (3011 km(2)) of the eastern Mato Grosso study region, while nearly 40% (4688 km(2) and 5217 km(2), respectively) of each study region remained unchanged. Although aggregate land change is similar, large and contiguous fragments persist in western Bahia, while smaller fragments remain in eastern Mato Grosso. These findings are considered in the current context of Cerrado land-use policy, which is dominated by the conservation set-aside and command-control policy models. The spatial characteristics of Cerrado remnants create considerable obstacles to implement the models; an alternative approach, informed by countryside biogeography, may encourage collaboration between state officials and farmer-landowners toward conservation land-use policies.

The effects of farmland expansion in Northeast China, grassland degradation in Northwest China, and deforestation in South China were simulated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model in addition to the latest actual land cover datasets. The simulated results show that when forestland is converted to farmland, the air temperature decreased owing to an increase in surface albedo in Northeast China. The climatic effect of grassland degradation on the Loess Plateau was insignificant because of the negligible difference in albedo between grassland and cropland. In South China, deforestation generally led to a decrease in temperature. Furthermore, the temperature decrease caused by the increase in albedo counteracted the warming effects of the evapotranspiration decrease, so the summer temperature change was not significant in South China, Excluding the effects of urbanization in the North China Plain, the LUCC effects across the entire region of East China presented an overall cooling trend. However, the variation in temperature scale and magnitude was less in summer than that in winter. This result is due mainly to the cooling caused by the increase in albedo offset partly by the increase in temperature caused by the decrease in evaporation in summer. Summer precipitation showed a trend of increasing-decreasing-increasing from southeast to northwest after LUCC, which was induced mainly by the decrease in surface roughness and cyclone circulations appearing northwest of Northeast China, in the middle of the Loess Plateau, and in Yunnan province at 700 hPa after forests were converted into farmland. All results will be instructive for understanding the influence of LUCC on regional climate and future land planning in practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Such environments reflect the economic conditions and quality of life of the individual country. Urbanization is generally influenced by national laws, plans and policies and by power, politics and poor governance in many less-developed countries. Remote sensing tools play a vital role in monitoring LULC change and measuring the rate of urbanization at both the local and global levels. The current study evaluated the LULC changes and urban expansion of Jhapa district of Nepal. The spatial-temporal dynamics of LULC were identified using six time-series atmospherically-corrected surface reflectance Landsat images from 1989 to 2016. A hybrid cellular automata Markov chain (CA-Markov) model was used to simulate future urbanization by 2026 and 2036. The analysis shows that the urban area has increased markedly and is expected to continue to grow rapidly in the future, whereas the area for agriculture has decreased. Meanwhile, forest and shrub areas have remained almost constant. Seasonal rainfall and flooding routinely cause predictable transformation of sand, water bodies and cultivated land from one type to another. The results suggest that the use of Landsat time-series archive images and the CA-Markov model are the best options for long-term spatiotemporal analysis and achieving an acceptable level of prediction accuracy. Furthermore, understanding the relationship between the spatiotemporal dynamics of urbanization and LULC change and simulating future landscape change is essential, as they are closely interlinked.

The covers at national scale (1:250,000) are broken off by state and a transition probability matrix was generated of the types of vegetation/land use for each state. Then, through a system of equations of logit models, the transition probabilities were related to climate, physical and socioeconomic variables, in order to explain the change dynamics of forests and rainforests in the country. This methodology allows analyzing the changes in each type of vegetation isolated from the different uses, with which the prediction and understanding of the change dynamics of land cover are improved. This allows clearly identifying the causes of deforestation and provides information to develop and focus better policy instruments linked to the reduction of deforestation. The results showed that the basic transitions of forest regions to crops and grasslands follow different dynamics in forest and in rainforests.

In recent decades, China's rapid growth, expanding population, urban sprawl, and diminishing high-quality farmland have presented a compelling case suitable for exploring solutions and challenges related to this critical issue. Therefore, there is an urgent need for comprehensive and detailed information regarding land systems. Here, we developed the first fine-scale dataset of the China Land System at a spatial resolution of 1 km, covering the period from 2000 to 2015. By leveraging this comprehensive land information, we identified five primary types of land systems and their respective subsystems, thereby delineating distinct patterns of human-environmental interaction. Land system dynamics followed diverse developmental trajectories characterized by incremental shifts toward more functionally centralized systems. Land use intensification played a significant role in increasing the population capacity and food production in China, contributing nearly 93.94% and 84.99%, respectively. In contrast, land cover changes accounted for only 4.69% and 11.43%, respectively. These findings underscore the tendency of previous studies to overestimate the impact of land cover change and underestimate the influence of land use intensification in meeting the growing demands of land-based production.

We take the commonly used FAOSTAT-based global Land Use Harmonization data (LUH2) and a new high-resolution multisource harmonized national LULCC database (YLmap) to drive a land ecosystem model (DLEM) in the conterminous United States. We found that recent cropland abandonment and forest recovery may have been overestimated in the LUH2 data derived from national statistics, causing previously reported C emissions from land use have been underestimated due to the definition of cropland and aggregated LULCC signals at coarse resolution. This overestimation leads to a strong C sink (30.3 +/- 2.5 Tg C/year) in model simulations driven by LUH2 in the United States during the 1980-2016 period, while we find a moderate C source (13.6 +/- 3.5 Tg C/year) when using YLmap. This divergence implies that previous C budget analyses based on the global LUH2 dataset have underestimated C emission in the United States owing to the delineation of suitable cropland and aggregated land conversion signals at coarse resolution which YLmap overcomes. Thus, to obtain more accurate quantification of LULCC-induced C emission and better serve global C budget accounting, it is urgently needed to develop fine-scale country-specific LULCC data to characterize the details of land conversion.",carbon fluxes,conterminous United States,cropland abandonment,cropland expansion,forest recovery,land use and land cover change,,"Canadell, Josep G.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To understand the impacts of climate and land use/cover changes on streamflow within a specific catchment, it is essential to accurately quantify their changes given many possibilities. We propose an integrated framework to assess how individual and combined climate and land use/cover changes impact the streamflow of Xinanjiang Basin, in East China, in the future. Five bias-corrected and downscaled General Circulation Model (GCM) projections are used to indicate the inter-model uncertainties under three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Additionally, three land use/cover change scenarios representing a range of tradeoffs between ecological protection (EP) and urban development (UD) are projected by Cellular Automata - Markov (CA-Markov). The streamflow in 2021-2050 is then assessed using the calibrated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) with 15 scenarios and 75 possibilities. Finally, the uncertainty and attribution of streamflow changes to climate and land use/cover changes at monthly and annual scale are analyzed. Results show that while both land use/cover change alone and combined changes project an increase in streamflow, there is a disagreement on the direction of streamflow change under climate change alone. Future streamflow may undergo a more blurred boundary between the flood and non-flood seasons, potentially easing the operation stress of Xinanjiang Reservoir for water supply or hydropower generation. We find that the impacts of climate and land use/cover changes on monthly mean streamflow are sensitive to the impermeable area (IA).The impacts of climate change are stronger than those induced by land use/cover change under EP (i.e., lower IA); and land use/cover change has a greater impact in case of UD (i.e., higher IA). However, changes in annual mean streamfiow are mainly driven by land use/cover change, and climate change may decrease the influence attributed to land use/cover change. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the Revised Wind Erosion Equation (RWEQ) and Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) were used to reveal changes in the extent of soil erosion by wind and water in the Qaidam Basin from 2000 to 2018 and the impact of LUCC on them. From 2000 to 2018, with global climate change, the areas and intensities of soil erosion by wind decreased, whereas those of soil erosion by water increased. With increased human activities, approximately 12.96% of the total area underwent conversion of the type of use: the areas of cropland, woodland, grassland, and construction land increased, whereas the areas of shrubbery, desert, and other unused land decreased. Land use/cover changes are positive to the soil erosion of water but negative to the soil erosion of wind. Among them, the changes in vegetation coverage of other unused land and grassland contributed to 83.19% of the total reduction in soil erosion by water. Converting other unused land to grassland reduced the total reductions in soil erosion by wind by 94.69%. These results indicate that the increase in vegetative cover and area of grasslands in the Qaidam Basin had a positive impact on the reduction in soil erosion. It is recommended that the arrangement of grasses, shrubs, and trees be optimized to prevent compound erosion by wind and water for protecting regional ecological environments.",Qaidam Basin,soil erosion,RWEQ,RUSLE,land use and land cover change,,,"Jian, Jinshi","Bai, Leichao","Li, Jianjun","Ma, Xiaowu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding LULCCs at the watershed level is essential for transboundary river basin management. The present study aims to analyse the past and future LULCCs in two significant watersheds of the Senegal River basin (SRB) in West Africa: Bafing and Faleme. This study used Landsat images from 1986, 2006 and 2020 and the Random Forest classification method to analyze past LULCCs in these two watersheds. The results revealed: In Bafing, vegetation, settlement, agricultural areas and water increased, while the bareground decreased significantly between 1986-2020. In Faleme, two periods have different trends. Between 1986-2006, vegetation, settlement, agricultural areas and water increased, while bareground decreased. Between 2006-2020, settlement increased, while vegetation, agricultural areas, water and bareground decreased. To predict LULCCs in 2050 under business-as-usual assumptions, the Multilayer Perceptron and Marcov Chain model (MLP-MC) was used. The MLP-MC shows better results on Bafing than on Faleme but without questioning its application on the two watersheds.

In this paper, we have developed a hybrid analytical framework that couples natural and socioeconomic systems, and used socioeconomic data, high-resolution remote sensing data, and empirical coefficients to analyze spatiotemporal dynamics of carbon metabolism and applied ecological network analysis (ENA) to evaluate integrated effects of LULC changes upon carbon metabolism. We used Gansu Province, an economically underdeveloped region, as an example for case analysis and policy recommendations. The results showed that: (1) the total carbon emissions in Gansu increased 3.18 times between 1995 and 2020, with transportation and industrial land being the major contributors. The carbon balance status was increasingly severe, and the amount of carbon sequestration to offset carbon emissions decreased from 22.45% in 1995 to 7.11% in 2020. (2) ENA revealed that competition relations between land use types fluctuated up and dominated in 2020, with the mean value of mutualism index was 0.72, which suggested that that integrated effects of LULC changes on whole regional carbon metabolism was negative. Compared to developed regions, the ecological relationships between different land use types in Gansu were more competitive. (3) To address these issues, we have proposed comprehensive policies in terms of adjusting industrial structure, reducing fossil energy use, saving land for construction, and developing carbon sink industries. The study explored the intricate interactions between LULC changes, carbon transition, and regional carbon metabolism in underdeveloped region, and its framework and findings provide insights and recommendations for spatial planning and carbon management in Gansu Province and other regions that may have comparable challenges.",Carbon metabolism,Land use and land cover,Ecological network analysis,Ecological relationships,,,,"Pang, Jiaxing","Long, Zhi","Chen, Yanbi","Zhang, Zilong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study aims to assess the impact of land use/land cover (LULC) on the groundwater table, and its quality in the tropical unconfined aquifers. Two hundred groundwater samples were collected from 100 sampling wells during monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. The drinking water quality index and irrigation quality indices were estimated based on the various parameters obtained from the laboratory analysis. Human health risk concerning nitrate contamination was evaluated based on the USEPA method. The land-use/land-cover map prepared using ArcGIS showed that the study area consists dominantly of croplands. Drinking water quality index results suggested that the groundwater samples were excellent to moderately suitable for drinking purposes. Only one sample was unsuitable for drinking. The different irrigation quality indices revealed various degrees of groundwater suitability for irrigation purposes. The spatial distribution of the corrosivity ratio suggests avoiding the metal pipe, for transportation of groundwater supply in the northern part of the study area. Fertilizers used in agriculture and soak pit leakages have contributed to high nitrate concentration in a few parts of the study area. Human health risk assessment showed that infants are vulnerable to non-carcinogenic health risks. The impact of the LULC assessment revealed that groundwater quality was moderately suitable for drinking in urban land. The study suggests implementing proper sewage treatment measures to avoid groundwater contamination. Overall, the findings are important in adopting site-specific, groundwater management strategies in the study area. Polluted and unpolluted areas demarcated in the study are beneficial for decision-makers to develop suitable groundwater management plans.

The aim of this paper is to assess the impact of land ownership on the environmental status of small, but environmentally valuable lake catchments. The study of environmental quality in terms of ownership and land cover was conducted in lake catchments located in the central part of the West Polesie Transboundary Biosphere Reserve. In total, the ownership type was determined for 5661 plots and the land cover type was determined for 2502 subdivisions. The quality of the analysed elements of the study catchments was subjected to expert evaluation using a modified Stapel Scale and was presented using two Qualitative Indexes proposed: Land Cover [Lc] and Land Ownership [Lo]. The obtained values of Index Lc ranged from-0.18 to +1.97, and Index Lo from-1.87 to +2.00. Application of the Average Land Quality Index [LQ], in turn, made it possible to randomise the environmental quality of the analysed catchments, for which it was from-1.02 to +1.99 (areas of very good and very poor environmental quality, respectively). The analyses indicated, for example, catchments that were significantly degraded because of a very large number of private plots in their area- in the five analysed catchments, this ranged from 505 to 719 and their average area was 0.19-1.10 ha. It is noteworthy that very unfavourable land ownership conditions and land cover structure were found in the Poleski National Park catchments - the area with the highest protection status.

Other landscapes have experienced changes too, but on a smaller scale. The aim of the present study was to identify landscape transformation and driving forces behind it.Materials and methodsSpatiotemporal changes of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) were recorded using GIS techniques. Land Cover data from Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) with spatial resolution 100 m for three different years: 2000, 2006 and 2018 were analysed. DEM with 10 m spatial resolution was used to estimate slope steepness and catchment altitude.

Land use change significantly drives SOC stock variation. In tropical central and eastern Africa, how changes in land use and land cover impact on soil C stocks remains unclear. Variability in the existing data is typically explained by soil and climate factors with little consideration given to land use and management history. To address this knowledge gap, we classified the current and historical land cover and measured SOC stocks under different land cover, soil group and slope type in the humid zone of south-west Rwanda. It was observed that SOC levels were best explained by contemporary land cover types, and not by soil group, conversion history or slope position, although the latter factors explained partly the variation within annual crop land cover type. Lack of the influence of land use history on SOC stocks suggests that after conversion to a new land use/land cover, SOC stocks reached a new equilibrium within the timestep that was observed (25 years). For conversion to annual crops, SOC stocks reach a new equilibrium at about 2.5 % SOC concentration which is below the proposed soil fertility threshold of 3 % SOC content in the Eastern and central African region. SOC stock declined under transitions from banana-coffee to annual crop by 5 % or under transitions from natural forest to degraded forest by 21 % and increased for transitions from annual crops to plantation forest by 193 %. Forest clearing for agricultural use resulted in a loss of 72 %. Assuming steady states, the data can also be used to make inferences about SOC changes as a result of land cover changes. We recommend that SOC stocks should be reported by land cover type rather than by soil groups which masks local land cover and landscape differences. This study addresses a critical issue on sustainable management of SOC in the tropics and global carbon cycle given that it is performed in a part of the world that has high land cover dynamics while at the same time lacks data on land cover changes and SOC dynamics.",Land use change,Soil organic carbon,Soil fertility,Land degradation,Soil C sequestration,Global climate change,,"Tumwesigye, Wycliffe","Smaling, Eric Marc Alexander","Jetten, Victor",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pingtan has been experiencing rapid LCC recently, but it is not well documented. The general objective of this study is to detect land cover dynamics using three Landsat images from the years 2000, 2009 and 2013 based on metrics of land cover transition and pattern, together with driving factors. The overall trends in LCC depicted the expansion of forest land (6.75%), shrubland (4.81%), urban land (12.05%) and rural settlement (15.54%), as well as the reduction of grassland (- 17.86%), water body (- 0.71%), wetland (- 3.23%), farmland (- 17.16%) and bare land (- 0.19%). The land use intensity was also increased. Transformation of each land cover type was characterized by unbalanced expansion and contraction simultaneously and a spatial shift in their locations. During 2000-2013, a class-to-class transformation was dominated by the expansion of urban land and rural settlement (70.26% of gross gain), as well as the reduction of farmland and grassland (59.69% of gross loss). Landscape-level metrics indicated the decline of landscape heterogeneity and shape irregularities. However, there are some inconsistencies at the class level.

The objective of this study was to analyze the hydrological impacts of LULC changes in the Andassa watershed for a period of 1985-2015 and to predict the LULC change impact on the hydrological status in year 2045. The hybrid land use classification technique for classifying Landsat images (1985, 2000 and 2015); Cellular-Automata Markov (CA-Markov) for prediction of the 2030 and 2045 LULC states; the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for hydrological modeling were employed in the analyses. In order to isolate the impacts of LULC changes, the LULC maps were used independently while keeping the other SWAT inputs constant. The contribution of each of the LULC classes was examined with the Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) model. The results showed that there was a continuous expansion of cultivated land and built-up area, and withdrawing of forest, shrubland and grassland during the 1985-2015 periods, which are expected to continue in the 2030 and 2045 periods. The LULC changes, which had occurred during the period of 1985 to 2015, had increased the annual flow (2.2%), wet seasonal flow (4.6%), surface runoff (9.3%) and water yield (2.4%). Conversely, the observed changes had reduced dry season flow (2.8%), lateral flow (5.7%), groundwater flow (7.8%) and ET (0.3%). The 2030 and 2045 LULC states are expected to further increase the annual and wet season flow, surface runoff and water yield, and reduce dry season flow, groundwater flow, lateral flow and ET. The change in hydrological components is a direct result of the significant transition from the vegetation to non-vegetation cover in the watershed. This suggests an urgent need to regulate the LULC in order to maintain the hydrological balance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

But many pastoralists have changed from a pastoral way of life to mixed farming over time. The aim of this study was to evaluate land-use and land cover (LULC) changes in the Central Rift Valley dry lands of Ethiopia, and determine the role of drought vulnerability as a driver. A combination of GIS/remote sensing techniques, drought vulnerability analyses, field observation and surveying were employed. Because drought vulnerability is linked more closely to the types of land-uses and social contexts rather than only climatological events, it was examined based on locally perceived criteria of drought. Accordingly, the pastoral way of life was vulnerable to severe drought during 25% of the last 28 years while the mixed farming (livestock and maize farming combined) system was vulnerable to severe drought only during 4% of the years. Over the last 5 decades, cultivated lands increased to threefold while the dense acacia coverage declined from 42% in 1965 to 9% in 2010. The observed LULC changes were driven by the interplay of recurrent drought, socioeconomic and institutional dynamics, access to markets and improved technologies such as early-maturing maize cultivars and better land management. Proper policy and technological interventions are required to develop appropriate drought adaptation strategies and avert the increasing degradation of woodlands in the Rift Valley dry lands where a pastoral way of life is still present.

The objectives of study were to map and study the changes in land use/cover and landscape pattern, and propose some possible factors in making the land use/cover changes from 1989 to 2009. Seven different types of land use/cover are analysed, and the results are listed in tables. From 1989 to 1998, the percentage of farmland, slight-moderate saline land, heavy saline land and water areas have increased; woodland, desert and the undeveloped land have decreased. From 1998 to 2009, farmland, heavy saline land and the undeveloped land have increased; the other types of land use/cover have decreased. The gravity centre of each land use/cover types has shifted. The farthest shifting of the gravity centre was heavy saline land, which occurred between 1989 and 1998. The transformation and changes of land use/covers and landscape occurred more frequently from 1989 to 2009. Other types of land use and land cover changes to saline land have increased, which implied that a serious salinization took place in the Tarim Basin.

The land use types in the study area were categorized into six classes: natural forest, plantation forest, cultivated land, shrub land, grass land and bare land. The result shows the cover classes which has high environmental role such as forest and shrub has decreased dramatically through time with cultivated land increasing during the same period in the watershed. The forest cover in 1984 was about 6.5% of the total catchment area, and it had decreased to 4.2% in 2015. In contrast, cultivated land increased from 38.7% in 1984 to 51% in 2015. Shrub land decreased from 28 to 18% in the same period. Bare land increased due to high gully formation in the catchment. In 1984, it was 1.8% which turned to 0.6% in 1995 then increased in 2015 to 2.7%. Plantation forest was not detected in 1984. In 1995, it covers 1.5% which turned to be the same in 2015. The study clearly demonstrated that there are significant changes of land use and land cover in the catchment. The findings will allow making informed decision which will allow better land use management and environmental conservation interventions.",Accuracy assessment,Change detection,Land use,cover change,Remote sensing and GIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the well-established importance of Northern Eurasia in the global carbon and climate system, the distribution and properties of land cover in this region are not well characterized. To address this knowledge and data gap, a hierarchical mapping approach was developed that encompasses the study area for the Northern Eurasia Earth System Partnership Initiative (NEESPI). The Northern Eurasia Land Cover (NELC) database developed in this study follows the FAO-land Cover Classification System and provides nested groupings of land cover characteristics, with separate layers for land use, wetlands, and tundra. The database implementation is substantially different from other large-scale land cover datasets that provide maps based on a single set of discrete classes. By providing a database consisting of nested maps and complementary layers, the NELC database provides a flexible framework that allows users to tailor maps to suit their needs. The methods used to create the database combine empirically derived climate-vegetation relationships with results from supervised classifications based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The hierarchical approach provides an effective framework for integrating climate-vegetation relationships with remote sensing-based classifications, and also allows sources of error to be characterized and attributed to specific levels in the hierarchy. The cross-validated accuracy was 73% for the land cover map and 73% and 91% for the agriculture and wetland classifications, respectively. These results support the use of hierarchical classification and climate-vegetation relationships for mapping land cover at continental scales. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Understanding such dynamics is instrumental for the implementation of public policies in a more rational and planned manner, ensuring a better balance between uses and the maintenance of natural habitats, as well as fulfilling the demands of a rapidly growing society. Within this scope, in this study we applied statistical sampling techniques to remote sensing data (Landsat images from 1985 to 2017) in order to retrieve information on the dynamics of land use in one of the most prominent agricultural frontier regions in the world. Specifically, we chose the Brazilian state of Goias, located in the Cerrado biome, which is a biodiversity hotspot for its natural value and high endangerment level. Our results yielded estimates showing, in a first moment (1986 - 1996), the suppression of native vegetation concomitant with the expansion of pasture areas. From 1997 onward, this dynamic coexisted with the advance of annual crops and sugarcane over pasture areas (which serve as important land reserves). Our study corroborates the potential of using image-based statistical sampling to understand, in an efficient, agile, unbiased, and accurate manner, the dynamics and history of land uses in any region of interest. Likewise, the synergy between such low cost approach and other datasets (e.g. agricultural surveys) can increase the precision of land-cover and land-use assessments, complementing missing information and refining the identification of occupation patterns and trends. In particular, area estimates, as those generated in this study, can serve to quickly assess the outcomes of public policies focused on reducing deforestation rates and improving the use efficiency of areas already converted.",land-cover / land-use change,land use dynamics,agricultural frontier,agrarian space,statistical sampling,,,"Miziara, Fausto","Ferreira, Laerte Guimaraes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Digitized land use maps for 1978 (LUM78) and topographical maps for 1992 (TOPO92) were first interpreted using a Geographic Information System (GIS); this was followed by comparative interpretation of black and white air photographs from the same years. Lelep, Sekhathum-Amjilesa, Syajunma and Ramsyampati were the 4 areas selected for analysis. The initial map interpretation of LUM78 and TOPO92 implied that considerable changes in land use/cover had occurred between 1978179 and 1992. Forestland was shown to have decreased by 62.5% (23.15 km(2)), agricultural land to have increased by 35.7% (1.49 km(2)), and shrubland to have increased by 238.2% (30.16 km(2)). Grazing land, with an area of 22.57 km(2) on the 1978/79 and 1992 imagery, appeared to have disappeared completely by 1992. An interpretation of air photographs for the same period, however, revealed that the actual changes were far smaller than those inferred from the map interpretation: decrease in forest and grazing lands by 14.9% (5.45 km(2)) and 77.9% (2.75 km(2)), respectively, and increase in agricultural and shrublands by 4.9% (0.21 km(2)) and 19.7% (4.41 km(2)). respectively. The results of a questionnaire survey of the local inhabitants confirmed that no significant changes had occurred. The discrepancies identified highlight the problems inherent in assigning land categories. In particular, distinctions made on the LUM78 material between shrub, grazing land, and barren land were inappropriate. Similarly, forest and shrublands were incorrectly assigned in TOPO92.

Over this period, the Jaffna Peninsula has been impacted severely by armed conflict between the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. A postclassification method is used to compare land use/cover classes from satellite images using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to analyze the spatial pattern of land use/cover changes over the study period. Results indicate that the land use/cover pattern has been very dynamic since early the 1980s, showing a remarkable decrease in agricultural land use and concomitant increase in non-agricultural land uses. The ethnic conflict and its consequences, particularly large-scale population migrations, have been the main driving forces for such land use/cover changes in the Jaffna Peninsula.

Considering city-level areas and various types of land use and land cover, existing LUCC models without constraint or with only loose demand constraints were impractical in providing evidence of high accuracy and high-resolution predictions in areas facing fierce land competition. In this study, we proposed a two-layer SD-ANN-CA model to simulate and explore the LUCC trend and layout predictions for 2018, 2028, and 2038 in Ya'an City, Western China. The two-layer structure with an upper layer of the SD model and a lower layer of the ANN-CA model, as well as the advantages of all three methods of system dynamics (SD), artificial neural network (ANN), and cellular automata (CA), have allowed us to consider the macro-level demand constraints, meso-level driving factors constraints, and the micro-level spatial constraints into a unified model framework.

The layout predictions of all six types of land use in 2028 and 2038 are then carried out to provide visual evidence support, which may improve the efficiency of planning and policy-making processes.

Typical characteristics of LST in summer time and temperature variations over all LULC types were firstly examined. Afterwards, spatial distribution of LST in radial and circumferential directions was characterized based on profile and concentric zonal analysis, in which contributions of LULC types to LST were studied. In addition, models that can effectively predict LST distribution were developed based on multiple linear regression method (MLRM) and the partial least squares regression method (PLSRM). Results indicate that (1) LST of the study area mainly ranges from 32 degrees C to 41 degrees C, where building and road are main drivers leading to hot temperatures. (2) Temperature profiles vary greatly with LULC types, while urban expansion along central axis causes to horizontal arrangement of building and road, resulting in hot but small-fluctuated LST temperature in 0 and 180. (3) Mean and standard deviation of LST in concentric zones are 36.0 +/- 4.2 degrees C, and LST over all LULC types follows the following pattern: building > road >bare land > agricultural land > green land > water bodies. Due to large proportions of building and road, Buffer 3, 4 and 5 undergo the highest temperature. Although green land and water bodies show significant capability to mitigate UHI effects, cooling effects are unapparent when their sizes are small.

As a result of these factors and regarding its location, which is surrounded by agriculture land, the available land area is quickly decreasing. However, the government has established New Asyut city to absorb the urban growth outside the Nile Valley. Yet the region's importance and the increasing population have led to significant urban growth, which has led to increasing loss of agricultural lands within the Nile Valley. Modelling spatially the dynamic change is important for innovative planning strategies. This study's main aims are to characterize the past urban growth process and to investigate a future scenario intended to help decision-makers in redrawing their policies for sustainable development to save the agriculture areas by absorbing the urban sprawl towards the new cities outside the Nile Valley. Satellite-derived Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) maps of the study area from 1990, 2003, and 2015 were processed.

It found that the current urban development process is in a critical stage where urban and rural areas will face unprecedented stress on agriculture areas over the next 15 years. The present policies cannot deal with the future challenges regarding the direction of urban development.

The purpose of this research is to simulate LULC changes in the metropolitan area of Mashhad from 2020 to 2050.this paper utilizes the CA-Markov model and Land Change Modeler (LCM) with two algorithms: multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network and logistic regression (LR), along with natural and social driving factors, to accurately simulate LULC changes in the metropolitan area of Mashhad. The simulated LULC changes for the year 2020 were then compared with actual land use data of 2020 obtained through satellite images from Landsat 8. The model with higher accuracy was subsequently used to simulate future years. The results of the model show that urban land use has had significant changes compared to other Land uses and has increased from 19% of the total area in 2000 to 27% in 2020. The Markov model, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.71 and an overall accuracy coefficient of 0.81, showed more accurate predictions in terms of location for 2020 compared to the other two models, and was therefore used to simulate future years. In addition, the simulation results show that future urban growth in Mashhad will be scattered and discontinuous, mainly occurring in the outskirts of the city instead of the center.

Due to the urbanization, green areas and natural permeable surfaces transform into non-permeable impervious surfaces, yielding an increase in urban land surface temperatures (LST). This causes an environmental phenomenon called urban heat islands (UHI), where urban temperatures are higher than the surrounding rural areas. Satellite remote sensing technology is an effective tool to monitor and quantify the effects of urbanization process with synoptic viewing capability and high temporal resolution. This study focuses on determining the land surface temperature and land use/land cover (LULC) changes in Istanbul for the last three decades and identifying the relation between these parameters using multi-temporal optical and thermal remote sensing data. The study is conducted using Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI/TIR images, which were acquired on June 1984 and June 2017 respectively. In order to assess the land cover change between 1984 and 2017, a vegetation impervious surface -soil (V-I-S) model was applied to the fraction images obtained from linear spectral unmixing process. End-member spectra used in linear spectral umixing were extracted from ASTER spectral library and resampled to band passes of Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI data. In addition to V-I-S model outputs, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) images were produced. A maximum-likelihood classification was also performed to multi spectral bands in order to derive the LULC maps. Water bodies were extracted from imagery using automated water extraction index (AWEI). Thermal infrared bands of Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 are used for the derivation of land surface temperatures. The results of the study indicates that, the amount of impervious surfaces substantially increased along with land surface temperatures over three decades.",Spectral Unmixing,Thermal Remote Sensing,Land Use/Cover,,,,,"Seker, Dursun Zafer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to investigate the effects of LULC and climate change patterns for a better understanding of the hydrological processes of the Birr River watershed. To examine the effects of LULC and climate change patterns on hydrology, three periods of climate data (1986-1996, 1997-2007 and 2008-2018) and three sets of LULC maps (1986, 2001 and 2018) were established. The changes in hydrological flow caused by climate and LULC changes were estimated using the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) and indicator of hydrological alteration (IHA) method. Results showed that the SWAT model performed well during the calibration and validation period at monthly timestep, with R-2 and NSE values of (0.83 and 0.81) and (0.80 and 0.71), respectively. The LULC change increased surface runoff while decreasing baseflow, water yield, and evapotranspiration. This was due to increased agriculture and settlements, and a reduction in bushland, forest, and grassland. Climate change increased surface runoff and water yield while decreasing baseflow and evapotranspiration during 1996-2006. The combined effect of LULC and climate reveals increased surface runoff and a decreased trend of evapotranspiration, whereas baseflow and water yield showed inconsistency. In addition, the IHA found no statistically significant increasing trend for one-day, three-days, seven-day, and thirty-day minimum and maximum daily streamflow in the Birr River watershed.

We mapped the LULC distribution of the desert landscape for 1988, 1999, and 2011. Landsat Thematic Mapper 5 data and ancillary data were classified using the random forests approach. The technique produced LULC maps with an overall accuracy of more than 90%. Analysis of LULC classes from the three dates revealed that the study area was subjected to three different stages of modification, each dominated by different land uses. The use of a spatially explicit land use change modeling approach, such as Markov-CA approach, provides ways for projecting different future scenarios. Markov-CA was used to predict land use change in 2011 and project changes in 2023 by extrapolating current trends. The technique was successful in predicting LULC distribution in 2011 and the results were comparable to the actual LULC for 2011.

Because of sustained economic growth, urbanization and land development, the land cover in Taiwan has undergone frequent use changes. Among the various technologies for monitoring changes in land cover, remote sensing technologies, such as LiDAR, are efficient tools for collecting a broad range of spectral and spatial data. Two types of airborne LiDAR systems exist; full-waveform (FW) LiDAR and traditional discrete-echo LiDAR. Because reflected waveforms are affected by the land object material type and properties, the waveform features can be applied to analyze the characteristics specifically associated with land-cover classification (LCC). Five types of land cover that characterize the volcanic Guishan Island were investigated. The automatic LCC method was used to elucidate the spectral, geomorphometric and textural characteristics. Interpretation keys accompanied by additional information were extracted from the FW LiDAR data for subsequent statistical and separation analyses. The results show that the Gabor texture and geomorphometric features, such as the normalized digital surface model (nDSM) and slopes can enhance the overall LCC accuracy to higher than 90%. Moreover, both the producer and user accuracy can be higher than 92% for forest and built-up types using amplitude and pulse width.

The adapted benefit transfer method was employed to measure the ESI based on LULCC data. LULCC was characterized and measured by single land use dynamic degree, integrated land use dynamic degree, land use intensity, and land use diversity. The results indicated that ESI levels in China experienced a continuously decreasing trend from 1995 to 2015, especially in large metropolitan areas. The relationship between ESI and LULCC exhibited both significant spatial dependence and heterogeneity. Overall, ESI and land use intensity had statistically significant negative associations. However, the association between ESI and LULCC varied greatly over space and in different time periods. The results have important implications for future delineation of ecological conservation priority zones, sustainable development of national land, and the integration of ESI into landscape planning.

This article examines cumulative land cover changes and their impacts on reindeer grazing grounds in the Kyro reindeer herding district in northern Finland. Land cover transitions were studied using Landsat TM and OLI images and topographic maps. The results showed that the herding district has experienced notable land cover changes during the past decades, and most of these changes were directly related to forestry. The proportion of continuous coniferous forests of the total forest cover declined from 92% to 78% between 1987 and 2013. Approximately one third of the forests outside current conservation areas were disturbed by forest management by 2013, and remaining forests were notably more fragmented than forests within conservation areas. The extent of the road and path networks expanded considerably between 1960s and 2010 as a result of increasing logging and tourism. Accumulation of disturbances gradually results in loss of key resources and declined quality of the landscape mosaic from the reindeer herding perspective, which can pose a serious threat to long-term sustainability of the livelihood. Rapid land cover changes in non-protected areas highlight an increasingly important role of conservation areas in maintaining resources for reindeer husbandry in the face of intensifying land use.

Then, the ecological values (EVs) of various cities were calculated to obtain the ecological contribution rate of different land use types in the process of change. Finally, the future development trends of land use and ecological environmental quality were predicted under multiple scenarios using the cellular automata-Markov model, and scientific policy recommendations were proposed. The results showed that the expansion trajectory of the construction land in the urban agglomeration mainly expanded inwards along the mouth of the Pearl River, and the conversion of cultivated land to construction land was the most significant type of land use change. The overall ecological environmental quality of the study area showed a downwards trend, with Shenzhen exhibiting the largest decrease in EVs. Cultivated land contributed significantly to improving regional ecological environmental quality, while the land use transition types with relatively large contributions to environmental quality deterioration were conversions to construction land. Under the scenario of coordinated protection, the degree of cultivated land area reduction was significantly reduced, and the area of forestland showed a positive growth trend, with the expansion trend of construction land being reversed.

The Yellow River Basin (YRB), often referred to as the cradle of Chinese civilization, ranks as the fifth-largest river basin globally. Early inhabitants made significant alterations to the landscape, resulting in substantial damage to natural vegetation, giving rise to prominent regional ecological challenges. By now, the examination of historical LUCC in the YRB over the past millennium remains in the qualitative research stage, primarily due to the limited availability of high-confidence gridded historical LUCC data. This study aims to advance the current historical LUCC research in the YRB from primarily qualitative analysis to an exploration incorporating timing, positioning, and quantification. Based on reconstructed historical cropland, forest, and grassland grid data of 10 km x 10 km from 1000 AD to 2000 AD, the degree of cropland development and the depletion of forests and grasslands were calculated, respectively. Then, the kernel density method was employed for spatiotemporal analysis and interpretation of dynamic changes in land cover. Subsequently, a cartographic visualization depicting the migration trajectories of the land cover gravity centers was generated, allowing for an assessment of the distance and direction of the centroids' movement of cropland, forest, and grassland. The results indicate that the cropland coverage in the YRB escalated from the initial 11.65% to 29.97%, while the forest and grassland coverage dropped from 63.36% to 44.49%. The distribution of cultivated land continually expanded outward from the southeast of the Loess Plateau and the southwest of the North China Plain. All three types of land cover experienced a westward shift in their gravity centers between 1000 and 2000 AD. Besides the population growth and technological advancements, the regime shifts induced by wars, along with land use policies in distinct periods, always served as the predominant factors influencing the conversion between different land covers. This research will present a paradigmatic regional case study contributing to the investigation of historical changes in land use and land cover. Additionally, it will offer historical perspectives beneficial for the advancement of China's objectives in ""Ecological Conservation and High-Quality Development of the Yellow River Basin"".",land use and land cover change (LUCC),spatiotemporal analysis,past millennium,the Yellow River Basin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A multi-faceted approach was adopted, including a land change model (LCM) and Mann-Kendall (MK) test, to evaluate the transition of land cover type, changes in climate, and atmospheric pollutants during 2004-2021 in Pakistan. Moreover, a multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) model and a mathematical model were used to assess the potential contribution of LULCC and climate dynamics to atmospheric pollution. It was revealed that during 2004, croplands covered an area of 9.72 x 104 mile2, accounting for 38% of the total area. However, the area of the croplands increased to 10.1 x 104 mile2, accounting for 40% of the total area in 2021. The MK test showed that the north and west-south regions significantly experienced air pollution, with the increasing trend for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) being 0.89x 1015 molecules/cm2 per year and 0.54 DU/year, respectively. For climate variability, mean precipitation (Precp) and mean surface pressure (SP) showed a prominent increasing trend, with a maximum value of 1 mm/year and 0.01 Kpa/year, respectively. The mean temperature maximum (Tmax) showed an increasing and decreasing trend, with the highest value of 0.28 degrees C/year and 0.08 degrees C/year, respectively. In the context of contribution, the conversion of cropland to grasslands increased the trend for SO2 concentrations. The highest increasing trend of 1.5 DU for ozone (O3) was found due to conversion of grasslands to shrublands. Additionally, regional climate played a significant role in making air pollution stagnant across the country. Precp and wind speed (WS) contributed significantly in escalating NO2 concentrations in Pakistan, while Precp contributed most (0.004 DU) to increasing SO2 concentrations. For O3, the most influential climate factor was Precp.

Watersheds in the Olympic Peninsula, Washington, and the southern Appalachian highlands of western North Carolina were studied to address two questions: (1) Does landscape pattern vary among federal, state, and private lands? (2) Do land-cover changes differ among owners, and if so, what variables explain the propensity of land to undergo change on federal, state, and private lands? Landscape changes were studied between 1975 and 1991 by using spatial databases and a time series of remotely sensed imagery. Differences in landscape pattern were observed between the two study regions and between different categories of land ownership. The proportion of the landscape in forest cover was greatest in the southern Appalachians for both U.S. National Forest and private lands, compared to any landownership category on the Olympic Peninsula. Greater variability in landscape structure through time and between ownership categories was observed on the Olympic Peninsula. On the Olympic Peninsula, landscape patterns did not differ substantially between commercial forest and state Department of Natural Resources lands, both of which are managed for timber, but differed between U.S. National Forest and noncommercial private land ownerships. In both regions, private lands contained less forest cover but a greater number of small forest patches than did public lands.Analyses of land-cover change based on multinomial legit models revealed differences in land-cover transitions through time, between ownerships and between the two study regions. Differences in land-cover transitions between time intervals suggested that additional factors (e.g., changes in wood products or agricultural prices, or changes in laws or policies) cause individuals or institutions to change land management. The importance of independent variables (slope, elevation, distance to roads and markets, and population density) in explaining land-cover change varied between ownerships. This methodology for analyzing land-cover dynamics across land units that encompass multiple owner types should be widely applicable to other landscapes.",land use,land-cover change,landscape ecology,Olympic Peninsula,remote sensing,southern Appalachians,spatial analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The article summarizes the basic information, classification systems, application fields, challenges, and trends of 107 satellite LULC products (59 general and 48 thematic products). In terms of spatial scale, there are 56 global, 16 continental and 35 national products, with the spatial resolution ranging from 1 m to 100 km. China's SinoLC-1 is the only product with 1 m spatial resolution. Meanwhile, the temporal frequency of the 54 products is from 1 to 10 years, with 52 single-date products also available. Dynamic World provides a near real-time global LULC mapping service. Significant differences exist between the various LULC products, and the differences in classification schemes are one of the primary factors leading to inconsistency and uncertainty. Most LULC products based on remote sensing use the Land Cover Classification Systems (LCCS) developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), but the detailed classification is often absent for categories other than forests. And distinct LULC products find applications across various study domains that span different scales. Currently, the classification system, temporal and spatial resolution, product accuracy, and validation datasets remain constraints to applying LULC products. However, LULC products have been gradually advancing towards finer classification and higher spatial and temporal resolution, with the use of deep learning, cloud computing, and multiple data sources becoming a major trend.

Global full trade liberalization on all goods is the optimum policy for South Asia despite significant global deforestation, but for the world, unilateral partial trade liberalization on all goods is a more appropriate policy while ensuring a considerable emissions reduction for South Asia. These results indicate that mitigation responses to climate change are location specific and no one trade policy is suitable at the regional and global levels.

Two of the most widely used land-cover datasets for the U.S. are the National Land-Cover Data (NLCD) at 30-m resolution and the Global Land-Cover Characteristics (GLCC) at 1-km nominal resolution. Both datasets were produced around 1992 and were expected to contribute similar land-cover information. This study investigated the NLCD distribution within each of 11 GLCC classes at 1-km unit in ten U.S. states. Our analyses showed that the NLCD had similar spatial distribution as the GLCC for the classes of grassland, shrubland, as well as deciduous and evergreen forests. Meanwhile, the GLCC class of cropland and pasture was highly correlated to the NLCD classes of row crops and pasture/hay. The GLCC savanna was appropriately related to the NLCD grassland, pasture/hay, and deciduous forest. The NLCD classes of row crops, pasture, and deciduous forest mainly dominated the GLCC class of cropland/woodland mosaic. Spatial similarity was lower for the GLCC classes of mixed forest, wooded wetland, and cropland/grassland mosaic. In addition to the NLCD urban areas, the GLCC urban and built-up lands were consistently related to the NLCD vegetated areas due to the common mixture of urban and vegetated lands. A set of subclass land-cover information provided through this study is valuable to understand the degrees of spatial similarity for the global vegetated and urban-related classes in selected study areas.

Handan is a representative research area with distinct agricultural advantages and regional differences in land use, where the expansion of construction land has led to a rapid decrease of agricultural land in recent years. Natural factors (topography, climate, soil conditions, and vegetation cover) and socioeconomic factors (land use and spatial accessibility) were selected to establish a more comprehensive evaluation system. The index weight was calculated by the mutual information between index suitability and current land use. The consistency index was used to identify the boundary value dividing the overall suitability score into a suitable category and unsuitable category in each sub-region. The results demonstrated that the optimized WLC-ALSE model outperformed the comparison models using conventional methods in terms of the consistency between the evaluation results and current land use.

Subsequently, deep learning methods have been proven to be excellent in automating the mapping via semantic image segmentation. However, because deep neural networks require large amounts of labeled data, it is not easy to exploit the full potential of satellite imagery. Additionally, land cover tends to differ in appearance from one region to another; therefore, having labeled data from one location does not necessarily help map others. Furthermore, satellite images come in various multispectral bands, which range from RGB to over 12 bands. In this study, our aim is to use domain adaptation (DA) to solve the aforementioned problems.

Different social contexts create different mapping regimes and contribute to different conceptions of area classes. This likely creates challenges for the mapping process, including the consistency and comparability of the final product across time and space. In this study, part of the mapping process for the Norwegian land cover map called AR5 was followed. By seeing map classes as experiential categories, light is shed on the social construction of land cover/use maps. Different administrative units involved in the mapping process have different interpretations of area classes, even if the class definitions are the same. Local administrative units are closely influenced by the realities of local farmers and tend to map land use rather than land cover, even when they are instructed by the national mapping agency to map land cover. Such a difference challenges the comparability and consistency of maps (land cover vs. land use) when they are used in GIS to detect and monitor change. Alternatively, such co-operative map-making can be seen as an opportunity for the sharing and negotiation of power between the different management groups involved. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In both catchments, NPP, ET and NDVI showed a weak negative trend, while albedo showed a weak positive trend. Modelled land cover change was used to calculate future carbon storage and water use, with a decrease in catchment carbon storage and water use computed. Grassland, a dominant dormant land cover class, was targeted for land cover change by woody encroachment and afforestation, causing a decrease in albedo, while urbanisation and cultivation caused an increase in albedo.

Amazonia Legal has showed some declines in deforestation rates, but NW Amazonia has become one of the most recent/new hotspots of forest loss in the Amazon basin. Regional models of change are tools that support the analysis of causes and consequences in the dynamics of land use and are critical in the construction of scenarios for planning the future of the territory and conserving Amazonian forests. The neural networks implemented in the Terrset Land Change Modeler (LCM) module were used to predict and analyze the recent (2007-2016) and future business as usual (BAU2030) and two alternative scenarios for 2030 (PAST50_2030 AND TECH_2030) of the Colombian Amazon and prognostics for intact forests of the future. We used 5 main categories (forests, pastures, secondary vegetation, fragmented forests, and others) and grouped the main transitions of categories into three submodels of change (conversion to pastures, degradation and regeneration). The simulation foresees a substantial loss of forests in the business as usual scenario of 7.92% for 2030 (-3,387,898 ha), followed by a projected increase in pastures of 2,012,087 ha (52.5%) respectively. On the contrary the alternative scenarios show more reduced loss of forest for 2030 of 1,998,299 ha (4.6%) for the PAST50_2030 scenario and a 612,989 ha (1.4%) in the TECH_2030 scenario, accompanied of an increase of only 362,966 ha of pastures in the first case and a reduction of pastures of 316,705 ha in the TECH_2030 case. The most worrying projection is the reduction of intact forest from an average size of forest fragments of 5724 ha in 2016 to 1668 ha (BAU2030), 1744 ha (PAST50_2030) and a minor reduction to 2397 ha for the TECH_2030 scenario. There is also an increased isolation and a reduction of total forest core that only in the TECH_2030 scenario is less pronounced. The protection of those intact patches is key to the future of the NW Amazonia, the reduction in the rate of conversion to pastures PAST50_2030 indicates an opportunity to have a less dramatic loss of forest intact patches but the TECH_2030 scenario is where those areas remain less affected and connectivity will be less affected. These findings signal the urgent need to find mechanisms to implement effective planning in the region in order to prevent uncontrolled expansion, slow deforestation and fragmentation rates and to ensure the integrity of the protected areas and the connectivity of such key landscapes.

With the rapid development of urbanization, urban ecological and environmental issues have aroused widespread concern. The urban heat island (UHI) effect is a crucial problem, as its generation and evolution are closely related to social and economic activities. Land-use and land-cover change (LUCC) is the key in analyzing the UHI effect. Shanghai, one of China's major economic, financial and commercial centers, has experienced high development density for several decades. A tremendous amount of farmland and vegetation coverage has been replaced by an urban impervious surface, leading to an intensive SUHI effect, especially in the city's center. Luckily, the SUHI trend has slowed due to reasonable urban planning and relevant green policies since the 2010 Expo. Data analyses demonstrate that an impervious surface (IS) has a positive correlation with land surface temperature (LST) but a negative correlation with vegetation and water. Among the three factors, impervious surface is the most relevant. Therefore, the policy implications of land use and control of impervious surfaces should pay attention to the relief of the current SUHI effect in Shanghai.",surface urban heat island (SUHI),land-use and land-cover change (LUCC),land surface temperature (LST),Shanghai,NDVI,MNDWI,,"Li, Yu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our study attempts to solve this problem by generating a benchmark soil data through the development of modified spatial analogue (MSA) method in the context of the Upper Dijo River catchment, south-central Ethiopia. The magnitude and patterns of LULC changes were extracted from air photos and satellite imageries, along with the acquisition of soil samples from the reference and target sites through ground survey. Analysis of digital image processing shows significant LULC changes in a period that spanned three decades. The impact of LULC change on soil quality was assessed by comparing the soil physico-chemical properties sampled from the reference and target sites. The result shows a decline in total nitrogen, organic matter, available potassium and pH levels in soils collected from target sites, which conforms to results reported by studies conducted in data-rich environment. With careful validation, MSA could be useful for monitoring soil property changes in data-scarce environment and generate soil-related parameters for agro-ecological models.",Ethiopia,land-use/land-cover change,reference soils,data-scarce environment,soil quality change,modified spatial analogue method,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of IWSM and determine the land use and cover dynamics that it has induced. The change in land use and cover was assessed by integrating remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS). Two sets of aerial photographs (taken in 1965 and 1994 at scale of 1:50,000) and Landsat ETM+ image (taken in 2000 with 30 m resolution) were used to produce the land use/land cover map and assess land use change.The results reveal significant modification and conversion of land use and cover of the watershed over the last four decades (1965-2005). A significant portion of the watershed was continuously under intensively cultivated (tainted) land. The area under irrigation increased from 7 ha to 222.4 ha post-intervention. The area under dense forest increased from 32.4 ha to 98 ha.The study further shows that IWSM decreased soil erosion. increased soil moisture, reduced sedimentation and run off, set the scene for a number of positive knock-on effects Such as stabilization of gullies and river banks, rehabilitation of degraded lands. IWSM also resulted in increased recharge in the subsurface water.This study reconfirms the importance of IWSM as a key to improve the land cover of watersheds, as a contribution to poverty alleviation and sustainable livelihood.

Understanding the impacts of LUCC on the regional climate contributes to providing fundamental information for future land use planning and regional policy orientation, especially in extremely vulnerable and sensitive plateau regions. This study was designed to explore the regional climate effects associated with LUCC in the Lhasa River basin of Tibetan Plateau using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, with a particular focus on near-surface air temperature (T-a) and surface energy fluxes. Two numerical experiments (Case 1980 and Case 2015) were simulated, spanning from November 2014 to November 2015 with the first month as spin-up. The results indicated that the conversion from croplands or grass-lands to urban and built-up land led to a noticeable increase in T-a (0.23 degrees C) during summer. In areas converted from grasslands to waters, T-a decreased by 0.40 degrees C during spring and approximately 0.50 degrees C during winter. The afforestation activities at this scale had an obvious impact on the T-a in spring and winter, increasing by 0.20 degrees C and 0.10 degrees C, respectively. Generally, the latent heat flux (LE) and sensible heat flux (H) were more sensitive to land conversions, while changes in other fluxes seemed to be weaker. Due to the small change in net radiation (R-n) and ground heat flux (G), the H generally showed an opposite trend with that of LE. Urbanization and reservoir construction resulted in a decrease in the LE, while afforestation construction contributed to an increase in the LE. Our study highlights the impacts of current regional development in the plateau areas on the climate, especially in spring and winter. Urbanization led to a slight warming effect; the cooling effect was more significant in spring and winter than in summer after reservoir construction, and the current afforestation project contributed to a warming effect in winter. This study contributes to the future development of environmentally compatible and sustainable land strategies. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

They offer valuable information on the current state of the Earth's land surface. However, considerable disagreements among them and classification legends not primarily suited for specific applications such as carbon cycle model parameterizations pose significant challenges and uncertainties in the use of such data sets.This paper addresses the user community of global land cover products. We first review and compare several global land cover products, i.e. the Global Land Cover Characterization Database (GLCC), Global Land Cover 2000 (GLC2000), and the MODIS land cover product, and highlight individual strengths and weaknesses of mapping approaches. Our overall objective is to present a straightforward method that merges existing products into a desired classification legend. This process follows the idea of convergence of evidence and generates a 'best-estimate' data set using fuzzy agreement. We apply our method to develop a new joint I-km global land cover product (SYNMAP) with improved characteristics for land cover parameterization of the carbon cycle models that reduces land cover uncertainties in carbon budget calculations.The overall advantage of the SYNMAP legend is that all classes are properly defined in terms of plant functional type mixtures, which can be remotely sensed and include the definitions of leaf type and longevity for each class with a tree component. SYNMAP is currently used for parameterization in a European model intercomparison initiative of three global vegetation models: BIOME-BGC, LPJ, and ORCHIDEE.Corroboration of SYNMAP against GLCC, GLC2000 and MODIS land cover products reveals improved agreement of SYNMAP with all other land cover products and therefore indicates the successful exploration of synergies between the different products. However, given that we cannot provide extensive validation using reference data we are unable to prove that SYNMAP is actually more accurate. SYNMAP is available on request from Martin Jung.

The southern and western areas of the United States have experienced rapid population growth in the past decades. This paper analyzed the LULC change patterns and population dy-namics in Collin County, Texas from 2000 to 2019. Landsat images and population data from US Census were analyzed in this study. Supervised maximum likelihood classifier was used to obtain the pre-classified land cover maps. We interpreted the land cover classes for three sets of samples from multiple sources and used them as the input sample for post-classification. A CoMCRF based post-classification was further performed on each of the pre-classified land cover maps. The post -classification improved the overall accuracy (OA) from the pre-classification maps by 2.9%, 5.7%, and 6.6% for 2000, 2010, and 2019, respectively. The Kappa coefficients also increased by 0.044, 0.089, and 0.101 for the three study years. Based on the post-classified land cover maps, we found that the LULC change in Collin County, Texas is primarily in the form of converting field lands to human built land covers. Ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) were further employed to investigate the tract-level relationships between built-up area change ratio and population change ratio during the period from 2010 to 2019.

The past 300 years have witnessed a dramatic LUCC in China. The cropland area has increased by 67.11 million ha, while the forest and grassland areas have decreased by 127.96 million ha and 16.72 million ha, respectively.

Nevertheless, establishing a direct relationship between water quality and LULC is challenging due to the multi-indicator nature of both factors. Water quality encompasses a multitude of physical, chemical, and biological parameters, while LULC represents a diverse array of land use types. Riparian habitat quality (RHQ) serves as an indicator of LULC. Yet, it remains to be seen whether RHQ can act as a proxy of LULC for assessing the impact of LULC on riverine water quality. This study examines the interplay between RHQ, LULC and water quality, and develops a comprehensive indicator to predict water quality. We measured several water quality parameters, including pH (potential of hydrogen), TN (total nitrogen), TP (total phosphorus), Twater (water temperature), DO (dissolved oxygen), and EC (electrical conductivity) of the Yue and Jinshui Rivers draining to the Han River during 2016, 2017 and 2018. The water quality index (WQI) was further calculated. RHQ is assessed by the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) model. Our study found noticeable seasonal differences in water quality, with a higher WQI observed in the dry season. The RHQ was strongly correlated with LULC compositions. RHQ positively correlated with WQI, and DO concentration and vegetation land were negatively correlated with Twater, TN, TP, EC, cropland, and construction land. These correlations were stronger in the rainy season. Human-dominated land, such as construction land and cropland, significantly contributed to water quality degradation, whereas vegetation promoted water quality. Regression models showed that the RHQ explained variations in WQI better than LULC types.

We developed maps of ecological potential (EP) for shrub, sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), perennial herbaceous, litter, and bare ground fractional cover in Wyoming, USA. EP maps correspond to the potential natural vegetation cover expected by environmental conditions in the absence of anthropogenic and natural disturbance as represented by the greenest and least disturbed period of the Landsat archive. EP was predicted using regression tree models with inputs of soil maps and spectral data associated with the 75th percentile of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index in the Landsat archive. We trained our EP models with 2015 component cover maps on ecologically intact sites with relatively lower bare ground than expected. We generated departure of vegetation cover by comparing the EP and 2015 fractional cover. The departures represent land cover change from potential land cover and/or within-state changes in 2015. Next, we converted EP and 2015 fractional cover maps into thematic land cover and evaluated departure to determine if it was great enough to result in land cover change. The 2015 conditions showed reduced shrub, sagebrush, litter, and perennial herbaceous cover and increased bare ground relative to EP. Known disturbances, such as energy development, fires, and vegetation treatments, are clearly visible on the departure maps, but not on EP component maps. The most frequent departure from EP land cover was shrubland conversion to grassland. Land cover departures can be explained only in small part by known disturbance, and instead are ostensibly related to climate and land management practices. These drivers result in land cover departures that broadened the ecotone between shrubland and grassland relative to EP. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

This study aims to generate a land use and land cover map of the Chennai Basin for the cropping season of Rabi 2015/16 and to assess the influence of combining the new ESA Copernicus satellites Sentinel-1 and -2 on classification accuracies. A Random Forest based wrapper approach was applied to select the most relevant radar (Sentinel-1) images for the combination with the optical (Sentinel-2) data. Area proportion weighted accuracy with 95% confidence interval were estimated for the Random Forest models, which differentiated 13 land cover classes. The highest overall accuracy of 91.53% +/- 0.89 pp was achieved with a combination of 1 Sentinel-2 and 8 Sentinel-1 scenes. This is an improvement of 5.68 pp over a classification with Sentinel-2 data only. An addition of further Sentinel-1 scenes showed no improvement in overall accuracy. The strongest improvement in class-specific accuracy was achieved for paddy fields. This study shows for the first time how land use and land cover classifications in cloud-prone monsoon regions with small-scale agriculture and multiple cropping patterns can be improved by combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data.",Sentinel-1,Sentinel-2,Random forest,Multi-sensory,SAR,Land use and land cover classification,Cloud-prone,"Waske, Bjoern",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,India,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the challenges of predicting long-term changes in human behaviors and activities, scenarios provide a framework for simulating the long-term consequences of land-cover change on ecosystem function. As input for process-based models of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem function, we developed scenarios for land cover, population density, and impervious cover for the state of New Hampshire for 2020-2100. Key drivers of change were identified through information gathered from six sources: historical trends, existing plans relating to New Hampshire's land-cover future, surveys, existing population scenarios, key informant interviews with diverse stakeholders, and input from subject-matter experts. Scenarios were developed in parallel with information gathering, with details added iteratively as new questions emerged. The final scenarios span a continuum from spatially dispersed development with a low value placed on ecosystem services (Backyard Amenities) to concentrated development with a high value placed on ecosystem services (the Community Amenities family). The Community family includes two population scenarios (Large Community and Small Community), to be combined with two scenarios for land cover (Protection of Wildlands and Promotion of Local Food), producing combinations that bring the total number of scenarios to six. Between Backyard Amenities and Community Amenities is a scenario based on linear extrapolations of current trends (Linear Trends).

Therefore, it is crucial to examine how these changes in climate and LULC will impact future hydrological responses, especially considering the growing water demand and agricultural activities. In this study, we first investigated the future climatic conditions of the Minab River Basin, Iran, by considering three CMIP6 scenarios (i.e., SSP1-2.6, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios) from the CanESM5 model during 2021-2050 and 2051-2080. Next, the LULC maps of the watershed during 2035 and 2065 were projected, and the individual and combined impacts of LULC and climate on streamflow and evapotranspiration (ET) of the basin were evaluated using the SWAT model. The future precipitation and minimum and maximum temperature of the region were projected to increase up to 88%, 21%, and 12%, respectively, compared to the baseline period (1989-2014). According to our findings, it is projected that future alterations in climate and LULC will lead to a rise in evapotranspiration (ET), with potential increases of up to 12.8% solely due to climate changes and 2-6% attributable to LULC changes compared to the baseline period. Furthermore, the changes in LULC are expected to cause a decline in streamflow ranging from 2-11%. The impact of climate on streamflow, however, exhibited temporal variations and was influenced by the severity of future warming, resulting in diverse impacts across different climate scenarios.

The Yellow River Basin is a vast geographical unit integrating fragile ecosystems and crucial socio-economic systems, in which development and conservation have coexisted and coevolved over decades. Here, we explored the evolution characteristics of land use/land cover (LULC) changes from 2000 to 2020 and predicted the future changes in 2030. On this basis, the ecosystem services were assessed and predicted correspondingly on established grids, administrative divisions, and the basin. Analyses show remarkable progress in reforestation and water protection and great challenges of grassland protection. Cropland keeps declining at a reduced change rate from 1.7% to 0.7%, with its developed and occupied rates intensifying. Grassland degradation and transition are increasingly severe, with its reduction rate doubling in the second decade. Large-scale and repeated conversions between cropland and grassland indicate their spatial conflicts in the upstream fragile zone but fail to be mitigated by existing policies. Land use intensifies over time and successively from upstream to downstream in space, with construction land increasing by 23.2% and 68.2% in the past two decades, respectively. Based on predictions by the Patch-generating Land Use Simulation model, we found higher risks of downstream cropland loss and grassland degradation in 2030. Construction land was estimated to increase dramatically by 34.5%. The basin's total value of ecosystem services (ESV) was estimated to increase by 13.87 billion CNY during 2000-2010 and decrease by 5.27 billion CNY during 2010-2020, likely to reduce by 5.40 billion CNY in 2030.

However, little effort has been made to investigate the impacts of watershed management on land use/cover changes and landscape greenness. Thus, this study was conducted to assess the long-term impacts of watershed management on land use/cover changes and landscape greenness in the Yezat watershed. Landsat images for 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2021 were employed and analyzed to produce maps of the respective years using GIS and remote sensing techniques. Data from satellite images, coupled with field observation and the socio-economic survey, revealed an effective approach for analyzing the extent, rate, and spatial patterns of land use/cover changes. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was also employed to detect vegetation greenness. The results of the study show that between 1990 and 2021, the built-up area, plantation, natural forest, shrubland, and grasslands were increased by + 254 ha, + 712.3 ha, 196.3 ha, + 1070.8, and + 425.3 ha respectively due to watershed management interventions. Conversely, cultivated land was decreased with a rate of - 2658.7 ha(,) in the study area. However, the reverse is true between 1990 and 2000 due to large-scale land degradation. Besides, the result of the study also shows that a low landscape greenness value (- 0.11) was observed between 1990 and 2000, and a high landscape greenness value (+ 0.2) was observed between 1990 and 2021. The observed change in landscape greenness in the watershed was due to the change in shrubland (+ 1070.8 ha), grassland (+ 425.3 ha), plantation (+ 712.3 ha), and forestland (+ 196.3 ha) covers between 1990 and 2021 years. Such observed changes in land use land covers, landscape greenness, and cultivated land in the study watershed have important implications for the improvement of soil moisture, soil fertility, biodiversity, groundwater recharge, carbon sequestration, soil erosion land, crop yield, and ecosystem services.",Land use,land cover change,Landscape greenness,Landsat,Satellite images,Watershed,Watershed management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such information is essential for a better understanding of the sustainability of urban development processes, both planned and unplanned. We therefore investigated the changes in land use and land cover of 11 residential areas in Merseyside, UK, using aerial photographs taken in 1975 and 2000. We then modeled how these changes would alter three important environmental parameters: surface temperature, runoff of rainfall, and greenspace diversity. These changes were then related to the socio-economic status of the areas, as measured by an index of multiple deprivation. The comparisons revealed a loss of greenspace in all 11 case study sites Overall, the more affluent, low density areas lost more greenspace, especially of tree cover. A major cause was infill development whereby gardens were built over. However, greenspace was also lost in already densely built-up, deprived areas due to the reuse of derelict land. As a consequence, the models used in this study predicted negative environmental impacts for all areas. The results emphasize the need to critically review concepts such as urban densification and give more weight to the preservation and management of urban greenspaces. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The goal of this paper is to investigate and evaluates the use of LiDAR data only (range and intensity data) to extract land cover information. Different bands generated from the LiDAR data (Normal Heights, Intensity Texture, Surfaces Slopes, and PCA) are combined with the original data to study the influence of including these layers on the classification accuracy.

However, analysis of land use has not developed with the same speed as development of new satellite sensors and available land cover data. Improvement of land use analysis is possible, but more advanced methods are needed which make it possible to link image data to analysis of land use functions. To make this linking possible, variable which affect farmer's long term decisions must be taken into account in analysis as well as the relative importance of the landscape itself.A GIS-based tool for the measurement of local spatial context in satellite data is presented in this paper and used to explore the relationship between land covers present in satellite data and land use represented in official databases. By the use of the developed tool, a land configuration image (LCI) over the Siljan area in northern Sweden was produced and used for analysis. The results are twofold. First, the produced LCI holds new information about variables that are relevant for the interpretation of land use. Second, the comparison with statistics of agricultural production shows that production in the study area varies depending on the relative land configuration. Villages consisting of relatively large-scale arable fields and less diverse landscape are less diverse in production than villages which consist of smaller-scale and more heterogonous landscapes. The result is especially relevant for land use studies and policymakers working on environmental and agricultural policies. We conclude that local spatial context is an endogenous variable in the relation between landscape configuration and agricultural land use. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

For the sea level rise scenarios of 1 m and 2 m, the total inundation zones were estimated to be 169.11 km(2) and 598.83 km(2) respectively using Geographic Information System (GIS). The losses of urban areas were estimated at 43 km(2) and 187 km(2) for the 1 m and 2 m sea level rise respectively which is alarming information for the most densely populated state of India. Quantitative comparison of other LU/LC classes showed significant changes under each of the inundation scenarios. The results obtained conclusively point that sea level rise scenarios will bring profound effects on the land use and land cover classes as well as on coastal landforms in the study region. Coastal inundation would leave ocean front and inland properties vulnerable. Increase in these water levels would alter the coastal drainage gradients. Reduction in these gradients would increase flooding attributable to rainstorms which could promote salt water intrusion into coastal aquifers and force water tables to rise. Changes in the coastal landforms associated with inundation generate concern in the background that the coastal region may continue to remain vulnerable in the coming decades due to population growth and development pressures.

It is concluded that the vegetation data in the map are not likely to be reflecting an extreme situation due to the LID event.

In the present study, we used the national Land Cover (LC) dataset, named ArealStatistik, produced by the Federal Statistical Office, to explore the spatiotemporal patterns of Land Cover in Switzerland, providing a comprehensive assessment of land cover change at the national scale. Results indicate that, in general, Switzerland has undergone small, spatially dispersed, dynamic, and gradual change trends, with high rates of transition between low growing Brush Vegetation and forest LC classes in recent years. These pixel-level trends are more important in the lower altitude plateau and Jura regions, while greater changes in the spatial configuration of LC are observed in the alpine regions. However, findings also suggest that identifying drivers and understanding the rate of change are limited by the spatial resolution and temporal update frequency of the ArealStatistik.

To understand and predict the land abandonment process and its consequences, land cover change models are used. An essential step in the development of a land cover change model is the identification and quantification of the factors controlling land cover change. In this paper we present a change detection study using aerial photographs in combination with an extensive dataset of field data and geographical data, to identify and quantify these factors for a study area in Mediterranean France, 60 km west of the city of Montpellier. We distinguished 11 land cover change classes and 7 associated ""time since abandonment"" classes at a detailed scale. Several environmental and non-environmental factors were found to be important variables for the land abandonment process. Differences in soil class explain a large part of the land abandonment pattern and the associated transition paths and transition rates. Most abandoned lands are located on regosols and lithosols, which are marginal soils with respect to water holding capacity. Within soil classes, we could recognise different transition paths and transition rates. However, within the 55 years covered by this dataset detailed transitions from pioneer vegetation to vegetation higher in the succession, as described by other authors, were only found for a limited number of vegetation/soil combinations.

The Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellite data of January and September of the years 1991, 2001, 2011 and 2016 was used to study the impact of LULC changes on LST and its effect on crop yield (rice and wheat) in SBS Nagar, Ludhiana and Bathinda districts representing three different agro-climatic zones of Punjab (India). The Landsat satellite imageries were classified for the major LULC classes (water, vegetation [including agriculture and forest], built-up and bare soil) in each district using different spectral indices. The results showed that vegetation is the key land provider for built-up development in SBS Nagar and Ludhiana districts, whereas bare soil and water bodies were the main contributor of land for expansion of built-up and vegetation over the years in Bathinda district. Compared with 1991, the surface temperature of all the land cover features has increased over the years and the increase in temperature was higher for built-up features. Among different districts, the rate of increase was highest in Ludhiana district due to higher urban sprawl. The increase in temperature was higher in the direction where land use has been changed from agriculture, bare soil and forest to urban. The air temperature in agro-climatic regions of Punjab can be estimated from LST by multiplying it with a factor of 0.86. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was significantly positively correlated with rice and wheat yield, but significantly negatively correlated with LST.

This study utilized field observations, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews as crucial data collection tools for socioeconomic analysis.

Forest cover was increased by 210% in the district's study year, with the highest conversion rate of 15.1% from cultivated land to forest land in the overall study period. As a result, Acacia decurrens forestation is the main cause of the change of use from arable land to forest land systems. This tree plantation-based land use is also the main driving force behind shifting crop farming to tree plantation-based livelihoods because it increases economic benefits and employment opportunities, reduces soil erosion, and increases soil productivity in the area. To limit the negative consequences and raise the beneficial effects of tree plantations, systematic management of tree-based land use systems, integrated advanced land resource management, and increased economic and environmental benefits are suggested for the district.",Acacia decurrens,GIS and remote sensing,Land use change,Tree plantations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We collated land condition data from 2282 sites evaluated between 2004 and 2018 in the Burdekin and Fitzroy regions of Queensland. Condition was defined using the Grazing Land Management land condition framework that ranks grazing land condition on a four point ordinal scale based on dimensions of vegetation composition, ground cover level and erosion severity. Nine separate ground cover derived indices were then calculated for each site. We found that all indices significantly correlated with grazing land condition on corresponding sites. Highest correlations occurred with indices that benchmarked ground cover at the site against regional ground cover assessed over several years. These findings provide some validation for the general use of ground cover data as an indicator of rangeland health/productivity. We also constructed univariate land condition models with a subset of these indices. Our models predicted land condition significantly better than random assignment though only moderately well; no model correctly predicted land condition class on >40% of sites. While the best models predicted condition correctly at >60% of A and D condition sites, condition at sites in B and C condition sites was poorly predicted. Several factors limit how well ground cover levels predict land condition. The main challenge is modelling a multidimensional value (grazing land condition) with a unidimensional ground cover measurement.

In this paper we describe refinements and improvements, in both the algorithm and the resulting map data sets, that have been implemented in the MODIS Collection 6 Global land Cover Type product. Unlike the Collection 5 product, which was based on the 17-class International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) legend, the Collection 6 algorithm uses a hierarchical classification model where the classes included in each level of the hierarchy reflect structured distinctions between land cover properties. The resulting suite of nested classifications is combined to create eight distinct classification schemes including the five legacy schemes included in Collection 5, and three new legends based on the FAO-Land Cover Classification System (LEGS) that distinguish between land cover, land use, and surface hydrologic state. The Collection 6 algorithm also incorporates a state-space multitemporal modeling framework based on hidden Markov models that reduce spurious land cover changes introduced by classification uncertainty in individual years. Among other changes, relative to Collection 5, the Collection 6 product includes less area mapped as forests, open shrublands, and cropland/natural vegetation mosaics, and more area mapped as woodlands and grasslands.

Plant health and the exchange of energy, water, and biogeochemical components at the surface interface are partly controlled by soil properties. Different soil types modify vegetation responses to existing climate forcings, and each soil type also responds differently to the same land-use practice. Currently, Earth system models often use single soil columns with averaged properties. This leads to uncertainties in assessing LULC impacts. To improve the estimates of land surface change in Earth System Models, we link an existing LULC data set to four hydrologic soil groups from 850 to 2015, based on demonstrated soil preferences for eight LULCs under current conditions. We conclude that humans prefer hydrologic soil groups in order from B, D, C, to A. This ranking was applied to construct the history of LULC on each soil type at the 0.5 degrees grid resolution. Results primarily distribute croplands to hydrologic soil group B in 850, while hydrologic soil group A has the most undisturbed area. Over time, good soils (hydrologic soil groups B and D) experience increased use for cropland areas, while poor soils (hydrologic soil groups C and A) are occupied predominantly by increasing areas in grazing land and secondary nonforests.

An understanding of the factors responsible for land change trajectories is fundamental for land-use planning and the development of land-related policies. The aims of this study were to characterize and identify the spatial determinants of agricultural land-cover change trajectories in northern Ghana. Land-cover change trajectories were defined using land-cover maps prepared from Landsat Thematic Mapper dataset acquired in 1984, 1992, and 1999. Binary logistic regression was used to model the probability of observing the trajectories as a function of spatially explicit biophysical and socioeconomic independent variables. Population densities generally increased along the continuum of land-use intensity, whereas distance from market and roads generally decreased along this continuum. Apparently, roads and market serve as incentives for settlement and agricultural land use. An increase in population density is an important spatial determinant only for trajectories where the dominant change process is agricultural extensification. A major response to population growth is an increase in cultivation frequency around the main market. Agricultural intensification is highly sensitive to accessibility by roads. The increase in land-use intensity is also associated with low soil quality. These results suggest the need for policies to restore soil fertility for agricultural sustainability.

We analyzed the long-term spatial distribution of four basic land cover classes to test if the 'compact growth' observed up to early 1990s and the 'sprawl' observed afterwards differently affect LCRs. Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis and multivariate procedures were used to verify this hypothesis. Results put in evidence similarities and differences in Land Cover Changes (LCCs) and LCRs observed during the two urban phases. Per-capita built-up area was found significantly higher in the 'sprawl' than in 'compact growth' phase. Cropland was the land cover class with the highest probability to undergo edification in both periods, but a significant conversion rate from forests towards cropland and pastures (in turn converted into built-up areas) was also observed in the 'sprawl' phase. This may be considered an indirect effect of urbanization due to sprawl-driven land fragmentation and recurrent fires induced by illegal housing and land speculation. We finally discussed how the changing LCRs may represent, at regional scale, a possible target for policies mitigating land consumption in 'shrinking' Mediterranean cities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The efficiency of the proposed approach was examined using LULC data for the Dakshina Kannada District of Karnataka State, India. The proposed model achieved an overall accuracy of 95.11% and a kappa coefficient of 0.92, based on the ground-truth data for 2014. The model's predictions for 2035, based on data from 2005 to 2014, revealed the following trends: Urbanization exhibited a pattern of rapid expansion and increased growth. The integrated CNN-LSTM model extracted spatial and temporal features for effectively predicting LULC changes. Infrastructure development, population density, and enhanced economic activities were the major driving factors of changes in LULC for the study region. Robust LULC change forecasting will strengthen LULC evaluations, aid in understanding complex land-use systems, and empower decision-makers to formulate effective land management strategies in the coming years.",Predictive models,Convolutional neural networks,Data models,Training,Remote sensing,Crops,Land surface,"Venkatesan, M.","Rajan, Jeny",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Deep learning (DL),hybrid convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-long short-term memory network (LSTM),,,,,,land use and land cover (LULC),prediction,,,

Together with the increase of these mapping activities, the need for standardizing land cover classification schemes for maps has been emphasized. In 2000, FAO published a widely accepted land cover classification system based on priori (pre-decided) approach, which can be applied to any area of the world. This study examined land cover features of the geographically diverse state of Queensland, Australia, with a special emphasis on dynamic land cover differences, and applied fundamentals of FAO LCCS to classify land cover of two different regions. These two regions; 1) the arid Mt. Isa region in northern Queensland; and 2) the urbanized southeast region including Brisbane and the Gold Coast, cover a diversity of landscape types. The combination of these regions is representative of a large portion of other regions of the Australian continent. Improving the resolution of national land cover maps is of a national priority as it required to address a wide range of environmental and natural resource issues. Classifications were conducted on SPOT 10m satellite data, supported by 2.5m high resolution SPOT true colour images, ASTER, and some Landsat scenes. Other GIS data layers including SLATS 2001-2003 (Statewide Land cover and Trees Study) data and extensive field survey information collected from both areas were also utilized. Both regions were classified initially into three levels (dichotomous phase) of the FAO LCCS and then spectral features, field investigations, and other image attributes were used to generate 4th level (Modular-Hierarchical phase) land cover categories. Results show a very satisfactory land cover map at 10m resolution compared to existing land cover products. The standard FAO classification scheme provides a standardised system of classification that can be used to analyse spatial and temporal land cover variability throughout the country. This approach also has the advantage of facilitating the integration of Australian land cover mapping products with global land cover datasets.",Land cover,Landsat TM,FAO LCCS,Priori classification,Dichotomous approach,Land cover classifiers,,"Apan, Armando","McDougall, Kevin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NETWORKING THE WORLD WITH REMOTE SENSING,,,,,,,,,,,,

Revealing the driving mechanism behind urban land use change facilitates deeper insight into the human and biophysical effects in the urbanization process and thereby supports the sustainable urban development. This work proposed a marginbased measure of random forest for core driving factor identification of urban land use change, which mainly included urban vegetation change, constructed land, water bodies, etc., using multitemporal global land cover products and point-of-interest (POI) data. Taking the land use change in Wuhan from 2010 to 2020 as the case study, the proposed method was employed to measure and sort the driving forces of 24 biophysical and human factors. The results suggested that the margin-based method was more reliable and sensitive than the traditional importance measure of random forest when detecting the driving mechanism behind land use change. Meanwhile, both the importance values and the ranking orders of driving factors measured by the margin-based method were stable regardless of which similarity measure was chosen and applied. The findings also showed that topographic conditions persistently affected urban land use change, while transportation factors, instead of business services, gradually became the most important human driving factors in Wuhan in the last 10 years.",Driving factor,Land use change,Global land cover products,Point of interest,Random forest,,,"Song, Danxia","Li, Yan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We represent a first attempt to specify the relationship between LULC change and dryness in a region of Vietnam that is profoundly affected by climate change. Using the temperature-vegetation dryness index (TVDI), we specified the relationships and changes underway in Vietnam's Ba river basin, one of the largest river systems in the South Central Coast. Using Google Earth Engine, we extracted land use data from Landsat images and calculated TVDI values from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for 2000 to 2019. We found, first, that agricultural area and deforestation rose by 7.2% and 2.4% annually, respectively. These changes were driven by economic development, rising crop prices, illegal logging, wildfires, and emergence of new agricultural areas. Second, areas classified in the driest TVDI intervals (dry and very dry) occupied 57% of the basin in 2019, 70% of which was agricultural lands and 20% other (mainly urban and bare lands). These driest land categories expanded at an average rate of 0.08% to 0.1% per year. Moreover, 90% of areas classified as ""very wet"" and ""wet"" were forest. We observed a strong relationship between LULC change and TVDI. Climate change and LULC change thus appear to be propelling the basin's climate toward increasing dryness, suggesting the need for policies to reduce the agricultural area and expand forests while developing more adaptive and sustainable livelihoods.

Considering spiking population and carbon emission trends, especially in metropolitan cities of developing countries, such estimations are direly needed. Moreover, quantification and empirical evidence involving such a multidisciplinary analysis are rarely available. Therefore, this study would help in understanding the relationship among economic development, carbon emissions, carbon sinks and land use change in BMA. CO2 emission and sequestration data from 1987 to 2015 were collected, and the changes and rate of change in LCLU were assessed by analyzing landsat satellite images of 1987, 1995, 2005, and 2015. Best efforts were put to attain net gains and losses in carbon sources and sinks analyses. Results showed that carbon sources have increased by almost 4-folds from 1987 to 2015 while sinks have declined rapidly to half of its original amount since 1987. The gap between carbon sources and sinks is widening year by year and will, if it continues in this manner cover up the whole green space of BMA in the next decade. The LCLU change results also verified and showed the same results, which helped in validating such outcomes. Urban/built up area sprawl over 60% of BMA's area while the remaining 40% constitutes agricultural land, green spaces, and water bodies. Furthermore, the rate of change of urban area was 157.4 sq km during 2005-2015 and 218 sq km during 1995-2005. Therefore, policy makers of BMA should seriously draft expansion plans of green spaces and public parks and implement it immediately to tackle with carbon emissions and land use change disquiets.

Mapping and classification for the year 2012 were made by visual interpretation of images obtained from the RapidEye satellite, which has a 5 m spatial resolution. In this work, we identified nine classes of land use and land cover. From the hydrography vectors it was possible to determinate the Permanent Preservation Areas of the bodies of water according to the environmental legislation. Analysis of misuse in the PPAs was made by crossingchecking the land use and land cover data with that of the PPAs.

The discussed phenomenon involves land development, mainly agricultural land, in the proximity of cities, the development of infrastructure, and an increase in the number of residents who rely on urban services and commute to work in the city. Urban sprawl generates numerous problems which, in the broadest sense, result from the difficulty in identifying the boundaries of the central urban unit and the participation of local inhabitants, regardless of their actual place of residence, in that unit's functional costs. These problems are associated not only with tax collection rights but with difficulties in measuring the extent of urban sprawl in research and local governance. The aim of this study was to analyze the applicability of the CORINE Land Cover (CLC) database for monitoring urbanization processes, including the dynamic process of urban sprawl. Polish cities with county rights, i.e., cities that implement independent spatial planning policies, were analyzed in the study to determine the pattern of urban sprawl in various types of cities. Buffer zones composed of municipalities that are directly adjacent to the central urban unit were mapped around the analyzed cities. The study proposes a novel method for measuring the extent of suburbanization with the use of the CLC database and Geographic Information System (GIS) tools. The developed method relies on the overgrowth of urbanization (OU) index calculated based on CLC data. The OU index revealed differences in the rate of urbanization in three groups of differently sized Polish cities. The analysis covered two periods: 2006-2012 and 2012-2018, and it revealed that urban sprawl in the examined cities proceeded in an unstable manner over time.

Mitchell",Vegetation change and land tenure in Mexico: A country-wide analysis,LAND USE POLICY,JAN 2013,65,"There is an ongoing debate on the effect different property regimes have on the use of natural resources and land conversion (i.e., deforestation or reforestation). Much of the discussion has been centered on the two main forms of tenure regime: common-pool system and private property. Case studies around the world have provided evidence on whether one is more effective at preventing deforestation than the other, but there is not a clear pattern. Part of the problem is that evidence comes from theoretical models or isolated case studies instead of comparative studies across large areas. This paper helps to fill this gap by analyzing the association between land cover change (2001-2010) and land tenure regimes including private and two types of common-pool systems (communal and ejido) in Mexico at the municipality level. The analyses were conducted for each of the four major biomes (i.e., moist forest, dry forest, coniferous forest, and desert) to control for differences in environmental factors. Municipalities dominated by communal land tenure had the largest increase in woody cover (classified as >80% cover) in the moist forest, dry forest, and coniferous forest biomes, and municipalities classified as private also had an increase in woody cover, particularly in the desert biome. In contrast, municipalities classified as ejidos (common-pool tenure system resulting from the land reform) lost woody cover mostly in moist forest and desert biomes, but gained woody cover in dry forest and coniferous forest biomes. In modeling analyses, environmental variables were the most important variables associated with woody cover change for private and most communal municipalities, while socioeconomic variables were the most important in ejido regimes. These results highlight the importance of land tenure on land cover change, and show that differences in woody cover change between types of common-pool systems can be larger than their differences with private land tenure. During the last 10 years, virtually all deforestation has occurred in areas dominated by ejidos; in contrast, communal and private regimes seem to ameliorate the deforestation process.

Identifying the impacts of LULC changes on future terrestrial GPP has been challenging due to the scarcity of standardized future LULC for ecosystem models. Here, we present eight scenario-based projections of global spatially explicit LULC at 1-km resolution over the period 2015-2100 with a Future Land Use Simulation model-consistent with the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways and Representative Concentration Pathways. Twenty computational experiments with different LULC patterns, climate forcing, and CO2 concentrations were conducted to quantify their contributions to future GPP dynamics. Results show that the global terrestrial GPP would decline in the 21st century in most LULC scenarios due to urbanization, agricultural expansion, and deforestation. Moreover, the contribution of LULC changes to global GPP dynamics ranges from 3.43% to 10.78% when CO2 fertilization effect (CFE) is not modeled during 2000-2100 (7%-9% of the terrestrial area is dominated by LULC change). However, this value may range from 10.92% to 16.16% during 2000-2050 and 1.41%-14.57% during 2050-2100.

Understanding ET is important in quantifying the impacts of human influences on the hydrological cycle and thus helps improving water use efficiency and strengthening water use planning and watershed management. China has experienced tremendous land use and land cover changes (LUCC) as a result of urbanization and ecological restoration under a broad background of climate change. This study used MODIS data products to analyze how LUCC and climate change affected ET in China in the period 2001-2013. We examined the separate contribution to the estimated ET changes by combining LUCC and climate data. Results showed that the average annual ET in China decreased at a rate of -0.6 mm/yr from 2001 to 2013. Areas in which ET decreased significantly were mainly distributed in the northwest China, the central of southwest China, and most regions of south central and east China. The trends of four climatic factors including air temperature, wind speed, sunshine duration, and relative humiditywere determined, while the contributions of these four factors to ETwere quantified by combining the ET and climate datasets. Among the four climatic factors, sunshine duration and wind speed had the greatest influence on ET. LUCC data from 2001 to 2013 showed that forests, grasslands and croplands in China mutually replaced each other. The reduction of forests hadmuch greater effects on ET than change by other land cover types. Finally, through quantitative separation of the distinct effects of climate change and LUCC on ET, we conclude that climate change was the more significant than LULC change in influencing ET in China during the period 2001-2013. Effective water resource management and vegetation-based ecological restoration efforts in China must consider the effects of climate change on ET and water availability. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We use the Driscoll and Kraay standard errors fixed effects model to investigate the relationship between rural laborers' off-farm employment and agricultural land use efficiency based on a panel data of 1961 counties in China. We find that the distribution of county-level agricultural land use efficiency is heavily skewed to the right, with many counties below the national average efficiency level. We also identify a robust U-shaped relationship between off-farm employment and the change in agricultural land use efficiency, indicating that the substitution effect of capital and technology for rural labor has changed from weak to strong.

We show that by classifying each pixel in a satellite image into a number of LULC categories we are able to successfully produce LULC maps.

Standard image interpretation principles were employed, approximately 15% of the sample points were re-examined during the survey, and approximately 4.4% of the sample points were examined as part of an accuracy assessment after the survey was conducted. In addition to an assessment of land area occupied by the 13 major land classes and their subclasses, confidence intervals for these estimates were developed, and annual rates of management activity were estimated. Increases in the human living and commerce space of the southern landscape were observed to be mainly at the expense of tree covered ecosystems (generally exclusive of woodlands in Texas and Oklahoma), cropland, and pasture areas. Developed areas represented nearly 1.5% of the South in 2013, and transportation areas represented about 1.6%. Each gained land from the other land use classes over the study period. Estimates of tree cover, about 42%, were consistent with previous reports that estimated it to range from about 41 to 46% over the last six decades.

The LULC change analysis was performed by computer-aided visual interpretation for 5 years (1965, 1989, 2000, 2006 and 2014) using satellite imagery from LANDSAT MSS, TM, ETM and 8, ASTER and SPOTS. National topographic maps were also used for the 1965 and 2000 years.To adequately represent the LULC features and peculiarities of central Vietnam coastal areas, an adapted CORINE Land Cover nomenclature was used where new 3rd and 4th level classes were adopted. Due to their intrinsic relative high spatial and radiometric resolution, SPOTS images from 2006 were assumed as a reference for interpretation keys and first delineation. Changes were mapped by editing those vectors representing features which underwent LULC change prior or after 2006. Spatial and temporal changes were analyzed by post-classification approach and validated by ground truth information. High detail object-based classification was finally performed to infer the capability of medium spatial resolution imagery for extracting cadastral scale pond maps. The accuracy of classification was checked by a polygon by polygon comparison with an existing aquaculture facility inventory.Five LULC maps were obtained by applying a legend of 21 classes including two newly defined: ""Aquaculture ponds"" and ""Mangrove forest"". The overall classification accuracy of the LULC map is 85% while the KHAT statistics 0.81 for the year 2006. Accuracy of the object-based aquaculture facilities classification is 84% or better for the SPOTS imagery and 47.9% for the ASTER imagery. The study provides a synoptic LULC representation for the largest lagoon system of Southeast Asia and delivers quantitative estimates of main changes occurred during the last 50 years. Moreover, it reveals the adaptability of the CORINE Land Cover method outside European environment. Finally, SPOTS provides good results to map aquaculture features at cadastral scale, even if in some circumstances (e.g. tidal areas), the integration with higher spatial resolution multispectral sensors should be envisaged.

The 'Grain for Green Program' project has been implemented to address issues caused by vegetation degradation. Human beings play a key moderating role between drought and vegetation; however, it is not clearly understood how typical land cover changes from human activities impact the ability of vegetation to resist drought. To represent meteorological drought and vegetation dynamics, this study applied the standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence. We investigated the vegetation response relationship to drought and how changing land cover affected it. The land cover changes associated with strategic human activity were also analyzed using the response relationship and environmental characteristics. Our results showed that land cover changes contributed to abnormal changes in vegetation dynamics and type. From 2001 to 2016, meteorological drought showed an insignificant difference in Loess Plateau. To a certain extent, land cover changes could extend vegetation response time with the implementation of the 'Grain for Green Progam'. Response time to the drought of different vegetation types in both changed and unchanged land cover showed an increasing trend from early-period to later-period. Similar response time to drought was among cropland, forest, grassland, construction land, and desert of unchanged land cover vegetation in different Grain for Green periods. Forest cover effectively improved vegetation response time and reduced vulnerability.

This study examines changes in surface runoff generation and soil erosion in response to the LULC dynamics. To simulate runoff and sediment yield, the geographic information system-interfaced Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used. Model sensitivity, calibration and validation analyses were carried out, and the efficiency of the model was evaluated using simulated and measured discharge data. The two scenario model simulation goodness-of-fit measures verified that the SWAT model performed very well during calibration and validation periods for daily and monthly time steps (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency>079 and root mean square error-observation standard deviation ratio<04). Although the computed values of per cent bias fulfilled a satisfactory standard (greater than -118%), the model results tended to overestimate discharge. Consequent to the LULC change, an overall increase in the amount of surface runoff (142%) and sediment yield (37%) was observed relative to the baseline (1973) simulation scenario. Mean annual soil loss rate was estimated at 242Mgha(-1)y(-1). Nearly 952% of the watershed is experiencing moderate to severe soil loss rates ranging from 147 to 375Mgha(-1)y(-1). In the remaining parts of the watershed, soil loss rates range from 44 to 147Mgha(-1)y(-1). Surface runoff generation and soil erosion varied widely by soil, LULC types and slope positions. The observed environmental change would lead to further land degradation, with negative implications on the livelihoods of local people unless appropriate conservation measures are implemented.

To compare the watershed-size influence, this analysis was performed at two different spatial scales represented by two Uruguayan basins of different sizes, San Salvador (3,118 km2) and Del Tala (160 km2). Partial Least Squares and Random Forest unsupervised machine-learning models were employed for this analysis. By exploiting a non-model-biased method based on game theory (SHAP), the LULC characteristics were quantified and ranked based on their level of importance in the water-quality evaluation. The main outcomes of this study proved that patch density is one of the most influencing metrics in both watersheds and for both models.

They are considered to be most obvious quantitative method in the analysis of Land Use Land Cover (LULC) changes which provides from - to change information. But, the performance of post-classification comparison approaches highly depends on the accuracy of classification of individual images used for comparison. Hence, we present a classification approach that produce accurate classified results which aids to obtain improved change detection results. Machine learning is a part of broader framework in change detection, where neural networks have drawn much attention. Neural network algorithms adaptively estimate continuous functions from input data without mathematical representation of output dependence on input. A common practice for classification is to use Multi-Layer-Perceptron (MLP) neural network with backpropogation learning algorithm for prediction. To increase the ability of learning and prediction, multiple inputs (spectral, texture, topography, and multi-temporal information) are generally stacked to incorporate diversity of information. On the other hand literatures claims backpropagation algorithm to exhibit weak and unstable learning in use of multiple inputs, while dealing with complex datasets characterized by mixed uncertainty levels. To address the problem of learning complex information, we propose an ensemble classification technique that incorporates multiple inputs for classification unlike traditional stacking of multiple input data.In this paper, we present an Endorsement Theory based ensemble classification that integrates multiple information, in terms of prediction probabilities, to produce final classification results. Three different input datasets are used in this study: spectral, texture and indices, from SPOT-4 multispectral imagery captured on 1998 and 2003. Each SPOT image is classified individually to produce the classified output and used for comparison. A MLP is trained with the input datasets separately using a backpropagation learning algorithm and prediction probabilities are produced for each pixel as evidence against each LU/LC class. An integration rule based on Endorsement Theory is applied to these multiple evidence by considering their individual contribution and the most probable class of a pixel is identified. Integration of the three datasets by the proposed method is found to produce 88.4% and 84.6% for individual image. The proposed method improves the potential of using SPOT satellite imagery for change detection.",Classification,Neural,Satellite,Imagery,Land Use Land Cover,Changes,,"Larsen, Rene","Chinnasamy, Udhayakumar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ISPRS TECHNICAL COMMISSION VIII SYMPOSIUM,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in an urban park, Seoul Forest Park, which was built in 2004. We had two objectives: (1) to estimate SOC stocks (to a depth of 1 m) in different land-cover types (wetland, forest, lawn, and bare soil) and (2) quantify the change in the SOC concentration in topsoil in different land-use types over a 10 year period (2003-2013). We found a tenfold difference in SOC stocks across the different land-cover types within the park. Wetland soils had the highest stocks of SOC (13.99 +/- 1.05 kg m(-2)), followed by forest, lawn, and bare soils. We found that a ""cultural layer"" that preserved previous land use history located deep in the soil profile substantially increased SOC stocks in the wetland. SOC concentrations in the topsoil were approximately three times higher in 2013 than in 2003 (256 +/- 130%). The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from MODIS and Landsat satellite images revealed that land-use history, expansion of plant areas and growth of plants could explain the increase in SOC concentrations in topsoil over the 10 year period. These findings imply that urban park soils could act as a carbon sink, and understanding the land-use history and the choice of land-cover types in park planning can substantially influence the carbon budget of urban parks.

Especially in the Yellow River Basin, which has a variable climate and fragile ecology, such research is more important. This article takes the Huangfuchuan River Basin (HFCRB) in the middle reaches of the Yellow River as the research area, and analyzes the impact of climate change scenarios and land use/cover change scenarios on runoff by constructing a SWAT model. Using CMIP6 GCMs to obtain future climate data and the CA-Markov model to predict future land use data, the two are coupled to estimate the future runoff process in the HFCRB, and the uncertainty of the estimated runoff is decomposed and quantified. The results were as follows: (1) The SWAT model has good adaptability in the HFCRB. During the calibrated period and the validation period, R-2 >= 0.84, NSE >= 0.8, and |PBIAS| <= 17.5%, all of which meet the model evaluation criteria. (2) There is a negative correlation between temperature and runoff, and a positive correlation between precipitation and runoff. Runoff is more sensitive to temperature rise and precipitation increase. (3) The impact of land use types on runoff is in the order of cultivated land > grassland > forest land. (4) The variation range of runoff under the combined effects of future climate change and LUCC is between that of single climate change or LUCC scenarios. The increase in runoff under SSP126, SSP245, and SSP585 scenarios is 10.57%, 25.55%, and 31.28%, respectively. Precipitation is the main factor affecting the future runoff changes in the HFCRB.

The objective of this study is to assess land use/cover change in the Bharathapuzha river basin, Kerala during the period 1990-2017 using LANDSAT series satellite images. The dynamics of land use/cover change were quantified and mapped using geospatial techniques. The multi-temporal LANDSAT images were classified by supervised maximum likelihood method to generate the corresponding land use/cover maps; changes in land use/cover in the river basin were subsequently detected by the post-classification technique. Results of the study revealed a drastic change in land use/cover in the period 1990-2017; the primary causes of this were deforestation and urbanization. The near- and long-term future land use/cover maps of the basin for 2020 and 2035 were generated from the historically retrieved land use/cover change pattern.

In contrast, land use/land cover (LULC) dynamics drive considerable changes in ecosystem services. Recently, China witnessed a new stage of rapid urbanization. Therefore, investigating the relationships between ecosystem services value (ESV) and LULC in these areas is highly relevant. Based on the data of land use and socioeconomic development in Shanghai from 2000 to 2020, we adopted a land use/land cover dynamics analysis method and established the ESV per unit area at the city scale, discussed the impact of LULC on ESV spatially and quantitatively, and tested the research process based on the sensitivity analysis of the ESV coefficient. The results show that from 2000 to 2020, the LULC pattern in Shanghai rapidly changed. In particular, the area of cultivated land has shrunk by 123.96 thousand hm(2), while the construction land has expanded by 141.26 thousand hm(2), which has led to a decline in ESV of the entire city (especially regarding hydrological adjustment and biodiversity). Nevertheless, although the area of trench and lakes only occupies 1.67-3.16% of the total area of land, its ecological value accounts for an astonishing 23.80-50.70% of the total ESV.

However, due to the overall planning of the city and the advantages of its resource endowment, Qingpu District and its surrounding areas in western Shanghai have witnessed improvements in terms of the values of hydrological adjustment, water supply, and environmental purification.

Land use/cover change has been confirmed to have a significant impact on climate through various aspects that modulate LST and precipitation. However, there are no studies which illustrate this link in the Fez-Meknes region using satellite observations. Thus, the aim of this study was to monitor LST as a function of the land use change in the Saiss plain. In the study, 12 Landsat images of the year 2019 (one image per month) were used to represent the variation of LST during the year, and 2 images per year in 1988, 1999 and 2009 to study the interannual variation in LST. The mapping results showed that the land use/cover in the region has undergone a significant evolution; an increase in the arboriculture and urbanized areas to detriment of arable lands and rangelands. On the basis of statistical analyses, LST varies during the phases of plant growth in all seasons and that it is diversified due to the positional influence of land use type. The relationship between LST and NDVI shows a negative correlation (LST decreases when NDVI increases). This explains the increase in LST in rangelands and arable land, while it decreases in irrigated crops and arboriculture.",land surface temperature,land use/cover,NDVI,landsat image,saiss plain,Morocco,,"Oulidi, Hassane Jarar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the rapid rate of development, this Himalayan state has recently experienced many land use changes. To better understand the dynamics of land cover, the study's main objectives are to define the key LULC classes and compute and assess the size and rate of change for these classes during a 20-year period (2000 to 2020). For the purpose of this study, we processed and classified images using the Google Earth Engine Platform. The Landsat surface reflectance data products were selected for the years 2000, 2010 and 2020. Thereafter, the median of image collections was derived to get the final image to be classified for the study area. The Random Forest classifier was used to classify the images into seven landcover classes, i.e., agriculture, forest, water, glacier, built-up, grassland, and barren. The results revealed that the total area covered by agriculture has declined over time (0.26%), while forests (1.04%) and built-up areas (0.48%) in the state have expanded from the year 2000 to 2020. The main reason for the reduction in agriculture area is decrease in agricultural activities, while afforestation and continuous infrastructural development have resulted in an increase in forest cover and built-up areas, respectively.

The first indicator is applied to a study area of 2942 km(2) in the northeast of Costa Rica for which 1992 aerial photographs are available. Spatial patterns of land cover can only be related to land cover modifications when good insight into the colonization history exists. For the study area, clear land-use sequences have been found. Both standard and gee-referenced Markov chains have been calculated for a smaller pilot area of 151 km(2) for which aerial photographs taken on five different dates area available. Clear differences in probabilities are found for soil type and polygon size. For the shape and boundary index, no clear relations were found in the pilot area.

The Maximum likelihood supervised classification technique was used to extract information from satellite data, and post-classification change detection method was employed to detect and monitor land use/cover change. Derived land use/cover maps were further validated by using high resolution images such as SPOT, IRS, IKONOS and field data. The overall accuracy of land cover change maps, generated from Landsat and IRS-1D data, ranged from 85% to 90%. The analysis indicated that the urban expansion of Dhaka Metropolitan resulted in the considerable reduction of wetlands, cultivated land, vegetation and water bodies. The maps showed that between 1960 and 2005 built-up areas increased approximately 15,924 ha, while agricultural land decreased 7,614 ha, vegetation decreased 2,336 ha, wetland/lowland decreased 6,385 ha, and water bodies decreased about 864 ha. The amount of urban land increased from 11% (in 1960) to 344% in 2005. Similarly, the growth of landfill/bare soils category was about 256% in the same period. Much of the city's rapid growth in population has been accommodated in informal settlements with little attempt being made to limit the risk of environmental impairments.

In order to understand the impacts on the environment, it is imperative that the rate and type of urban expansion is determined. Remote sensing is an efficient and effective way to study spatial change in urban areas and Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) is a valuable technique to retrieve subpixel landcover information from remote sensing images. In this research, urban growth trends in Las Vegas are studied over the 1990 to 2010 period using images from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP). The SMA model of TM pixels is calibrated using high resolution NAIP classified image. The trends of land cover change are related to the land surface temperature trends derived from TM thermal infrared images. The results show that the rate of change of various land covers followed a linear trend in Las Vegas. The largest increase occurred in residential buildings followed by roads and commercial buildings. Some increase in vegetation cover in the form of tree cover and open spaces (grass) is also seen and there is a gradual decrease in barren land and bladed ground. Trend analysis of temperature shows a reduction over the new development areas with increased vegetation cover especially, in the form of golf courses and parks.

For our study region, the built-up area increased by 35.66% (5380 km(2)) during the study period. In the meantime, cropland, grassland, and wetland decreased continuously. The expansion of built-up area and decline of vegetated land led to an increase of 1047 million m(3) (5.1%) in total WY. The impacts of LULC changes on WY were mainly determined by the biophysical characteristics of LULC composition. Vegetated land has relatively lower WY coefficients due to higher rates of evapotranspiration and water infiltration.

In this study, we examined the responses to various types of LUCC in the APENWC during the implementation of the Grain-forGreen project between 1993 and 2010 using the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model. The performance of the WRF model was validated by multiple types of observations. Results show that the WRF can accurately simulate regional water and energy processes in the APENWC, and that the water-energy cycles in the region are strongly affected by vegetation dynamics. During the period of 1993 and 2010, the most obviously increased land cover types were the grassland and barren land, and the decreased land cover types were shrublands and croplands in the study region. A significantly negative correlation (R-2 = 0.78) between land surface temperature (LST) and albedo was found, associated with a 0.5 degrees C reduction in the annual mean surface temperature in the APENWC between 1993 and 2010. Negative correlations between changes in evapotranspiration (ET) and albedo during the period in all seasons were also detected, except summer, when the correlation was positive (R-2 = 0.49). This is attributed to transpiration from plants being the main contributor to ET in summer and, hence total ET. The changes resulted in an increase of ET by 19.79 mm in summer, and decreases of ET by 1.15 mm, 13.22 mm, and 0.96 mm, respectively, in spring, fall, and winter. The LUCC also resulted in reductions in precipitation (of 2.3, 7.31, and 7.8 mm in spring, summer, and fall, respectively) by altering local ET and vapor flux cycles in the APENWC, and the study region contributed additional moisture from the local ET into the north of the region. The findings show that the grassland expansion reduces mean land surface temperature, which will delay germination of seeds and initiation of vegetation growth in spring. Increases in seasonal ET and reductions in seasonal precipitation will lead to soil drying, exacerbating risks of summer drought in the APENWC. The findings provide important information in facilitating formulation of effective strategies for sustainable development and ecological restoration in the APENWC and similar regions.",Land use/cover change,Land surface temperature,Evapotranspiration,Precipitation,Land-atmosphere interaction,,,"Tian, Jie","He, Chansheng",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Land cover maps with 30-m resolution from 1979, 1989, 1999, and 2007, interpreted from Landsat images, were used to analyze LULC changes during the last decades. The observed daily hydro-meteorological data from 1970 to 2006 were divided into four periods: 1970-1979, 1980-1989, 1990-1999, and 2000-2006. The SWAT model was utilized for each period with four LULC scenarios, which were developed by using the four LULC maps. Annual and monthly surface runoff and actual evapotranspiration (AET) were selected as important hydrologic elements to indicate the hydrologic response to LULC changes. The results revealed that distinct land cover changes occurred in the basin; the most important change was the conversion among vegetation cover classes of cropland, forest land, and grassland. Surface runoff always decreased as the LULC scenarios changed from 1976 to 2007 during all periods, but AET did not change regularly following the present LULC changes. Multiple regression equations between quantitative changes of LULC and hydrologic elements were developed. The equations indicated that the changes in three vegetation cover classes of grassland, cropland, and forest areas significantly affected hydrological elements and the increases of vegetation cover class areas all led to decreases in surface runoff and increases in AET. Moreover, given the same quantitative area change, the effects of cropland on hydrologic elements were the strongest, the effects of forest land were the second strongest, and the effects of grassland were the third. The effects of LULC changes on the seasonal distribution of hydrologic elements were also investigated. The results demonstrated that LULC changes have less influence on surface runoff and AET in nonflood seasons, but more influence in flood seasons, especially in July, August, and September, when the crops grow best. The results of this study improved the understanding of hydrologic responses to LULC changes and provided needed knowledge for agricultural decisions and the management of land use and integrated water resources.

Fully supervised semantic segmentation models have recently achieved tremendous success on this topic, but the limited annotation data will give rise to severe performance degradation.

In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework based on pseudo supervision to address these issues. We first focus on the feature representation and impose perturbation to enforce consistency constraints. Unlike the naive distance measurement used in traditional consistency training, the predictions formalized with one-hot encoding from the auxiliary segmentation network are leveraged as the online pseudo supervisions. It possesses a lightweight structure and is easily generalized to multi-level architecture for exploring preferable behavior on lower-scale objects. In addition, we introduce a plain pseudo-labeling scheme to further improve the segmentation results. Its used offline pseudo supervisions are sampled from the first-stage predictions via adopting a class-wise soft version to confidence thresholds. We measure the proposed framework on two typical coastal datasets and compare it with other state-of-the-art methods.

A total of 372 households and 30 discussants within a 5-km buffer zone of the forest reserves were selected for interview. Pearson's Chi-square tests were used to test association between independent variables (gender, age, education, wealth status, and household size) and use of forest products. Furthermore, binary logistic regression models were developed to examine determinants of forest products use and land-use and land-cover change. The chi-square results revealed a strong association among the following; charcoal production with gender, age and wealth; use of construction poles with household size; firewood collection with wealth; wild fruits collection with gender and household size; caterpillar collection with education; honey harvesting with gender and wealth; wild vegetable collection and use with education; use of thatching grass with wealth and household size; livestock fodder use with wealth and level of education; collection and use of bush meat with age and residence status; collection of material for brooms with age and wealth respectively.

Many studies have focused on detecting the effects of land cover patterns, including composition and configuration, on land surface temperature (LST) using remote sensing images. This study focused on distinct land cover feature, buildings, in center of Beijing, China, exploring the relationship between the LST of central building objects and land cover patterns in their neighboring areas. Classifying buildings into three groups (low-rise, mid-rise, and high-rise) allowed the effects of neighboring land cover patterns on building LST to be analyzed independently. We found that the composition of land cover features has a stronger impact on low-rise building LST than mid-rise and high-rise building LST. Moreover, low-rise building LST is highly related to the composition of neighboring vegetation and pavement. This relationship is limited for mid-rise buildings and high-rise buildings. Finally, LST can be mitigated not only by balancing the amount of vegetation and buildings, but, for low-rise buildings, can also be mitigated by optimizing their spatial configuration. This study enhances our understanding of the degree to which LST of different height buildings are affected by neighboring land cover patterns. In addition, important insights can be provided to urban planners on how to mitigate the impact of urbanization on UHI through urban design and vegetation management. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Farmland area has been reported to increase despite agriculture's vulnerability to climate variations. This great interplay among land-use dynamics, climate extremes, and food systems is, however, understudied. The current research, therefore, explores this interaction at both national and regional scales for the period between 2001 and 2017. Following an approach that employs remote sensing datasets on Net Primary Productivity (NPP), land cover types, drought indices, and climate variables, i.e. precipitation, temperature, and evapotranspiration, impacts of climate extremes and land cover changes on food production have been analysed. Similarly, the performance of ten major crops in Uganda over the last 6 decades has been detected using the Regime Shift technique. Key findings, thereof, indicate that NPP in farmlands is sensitive to climate variability, and this sensitivity varies spatially among the regions. Forests and permanent wetlands have been massively changed into farmlands, hence, moving a step forward into offsetting food insecurity but a step backward in preserving ecosystem services, espcially mitigating climate change. Furthermore, the noticeable increase in the total production of the major crops in Uganda seems to be derived mainly by the increase in area harvested affirming the step towards food security. However, the influences, thereof, may aggravate climate change impacts especially through reversing carbon sinks into carbon sources. This reversal could impact the crop yields further. Contrastingly, results from some crops illustrate the potential to increase crop production without necessarily expanding the cropland area. Therefore, Uganda may, instead, consider exploiting the maximum yield potential of crops through, for instance, augmenting rainfed agriculture with irrigation and enforcing effective policies rather than expanding farmland area. These findings collectively contribute further to our understanding of the importance of policies that ensure food security but at the same time preserve a healthy environment. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

With a rapidly increasing agrarian transition, these farmers must now juggle the agro-ecological limits of their farmlands with new state agricultural policies, growing market integration, and increasing extreme weather events. Despite about 60 percent of Vietnam's landmass comprising slopes greater than 15 degrees, there is sparse information regarding how best to support sustainable livelihood approaches in such regions. Yet, an understanding of current crop choices, agricultural limits, and farmer decision-making processes in such locales is vital for relevant, slope-related policy suggestions to be formulated. In this paper, we take a mixed methods approach, combining land-use and land cover (LULC) change mapping with qualitative interviews and observations, to investigate the interactions among sloping lands, LULC change, and local livelihoods in a remote, mountainous commune in northern Vietnam's borderlands. We analyze LULC maps for B.n Ph. commune, Lao Cai province, which contains 13 ethnic minority Hmong villages and has a fairly typical upland topography with three-quarters of the land sloped over 15 degrees. Focusing on three main findings from our LULC analysis we then determine the drivers and livelihood consequences of an increase of 'shrubs' on sloped land, specific pockets of conversion to 'bare soils', and an increase in particular urban areas. We find that state afforestation policies, lowland demand for 'authentic upland alcohols', and officials keen to raise the status of a nearby town, all factor into the challenges and opportunities farmers now face.",Livelihoods,Land-use land cover change,Sloping lands,Ethnic minorities,Hmong,Vietnam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The LUCC model was used to predict the LUCC of Xiamen from 2020 to 2030. We analyzed the characteristics of LUCC and landscape pattern changes and, finally, evaluated the effect of rapid LUCC on LER. Of the six landscape types investigated, built-up land and farmland demonstrated the most significant changes. The area of built-up land increased by 1.5 times in 2010 and is predicted to increase by 2.7 times in 2030 than that in 1990. The area of farmland increased from 34.5% in 1990 to 24.5% in 2010 and is predicted to decrease to 15.1% in 2030. The number of patches (NP) of built-up land decreased with increasing area, which promoted the dominance of built-up land over other landscape types. Five landscape types, those other than built-up land, increased in NP, landscape fragmentation, segmentation, and disturbance but decreased in dominance. The LER of Xiamen in 2010 was slightly lower than that in 1990. However, with the acceleration of urbanization, the LER in 2020 and 2030 will increase by 7.6% and 12.5% than that in 2010. The LER will significantly increase in areas such as the Huandong sea area, the second urban core of Xiamen, and northern Xiang'an.

The rapid expansion of agricultural activities in the Urmia Lake basin has predominately led to tremendous pressure on the limited water resources, which has accelerated the drying process of this lake. The objective of this study is to analyze the spatio-temporal dynamics of land use/land cover (LULC) (2000-2020) and simulate agricultural expansion (2030 and 2040) in the Urmia Lake basin. Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based classification approach was used on Landsat satellite imagery from 2000, 2010, and 2020 to derive respective LULC layers. Cellular Automata (CA)-Markov and Land Change Modeler (LCM) were employed to simulate and assess future agricultural growth and land cover changes. Furthermore, the water requirement of agricultural activities was estimated with the NETWAT model. The results showed that the areas covered by irrigated agriculture and gardens are projected to experience a significant increase. These findings indicated that the actual LULC change during 2000-2020 was 68,802 ha of garden growth (174% change), while the simulated change was expected to be 127,613 ha by 2040. Moreover, the statistical result showed an increase of irrigated and rain-fed agricultural lands by 147,948 ha (55.98%) and 356,372 ha (145.69%), respectively, by 2040. Adopting the NETWAT model, this study suggests that the changes in LULC of the region will increase the water requirement of agriculture activities from 1500 billion cubic meters in 2000 to more than 4100 billion cubic meters in 2040.",Land use,land cover change,Markov-cellular automata,Land change modeler,Support vector machine,Urmia Lake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study quantified the net change, exchange, total change, and transfer rate of LULC in the Jinghe River Basin (JRB), China using LULC data from 2000 to 2020. Through trajectory analysis, knowledge maps, chord diagrams, and standard deviation ellipse method, we examined the spatiotemporal characteristics of LULC changes. We further established an index system encompassing natural factors (digital elevation model (DEM), slope, aspect, and curvature), socio-economic factors (gross domestic product (GDP) and population), and accessibility factors (distance from railways, distance from highways, distance from water, and distance from residents) to investigate the driving mechanisms of LULC changes using factor detector and interaction detector in the geographical detector (Geodetector). The key findings indicate that from 2000 to 2020, the JRB experienced significant LULC changes, particularly for farmland, forest, and grassland. During the study period, LULC change trajectories were categorized into stable, early-stage, late-stage, repeated, and continuous change types. Besides the stable change type, the late-stage change type predominated the LULC change trajectories, comprising 83.31% of the total change area. The period 2010-2020 witnessed more active LULC changes compared to the period 2000-2010. The LULC changes exhibited a discrete spatial expansion trend during 2000-2020, predominantly extending from southeast to northwest of the JRB. Influential driving factors on LULC changes included slope, GDP, and distance from highways. The interaction detection results imply either bilinear or nonlinear enhancement for any two driving factors impacting the LULC changes from 2000 to 2020.

The study accounted for 1992, 2007 and 2022 as well as it will predict the change for 2037 and 2052. Landsat TM for 1992, ETM + for 2007, and Landsat-8 OLI for 2022 were used. In QGIS 3.16, the maximum likelihood method was utilized for supervised image classification. Using CA-Markov and the Land Change Modeler land use and land cover change for 2037 and 2052 were predicted. Validity and accuracy of the model was evaluated using actual and predicted land use and land cover changes of 2022. Topography, proximity to a town, stream, roads, and population density were used as input for the model. The results showed that between 1992 and 2007, cultivated land increased by 17.07% on average at a rate of 1.05%, while settlement increased by 17.51% at a rate of 1.08% per year.

Studies documenting the impacts of development are extensive; however, less is known about the scale at which species respond to development and specific features of altered landscapes that make them vulnerable. This shortcoming may be due to the difficulty of collecting data across large spatial extents, but filling these information gaps are critical, particularly for species that have a disproportionate influence on ecosystems, such as ecosystem engineers. One such species, the southeastern pocket gopher (Geomys pinetis), has been declining throughout its range (south-eastern United States) and continued loss will likely have strong effects on the imperiled longleaf pine ecosystem in which it is closely associated. Using range-wide data from presence-absence surveys and publicly available presence-only data, we used recent advances in species distribution modeling to understand this ecosystem engineer's associations with extensive land use and cover changes. Our study showed that pocket gophers inhabit a variety of land-use types, including regions with low levels of anthropogenic development, but are largely absent from intensely urbanized areas and closed-canopy forests. Conservation planning to reduce the spread of extensive development and forest management strategies to reduce closed-canopy systems will be instrumental in reducing the decline of the species and ultimately protection of the longleaf pine ecosystem.

Land use and land cover plays not only a significant role in controlling the quantity of the exported dissolved organic matter (DOM) but also influences the quality of DOM via various biogeochemical and biodegradation processes. We examined the characteristics and spatial distribution of DOM in five major lakes, in an estuary, and in the coastal waters of the Mississippi, USA, and investigated the influence of the land use and land cover of their watersheds on the DOM composition. We employed absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy including excitation-emission matrix (EEM) combined with parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis modeling techniques to determine optical properties of DOM and its characteristics in this study. We developed a site-specific PARAFAC model to evaluate DOM characteristics resulting in five diverse DOM compositions that included two terrestrial humic-like (C1 and C3), two microbial humic-like (C2 and C5), and one protein-like (C4) DOM. Our results showed elevated fluorescence levels of microbial humic-like or protein-like DOM in the lakes and coastal waters, while the estuarine waters showed relatively high fluorescence levels of terrestrial humic-like DOM. The results also showed that percent forest and wetland coverage explained 68 and 82% variability, respectively, in terrestrial humic-like DOM exports, while 87% variability in microbially derived humiclike DOM was explained by percent agricultural lands. Strong correlations between microbial humic-like DOM and fluorescence-derived DOM indices such as biological index (BIX) and fluorescence index (FI) indicated autochthonous characteristics in the lakes, while the estuary showed largely allochthonous DOM of terrestrial origin. We also observed higher concentrations of total dissolved phosphorous (TDP) and ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N) in coastal waters potentially due to photodegradation of refractory DOM derived from the sediment-bound organic matter in the coastal wetlands. This study highlights the relationships between the DOM compositions in the water and the land use and land cover in the watershed.

Accurate and up-to-date LULCC information is a mandatory part of environmental change analysis and natural resource management. In Sri Lanka, there is a significant temporal gap in the existing LULCC information due to the civil war that took place from 1983 to 2009. In order to fill this gap, this study presents a whole-country LULCC map for Sri Lanka over a 25-year period using Landsat time-series imagery from 1993 to 2018. The LandTrendr change detection algorithm, utilising the normalised burn ratio (NBR) and normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), was used to develop spectral trajectories over this time period. A land cover change and disturbance map was created with random forest, using 2117 manually interpreted reference pixels, of which 75% were used for training and 25% for validation. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 94.14%.

We assessed the extent of LULCC in the southern portion of the Nyong River basin through analysis of three land use maps in 1987, 2000 and 2014. LULCC impact on hydrological variables of the Mbalmayo, Olama, Pont So'o, Messam, and Nsimi sub-watersheds of the southern portion of the Nyong River basin were evaluated by using the linear regression modeling and the Mann-Kendall test. This study reveals that dense forest cover decreased by 16%, young secondary forest increased by 18%, agricultural/cropland increased by 10%, and built-up area/bare soil increased by 3% from 1987 to 2014. The decrease in dense forest cover at 0.6% per year on average was driven by indiscriminate expansion of subsistence agricultural/cropland through shifting and fallow cultivation farming systems. Nonsignificant trends in total discharge, high flows, and low flows were observed in the large sub-watersheds of Mbalmayo and Olama from 1998 to 2013 with LULCC within the watershed. In contrast, significant decreasing trends in stream discharge (up to -5.1% and -5.9%), and significant increasing trends in high flows (up to 2.1% and 6.3%), respectively, were observed in the small sub-watersheds of Pont So'o and Messam from 1998 to 2013, particularly with increase in agricultural/cropland cover and decrease in dense forest cover. However, we found non-significant trends in mean annual discharge and low flows for all and whole watershed with LULCC. The results reveal spatially varying trends of stream discharge, low flows and high flows among the sub-watersheds with LULCC within the study watershed. The results suggest that the impacts of LULCC on watershed hydrology are easily detected in small sub-watersheds than in large sub-watersheds. Therefore, the magnitude of dense forest cover loss must be significantly greater than 16% to cause significant changes and common trends in the hydrology of the sub-watersheds of the southern portion of the Nyong River basin.

Deforestation and forest disturbances associated with logging and fires, combined with extreme droughts, warmer air, and surface temperatures, have led to high tree mortality and harmful net carbon emissions in this region. Regional attempts to characterize land cover dynamics in this region focused on one or two anthropogenic drivers (i.e., deforestation and forest degradation). Land cover studies have also used a limited temporal scale (i.e., 10-15 years), focusing mainly on global and country-scale forest change. In this study, we propose a novel approach to characterize and measure land cover dynamics in the Amazon biome. First, we defined 10 fundamental land cover classes: forest, flooded forest, shrubland, natural grassland, pastureland, cropland, outcrop, bare and impervious, wetland, and water. Second, we mapped the land cover based on the compositional abundance of Landsat sub-pixel information that makes up these land cover classes: green vegetation (GV), non-photosynthetic vegetation, soil, and shade. Third, we processed all Landsat scenes with <50% cloud cover. Then, we applied a step-wise random forest machine learning algorithm and empirical decision rules to classify intra-annual and annual land cover classes between 1985 and 2022. Finally, we estimated the yearly land cover changes in forested and non-forested ecosystems and characterized the major change drivers. In 2022, forest covered 78.6% (331.9 Mha) of the Amazon biome, with 1.4% of secondary regrowth in more than 5 years. Total herbaceous covered 15.6% of the area, with the majority of pastureland (13.5%) and the remaining natural grassland. Water was the third largest land cover class with 2.4%, followed by cropland (1.2%) and shrubland (0.4%), with 89% overall accuracy. Most of the forest changes were driven by pasture and cropland conversion, and there are signs that climate change is the primary driver of the loss of aquatic ecosystems.

The SWAT model was run under a variety of prescribed scenarios including three climate changes, two land use changes, and three combined changes for the future period (2068-2100). The uncertainty and attribution of the sediment yield variations to the climate and land use/land cover changes at the monthly and annual scale were analyzed. The responses of the sediment yield to changes in climate and land use/land cover were considered. The results showed that all scenarios of climate changes, land use/land cover alterations, and combined changes projected an increase in sediment yield in the basin. Under three representative concentration pathways (RCP), climate change significantly increased the annual sediment yield (by 41.03-54.88%), and deforestation may also increase the annual sediment yield (by 1.1-1.2%) in the future.

This means that during the 2068-2100 period, climate change will exert a much larger influence on the sediment yield than land use/land cover alteration in XRB if the future land use/land cover remains unchanged after 2015. Moreover, climate change impacts alone on the spatial distribution of sediment yield alterations are projected consistently with those of changes in the precipitation and water yield.

The frequent conflation of land use and land cover has been appropriate and fruitful in regions where extractive activities are common, but the decoupling of household characteristics from land-cover choices in exurban landscapes may require that the two be treated separately. This research employs the concept of a land-use portfolio, defined as a unique combination of land use types, and land cover derived from remote sensing to examine the relationship between land use and land cover at the parcel scale. Data on the type and spatial organization of land use were collected for individual parcels through sketch maps constructed by land owners and then described quantitatively using GIS and spatial metrics from landscape ecology. The results of this analysis suggest that in the naturally forested region of south-central Indiana, parcels are frequently managed as multiple types of land use thereby supporting the portfolio approach. Generally, land-management complexity is related to land-cover fragmentation, but the strength of this relationship varies across portfolio types. In addition, substantial amounts of forest land cover occur in non-forest land uses further supporting the need to treat the two separately to accurately link land use intentions and land cover outcomes.",Land-use and land-cover change,Land-use portfolio,GIS,Sketch maps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results show that Accra and Kumasi grew at an annual rate of 4.5% and 6% respectively. Residential land use constituted the major addition in both cities. Accra, the capital city of Ghana, added the most non-residential built-up land. Moreover, growth in both cities was compact, with new built-up land use occurring adjacent to existing urban land at the beginning of the study period in 2000.

The runoff coefficients have increased in regions with less than 750 mm of annual rainfall, under Sahelian and sub-desertic climates, leading to increased flood peaks, occurring earlier in the season. Studies have shown a rapid change in landuse/land-cover (LUCC) since the 1970s over Sahelian river basins in Burkina-Faso and Niger. It is likely that the aridification of the environment-triggered by climatic change, especially rainfall shortage-is, to an important extent, enhanced by increasing agricultural activities. The relationships between hydrology and LUCC are studied using hydrological modelling. Rainfall/runoff modelling is improved when taking into account the spatio-temporal evolution of the LUCC through a time varying water holding capacity (WHC). The WHC, considered as the soil water reservoir in hydrological models, decreases as the natural vegetation is replaced by cultures or bare soil, leading to increased surface runoff.

In this study, two different years viz. 1993 and 2018 have taken for the preparation of LULC and land surface temperature map. The kappa coefficient has been implied in this investigation to assess the accuracy of LULC maps. Temperature maps show that summer and winter surface temperature increases at the rate of 0.15 degrees C and 0.19 degrees C per year respectively. The result also reveals that temperature mainly increases due to the presence of urban, industrial and coal mine areas. The changing land use and land cover patterns show that the coal mine areas have been increased by 15% and urban areas also increased by 60%. Some correlations have been prepared to show the relationship between Land Surface Temperature (LST) and other spatial indices like NDBI, NDVI, and NDWI, where negative correlation prevails between LST and NDVI also with NDWI, but positive relation exists between LST and NDBI.

In this study, the land cover analysis and correlation method for a certain period of time was used to classify the land cover of Andijan region with Landsat satellite images of 1997-2009-2020. A classification method combined with clustering was used to determine the land cover change, and a study was conducted using Google Earth software through 30 classes. The analysis shows that compared to 1997 (566.6 km2), the area of buildings and structures in the study area has expanded to 750 km2 in 2009 and in 2020 it was 770,4 km2, an increase of almost 1.4 times. Another aspect is that there is a decrease in the class of forested areas, gardens and cultivated fields. In particular, in 1997, the area of this class was 3047 km2, and by 2009 it had decreased to 2,430 km2. Thanks to the measures aimed at improving the geo-ecological situation, by 2020 the amount of the << green cover >> was 2,644 km2. In Andijan region, empty lands (bare soils and barren lands) amounted to 678.8 km2 in 1997 and had increased to 1,115 km2 (1.6 times) by 2009. In 2020, the area of degraded lands had decreased by 858 km2. The results of remote sensing studies show that the expansion of construction and bare land has led to a reduction in green space. The amount of dust in the atmosphere rises when green space decreases. Another object representing the geo-ecological situation is water bodies, which has in-creased in the studied area.

The simulated results on the hydrological responses reveal that depletion of the vegetation cover in the study area and increase in impervious and bare surface cover due to anthropogenic interventions are the primary reasons for the increased runoff, erosion and sediment discharges in the Dal lake catchment.

The analysis revealed that in the last 30 years, water bodies, forest, and woodland decreased by 15.3, 66.3, and 69.2 per cent, respectively; intensive cultivation, mixed cultivation/woodland, and degraded land increased by 34.5, 79.7, and 200.7 per cent. The major causes of land use and cover change (LUCC) and land degradation in the area were population and livestock growth in regions of limited resources, unsustainable farming techniques, the Ethiopian land tenure system and poverty. Lake level and area decline, and accelerated land degradation are the major environmental impacts of LUCC observed in the CRV. The environmental and socio-economic consequences of LUCC and land degradation are far-reaching.

In cases of wetlands composed of mixed natural and man-made areas, similarities in substrate-vegetation-water compositions may pose challenges in the applicability of remote sensing and GIS techniques for the study of landscape changes, requiring tailor-made, case-specific methods. We explored this supposition by testing these techniques for the study of the Bahia de Cadiz Nature Park (Spain).

With the widespread influence of both human activities and natural processes, however, land cover and land use change (LCLUC) has dominated across various ecosystems in more than one-third of world's land surface. LCLUC could lead to changes in vegetation types and species composition at local to regional scales. Thus, we hypothesize that LCLUC can significantly influence phenological trends at an ecosystem scale. Here we tested this hypothesis in agricultural ecosystems composed of various crop types spanning the Midwest of the United States by analyzing satellite-observed land surface phenology from 1982 to 2014. Greenup onset dates in croplands occurred later at rates ranging from 0.18 to 0.67 d yr(-1) at the state scale. This trend was due to significant areal increases in corn (maize) and soybean that have later emergence coupled with areal decreases in wheat and oats that have earlier emergence, despite a trend of warmer spring temperatures that aid earlier crop emergence. Overall, considering the long-term directional change in greenup onset dates across these croplands, two-thirds was attributable to LCLUC and one-third to climatic variation. This finding indicates that extensive LCLUC can be the primary driver of satellite-observed phenological trends, especially in intensively managed agricultural landscapes.",land surface phenology,land cover and land use change,climate change,long-term trend,agriculatural ecosystems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assessed previous drought trends (1980-2020) and future drought in the context of climate change, in accordance with three selected scenarios from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 global climate models which have recently been released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2021-2060) using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The change of land use for the period 2010-2020 was then assessed and the associated climatic variability explored. The results show that for the period 1980-2019, SPI 3 responds quickly to changes in precipitation, whereas SPI 9 showed a clear trend of precipitation over time. The first longest duration occurrence of drought for SPI 3, SPI 6, and SPI 9 patterns were respectively 15-16, 21, and 25 months at Chau Doc station, and respectively 11, 14-15, and 16-17 months at Tri Ton station.

In addition, for all-time series scales and climate change scenarios, the levels of drought were slight, followed by moderate. In the future, the humidity at Chau Doc station is expected to decrease, while the occurrence of drought events is expected to increase at Tri Ton station, particularly in SPI 6 patterns (110 drought events in 1980-2020, and up to 198 drought events in the future). Moreover, between 2010-2020, the agricultural land area was seen to decrease, replaced by non-agricultural land uses that were found to increase by 22.4%.

As such, the basins extend beyond spatial units of physical resources and human relations analysis to policy research and reform units. The comprehensive view of water basins in research goes along with an observed increase in anthropogenic-driven changes, such as land use and land cover changes, and cases of ineffective remedial measures to the adverse change, such as through applying integrated watershed management approaches. The human-induced land cover changes affect the water basin's biodiversity, for instance, contributing to an increase in zoonotic disease outbreaks like coronaviruses. The Lake Victoria basin exhibits similar patterns of change and effects due to, among other factors, land tenure, whose contribution is less known empirically. Therefore, this paper integrates satellite imagery and catchment survey data to examine the relationship between land tenure and land uses and land cover changes in the Lake Victoria basin of Eastern Africa. Additionally, explore the contextual character and role of three land tenure systems of Customary, Native freehold and Mailo found in the Uganda country segment of the basin in explaining the outcomes. The aim is to provide information that, among other benefits, improves water basin management and governance. The results indicate a statistically significant relationship exists between the perceived extent of land use and land cover change; drivers of change; the extent of adopting sustainable land-use practices, and the prevailing land tenure. Though with different tenure systems, the three case study water catchments experienced adverse land use and cover changes. The changes mainly affected land tenure indicative land use and cover classes, prominently on the Customary, Mailo, and Native freehold land tenure systems. However, marginal differences occur among the land tenure systems, as the systems feature both de jure and de facto systems and an orientation towards customary tenure characters. The situation likely explains the observed closeness in perceptions regarding the role and relationship between land tenure and land use and cover changes, tenure systems character, perceived drivers of change and eventual outcomes, including the sustainable land use practices adoption. In addition to explaining the land use and cover change, land tenure is an essential tool for restoration and sustainable basin development and sustainability.

An integrating classification method based on decision tree classifier and object-oriented method is used for improving land cover classification accuracy. By analyzing the relationship between brightness temperature and vegetation indices, e.g., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), the relationship between UHI and LUCC is estimated quantitatively. Change results and regression analysis show that total transformation rate of LUCC behaves linearly decreased with increasing distance to roads while the transformation rate from other types to building/road has a negative exponent relation with the distance to roads. Analysis to urban green space and thermal landscape indicates that brightness temperature is negatively correlated with the. NDVI but positively related with NDBI.

Therefore, it is necessary to quantify the LCLU changes and the impacts on the climate in the East Asian monsoon (EAM) region, where significant human-induced LCLU changes have occurred. This study quantified the LCLU transitions with fractional maps produced using the recently developed categorical LCLU maps from 1982 to 2015. In the five sub-regions, identified as having undergone significant LCLU transitions, the relationships of the transitions with 2 m temperature were investigated using the ERA5-Land reanalysis data. The quantified LCLU transitions revealed that, in northeastern China, the dominant trend was forests and grasslands changing into croplands. Moreover, in the marginal areas of Inner Mongolia, the transitions of grasslands to croplands and forests were evident. Croplands were mainly converted to forests in the Sichuan region. In particular, in the Sichuan region, the temperature increased by more than 0.04 degrees C as the forests increased by 1%. In the marginal areas of Inner Mongolia, a 1% decrease in grasslands and a 1% increase in forests, respectively, were associated with a temperature rise of more than 0.03 and 0.04 degrees C. The detected LCLU transitions affect the regional warming as demonstrated by correlation, regression and Granger-causality analyses and the related biogeophysical processes. Thus, the identified LCLU transitions can change the regional climate and potentially affect the monsoon systems by changing the contrast in heat between land and ocean.

The aim of this study is to project the future land use and land cover changes from 2010 to 2030 in Punjab province under three scenarios: Business-as-Usual scenario (BAU), Rapid Economic Growth scenario (REG) and Coordinated Environmental Sustainability scenario (CES). This article used the previously developed Dynamics of Land System (DLS) model to simulate the land use changes in response to the driving mechanisms. The results indicate that cultivated land and built-up areas would expand while areas of water and grassland would face contraction under all three scenarios. Nevertheless, future land demand varies in different scenarios. Under the CES scenario; forest area would expand in the future while large reduction in unused land would be observed. Under the REG scenario, augmented expansion of built-up areas and drastic decrease in forest areas would be the main features of land use changes. Our findings in the scenario analysis of land use changes can provide a reference case for sustainable land use planning and management in Punjab province.",land use change,scenarios,dynamics of land system (DLS) model,Punjab province,,,,"Chen, Dongdong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a product of traditional small-holder shifting cultivation. To date, thanks to its distinction from primary forest, this area has been mapped as relatively homogenous, leaving the proportions of land cover heterogeneity within it unknown. However, the success of strategies for sustainable development, including land use planning and payment for ecosystem services, such as Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation, depends on the accurate characterization of the impacts of land use on natural resources, including within the rural complex. We photo-interpreted a simple random sample of 1000 points in the established rural complex, using 3106 high resolution satellite images obtained from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, together with 406 images from Google Earth, spanning the period 2008-2016. Results indicate that nationally the established rural complex includes 5% clearings, 10% active fields, 26% fallows, 34% secondary forest, 2% wetland forest, 11% primary forest, 6% grasslands, 3% roads and settlements and 2% commercial plantations. Only a small proportion of sample points were plantations, while other commercial dynamics, such as logging and mining, were not detected in the sample. The area of current shifting cultivation accounts for 76% of the established rural complex. Added to primary forest (11%), this means that 87% of the rural complex is available for shifting cultivation. At the current clearing rate, it would take similar to 18 years for a complete rotation of the rural complex to occur. Additional pressure on land results in either the cultivation of non-preferred land types within the rural complex (such as wetland forest), or expansion of agriculture into nearby primary forests, with attendant impacts on emissions, habitat loss and other ecosystems services.",Democratic Republic of Congo,shifting cultivation,REDD,LCLUC,land cover and land use,remote sensing,slash and burn,"Tyukavina, A.","Stehman, S.","Barker, B.","Humber, M.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon, highly related to the rapid urbanization, has attracted considerable attention from both academic scholars and governmental policymakers because of its direct influence on citizens' daily life. Land surface temperature (LST) is a widely used indicator to assess the intensity of UHI significantly affected by the local land use/cover (LULC). In this study, we used the Landsat time-series data to derive the LULC composition and LST distribution maps of Nanjing in 2000, 2014, and 2018. A correlation analysis was carried out to check the relationship between LST and the density of each class of LULC. We found out that cropland and forest in Nanjing are helping to cool the city with different degrees of cooling effects depending on the location and LULC composition. Then, a Cellar Automata (CA)-Markov model was applied to predict the LULC conditions of Nanjing in 2030 and 2050. Based on the simulated LULC maps and the relationship between LST and LULC, we delineated high- and moderate-LST related risk areas in the city of Nanjing.

However, the risk of ecosystem services degradation in Afghanistan over the past two decades has significantly increased, mainly due to rapid changes in land-use and land-cover (LULC). As such, policy makers must be able to estimate the impact of LULC changes on various ecosystem services. By utilizing GlobeLand30 land cover products for 2000, 2010 and 2020, and by adopting the value transfer method, this study assessed the ecosystem services value (ESV) changes in response to the changes of LULC in Afghanistan. Additionally, the dynamics of the land system (DLS) model was innovatively coupled with linear programming to predict likely scenarios of ESV changes by 2030. The predicted results were also validated against actual land cover and achieved a Kappa value of 0.78. The results showed that over the 20-year period, ecologically important LULC categories such as forest, water bodies and grassland were severely unstable and rapidly decreasing in scope. These LULC types were being threatened by agricultural, built-up and unused lands. During this period, we estimated a decrease in the total ESV from 161 billion USD in 2000 to 152.27 billion USD in 2020. About 92% of this decrease was shared by supporting and provisioning services. The simulated scenarios also showed that ESV will likely further decrease under Business-As-Usual (BAU), and Rapid Economic Development (RED) scenarios. Positively, an Environmental Protection (ENP) scenario is predicted, with a 4.5% increase in ESV by 2030.

This paper describes the generation of a regionally optimized land cover dataset for West Africa with a spatial resolution of 250 m, which is based on earth observation data from three optical and radar instruments. The choice of sensors is based on their individual strengths and weaknesses in assessing specific land surface types. Annual profiles of the optical Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are analyzed for the classification of vegetated classes including agriculture. The classification approach builds on random forest classification with learning data extracted from higher resolution land cover maps. Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) Wide Swath (WS) time series are used, in combination with MODIS data, to delineate permanent and seasonal water bodies. Here, an approach integrating threshold classification and morphological operations is applied. Built-up areas of different densities are identified based on a seamless coverage of radar imagery collected by the satellites TanDEM-X and TerraSAR-X. The detection of settlements is based on an unsupervised classification scheme which exploits texture metrics and backscattering amplitudes of the fine resolution radar sensors. The accuracy assessment of the multi-sensor land cover map yields an overall accuracy of 80% at legend level 1 (9 classes) and 73% at the more detailed legend level 2 (14 classes).

In this study, an attempt has been made to identify the main drivers behind the LULC changes that had occurred in the past four decades in Munessa-Shashemene landscape of the south-central highlands of Ethiopia. The datasets required for the study were generated through both primary and secondary sources. Combination of techniques, including descriptive statistics, GIS-based processing, and regression analyses were employed for data analyses. Changes triggered by the interplay of more than 12 drivers were identified related to social, economic, environmental, policy/institutional, and technological factors. Specifically, population growth, expansion of cultivated lands and settlements, livestock ranching, cutting of woody species for fuelwood, and charcoal making were the top six important drivers of LULC change as viewed by the local people and confirmed by quantitative analyses. Differences in respondents' perceptions related to environmental (i.e., location specific) and socioeconomic determinants (e.g., age and literacy) about drivers were statically significant (P = 0.001). LULC changes were also determined by distances to major drivers (e. g., the further a pixel is from the road, the less likelihood of changes) as shown by the landscape level analyses.

Nival area would shrink, and desertification area would expand at a comparatively slow rate in future 100 years. Climate change would generally cause less ecotope diversity and more patch connectivity.

During the last 20 years considerable research efforts have been devoted to the extraction of land cover information from these data. Only during the last few years have these methods begun to be applied in operational contexts. Such applications have thus far primarily addressed key global change issues such as the global carbon balance. Examples of the successful quasi-operational implementation of remote sensing include NASA's Humid Tropical Landsat Pathfinder project, where high resolution data are being used at subcontinental scales to measure change in the areal extent of tropical rain forests throughout the world, and the Tropical Ecosystem Environment observation by Satellite (TREES) project to assess forest cover in the tropics. At coarser resolutions, a number of land cover products suitable for incorporation in global and regional models have been developed. Alternatives to traditional land cover classifications have also been developed to describe gradients and mosaics in the vegetation more realistically. These land cover products offer the possibility for applications in ecological and human dimensions research at regional and global scales, as well as for implementation of international agreements that require land cover information. Recently launched and future satellites will carry sensors that provide data with greatly improved capabilities for land cover characterization and advancements in computing environments make it feasible to take advantage of these new data. However, several challenges must be overcome in making a transition from research to operational land cover monitoring, including automation of methods to analyse the satellite data, more effective techniques for validation, and assurance of long-term continuity in the availability of satellite measurements.",land cover,remote sensing,satellite data,operational monitoring,global vegetation,tropical deforestation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These areas are facing multiple stresses including degradation of land resources; vagaries of climate and depletion of water resources continuously affect land use practices and livelihoods. To understand the Land use/Land cover (Lu/Lc) changes in a semi-arid mountain landscape, Kallar watershed of Bhavani basin, in southern India has been chosen. Most of the hilly part in the study area covers with forest, plantation, orchards and vegetables and which are highly affected by severe soil erosion, landslide, frequent rainfall failures and associated drought. The foothill regions are mainly utilized for agriculture practices; due to water scarcity and meagre income, the productive agriculture lands are converted into settlement plots and wasteland. Hence, land use/land cover change deduction; a stochastic processed based method is indispensable for future prediction. For identification of land use/land cover, and vegetation changes, Landsat TM, ETM (1995, 2005) and IRS P6-LISS IV (2015) images were used. Through CA-Markov chain analysis, Lu/Lc changes in past three decades (1995, 2005, and 2015) were identified and projected for (2020 and 2025); Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were used to find the vegetation changes. The result shows that, maximum changes occur in the plantation and slight changes found in forest cover in the hilly terrain. In foothill areas, agriculture lands were decreased while wastelands and settlement plots were increased.

Monitoring and identifying the geographic and temporal land-cover changes and driving forces in this unique type of area may help to give the scientific basis needed to understand the effects of climate change and human activities on LUCC. The Third Pole is one such landscape that provides inevitable key ecosystem services to over 2 billion people in Asia. However, this important landscape is increasingly being threatened by the impacts of climate change. Policy and program responses to the Third Pole's mounting socioeconomic challenges are inadequate and lack scientific evidence. Using the land-change model (LCM) and historical data from 1992 onwards, our study attempted to (i) detect the spatial patterns of land use and land-cover changes in the Third Pole from 1992 to 2020; and (ii) project them into 2060. Our analysis shows that the land use and land-cover types in the Third pole are undergoing changes. About 0.07% of the snow and ice have melted in the last three decades, indicating global warming. This melt has resulted in increasing water bodies (0.08%), especially as glacial lakes. This has significantly increased the risk of glacial outburst floods. Other key alpine land-cover types that decreased are bare land (0.6%) and agricultural land (0.05%). These land types represent important habitats for wild flora and fauna, grazing land for livestock, and food for nomads, and their loss will directly degrade ecological services and the health and wellbeing of the nomads. Land cover of forest, shrubs, and scanty vegetation have all increased by 0.3%, 0.02%, and 0.77%, respectively, inducing socio-ecological changes in the Third pole mountains. Further predication analysis showed that snow and ice, along with bare land, will continue to recede whereas forest, grassland, water bodies, shrubland, sparse vegetation, and settlement will increase. These results indicate the increasing impact of global warming that will continue to change the Third Pole. These changes have serious implications for designing adaptation and mitigation interventions in the mountains. We recommend more detailed research to investigate the underlying factors that are changing the Third Pole to develop policy and programs to help humans, livestock, and biodiversity adapt to the changes in these remote and harsh mountains.

Understanding the correlation among land use/cover and water quality parameters is vital for future water quality management. In this work, land use/cover pattern and its effect on water quality in the Mindu Dam drainage area were analysed using Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques together with Cellular Automata-Markov model. The land use/cover images between 1990 and 2020 were used to assess historical and spatial change of land use/cover change, and projected for 2030 and 2040. We discovered that the dynamics of land use and cover during the study period were significant. A strong correlation was revealed between changes in the land use/cover and water quality parameters. Furthermore, a strong correlation exists between cultivated land and measured nutrient (nitrate and phosphate) and chlorophyll-a concentration. The natural vegetation buffer around Mindu Dam should be sufficient to prevent long-term water quality degradation from agricultural runoff in order to manage water quality sustainably.

Satellite-derived nighttime light images, mainly provided by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) day/night band (DNB), have been increasingly used to study demographic and socioeconomic activities for a wide range of issues-for instance, human population dynamics, economic growth, and urbanization process-at multiple scales. In practice, the lack of texture information regarding man-made surfaces would usually lead to substantial difficulty in delineating the spatial dynamics in human settlements due to the diverse distributions of artificial nocturnal lighting sources, which are closely related to the predominant land-use/land-cover (LULC) types and their evolutions. An understanding of how nighttime lighting signals respond to synchronous anthropogenic LULC changes, therefore, is crucially important for the spatiotemporal investigations of human settlement dynamics. In this study, we used DMSP-derived nighttime light (NTL) data and Landsat-derived LULC maps to quantitatively estimate the pixel-level responses of NTL signals to different types of human-induced LULC conversions between 1995 and 2010 across China. Our results suggest that the majority (>70%) of pixel-level LULC conversions into artificial lands (including urban, rural, and built-up lands) might show a statistically significant increase in nighttime brightness with an average >20 (in digital number, DN) step change in nighttime lights (dNTL), both of which are distinctly higher than that in the LULC conversions into non-man-made surfaces on the whole. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve-based analysis implies that we might have an average chance of -90% to identify the nationwide LULC conversions into man-made surfaces from all types of conversions through the observed changes in artificial nocturnal luminosity signals. Moreover, ROC curve-based analyses also yield two nation-level optimal dNTL thresholds of 4.8 and 7.8 DN for recognizing newly emerged three types of artificial lands and urban lands between 1995 and 2010 across the entire country, respectively. In short, our findings reveal fundamental insights into the quantitative connections between the anthropogenic LULC changes and the corresponding responses of synchronous nightlight signals at the pixel-level, which are generally essential for further applications of satellite-derived nocturnal luminosity data in the spatiotemporal investigations of human settlement dynamics.",nighttime light,land-use/land-cover change,step change,artificial lands,optimal threshold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Ethiopia, a conversion of forest and grass lands into cultivated and urbanized lands has been reported. While such changes are known to have multidirectional impacts on river flows, erosion and sedimentation, and the socio-economic situation within a catchment, there is a lack of assessment on the scale and rate of these changes, and consequent impacts. This study quantifies the rate of LULC in the Gumara catchment (1413 km(2)), an important tributary to Lake Tana in northwest Ethiopia. Landsat images of three years (1986, 2001 and 2015) were processed using the supervised classification method. An extensive field survey generated over 150 ground truth points, which were used in the classification and accuracy assessment process. Then, a conceptual rainfall-runoff model (HBV) was calibrated and validated to assess the impacts of LULC changes on water balance components - evapotranspiration, soil moisture, groundwater recharge and runoff. Additionally, the decadal means and trends of precipitation and discharge were analysed to further examine and quantify the observed changes (if any).A reasonably reliable LULC classification was achieved, with an overall accuracy of 90%. The results indicated that the catchment area under forest and grass land was about 11 and 18%, respectively, in 1986, which reduced to 5 and 10%, respectively, in 2015. In contrast, cultivated land increased from 70% in 1986 to 82% in 2015. Contrary to the expected impact of these LULC changes on hydrology, the HBV model, indicated only a slight change in the water balance components (+/- 5%). Runoff and all other water balance components remained more or less stable despite considerable LULC changes. However, the uncertainties encountered in the modelling process (e.g. model structure, LULC representation) could have masked the LULC impacts on hydrology. This was supported by the significant increase in the observed discharge indicated by the statistical analysis, even in view of no substantial changes in precipitation. Therefore, LULC could cause considerable increase in discharge, which needs further testing (e.g. through physically based modelling with detailed inclusion of LULC processes).",Land use and land cover changes,Hydrology,Gumara catchment,The HBV model,Trend analysis,Uncertainty,,"Nyssen, J.","Cai, X.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate that SPDs offer a useful approach to outline differences between regions and a useful complement to archaeological site surveys, evaluated here especially for the onset of the Neolithic and for the Final Neolithic (FN)/Early Bronze Age (EBA) transition. Pollen analysis highlight differences in vegetation between the two sub-regions, but also several parallel changes. The comparison of land cover dynamics between two sub-regions of Greece further demonstrates the significance of the bioclimatic conditions of core locations and that apparent oppositions between regions may in fact be two sides of the same coin in terms of socio-ecological trajectories. We also assess the balance between anthropogenic and climate-related impacts on vegetation and suggest that climatic variability was as an important factor for vegetation regrowth.

A high classification performance was obtained for both images (kappa > 0.88, overall accuracy > 90%). After the classification process, LULC maps for both years were generated, and statistical calculations for the LULC change were computed for both the entire study area (15 x 25 km) and a buffer zone with a radius of 1 km around the power plant. In the whole study area, artificial surfaces significantly increased (78.46%), whereas forests (- 8.31%) and barren lands experienced a considerable decrease (- 6.11%). In the 1 km buffer, artificial surfaces predominantly increased (113.94%), while forests and barren lands decreased dramatically (- 69.13% and - 74.28%, respectively). The agricultural areas in the study area were changed into other LULC classes: 9.1% to artificial surfaces, 27.6% to barren lands, and 21.7% to forest.

The Chemoga Basin-the highlands region in northwestern Ethiopia-has experienced accelerated soil erosion due to changes in land-use and land-cover (LULC) in recent decades. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model was used to quantify the impact of LULC changes on soil loss in the study area. Satellite images from 1987 and 2017 were used to characterize the spatial patterns of LULC changes. All RUSLE factors were mapped on a 30 m x 30 m grid to reflect the natural and environmental conditions of the study area. An expansion of agricultural lands occurred between 1987 and 2017, while the area of natural vegetation cover such as woodlands and grasslands declined. Forest cover has recovered in recent years as a result of afforestation and eucalyptus plantations. Reflecting LULC changes, the total soil loss in the study area was estimated at 2,087,894 t year(-1) in 1987, which increased to 2,112,093 t year(-1) in 2017. Agricultural lands accounted for 89.3% and 90.1% of the total soil loss in 1987 and 2017, respectively. The results showed that slope gradient and elevation are important factors in agricultural land conversion, and thereby influence soil erosion.

Understanding recent historical land cover changes and their interlinkages with key environmental processes is instrumental to better support strategies for land-use management. The recently released products from the European Space Agency and Copernicus Climate Change Service contain high-resolution (300 m) time series of global land cover maps from 1992 to 2018. This study investigates the land transitions in these products and explores the effects on two key environmental aspects, namely, carbon losses from deforestation and soil erosion rates. We used a powerful server for big data analysis to retain the original spatial resolution of the datasets. We found 722 Mha (5.5 % of the total ice-free land surface) of gross land cover changes, which mainly involved transitions to and from forest/agriculture. Cropland gains are 205 Mha and losses 126 Mha (net expansion of 79 Mha). Deforestation occurring in 242 Mha was mainly caused by agricultural expansion, whereas 196 Mha were afforested. Settlements show the largest relative expansion (44 Mha, +210 %), of which 67 % (29 Mha) occurred at expenses of agricultural land. Deforestation caused 12.3 (7.6/14.2) Gt Carbon losses from below- and aboveground biomass from 2010 to 2018, corresponding to 1.5 (1.0/1.8) Gt Carbon per year.

Our goal was to understand the effects of institutional changes on agricultural land abandonment in different countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union after the collapse of socialism. We studied similar to 273 800 km(2) (eight Landsat footprints) within one agro-ecological zone stretching across Poland, Belarus, Latvia, Lithuania and European Russia. Multi-seasonal Landsat TM/ETM+ satellite images centered on 1990 (the end of socialism) and 2000 (one decade after the end of socialism) were used to classify agricultural land abandonment using support vector machines. The results revealed marked differences in the abandonment rates between countries. The highest rates of land abandonment were observed in Latvia (42% of all agricultural land in 1990 was abandoned by 2000), followed by Russia (31%), Lithuania (28%), Poland (14%) and Belarus (13%). Cross-border comparisons revealed striking differences; for example, in the Belarus-Russia cross-border area there was a great difference between the rates of abandonment of the two countries (10% versus 47% of abandonment). Our results highlight the importance of institutions and policies for land-use trajectories and demonstrate that radically different combinations of institutional change of strong institutions during the transition can reduce the rate of agricultural land abandonment (e.g., in Belarus and in Poland). Inversely, our results demonstrate higher abandonment rates for countries where the institutions that regulate land use changed and where the institutions took more time to establish (e.g., Latvia, Lithuania and Russia). Better knowledge regarding the effects of such broad-scale change is essential for understanding land-use change and for designing effective land-use policies. This information is particularly relevant for Northern Eurasia, where rapid land-use change offers vast opportunities for carbon balance and biodiversity, and for increasing agricultural production on previously cultivated lands.",agricultural land abandonment,institutional change,land-use and land-cover change,transition,post-socialist,USSR,remote sensing,"Kuemmerle, Tobias","Mueller, Daniel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,support vector machines,,,,,,,,,,,

It is formulated with a consistency self-training procedure where a dynamic class-balanced threshold selection scheme is proposed to provide high-confident pseudo supervisions for each category. In addition, we introduce pixel-wise contrastive learning on the common embedding space from both labeled and unlabeled data domains to further facilitate the semantic dependencies among category features, in which the reliable labels are leveraged as guidance for pixel sample selection.

Given the inconvenience of transition level in the detailed and overall presentation of various category transitions at multiple intervals, a novel transition pattern is proposed to represent the transition's size and intensity and to intuitively identify the stationary mode of transition, which helps the transition level to connect to the mode with the process. Intensity Analysis was conducted to communicate the transition between LULC categories in Hengyang from 1980 to 2015. The patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model was employed for multi-scenario projection from 2015 to 2045. From 1980 to 2015, 2005 was a significant turning point in the speed of LULC change in Hengyang, and the change rate after this time point was three times that before the time point. The gain of built-up and bare, and the loss of cultivated was always active. The reason for the large loss of forest is that forest comprises the largest proportion of Hengyang. The loss of cultivated and the loss of forest contributing to the built-up's gain is much larger, but the mechanism behind the transition differed. A stationary targeting transition mode from cultivated to built-up in Hengyang was detected. The PLUS model confirmed that the area of forest, cultivated and grass will reduce, and the rate of decrease will slow down in the future, while water areas will slightly increase.

As most cities in developing countries, including Ethiopia, are experiencing continuous expansion of built-ups and dynamic land use changes, monitoring and an in-depth analysis of the past, present and future predictions of these changes are important for a holistic understanding of the problem, its consequence, and to regulate proper land use intervention options. Thus, the main objective of this research is to assess land use dynamics and processes of land intervention in the peri-urban areas of Bahir Dar city using a socio-spatial analysis. It assesses to what extent the existing peri-urban land intervention processes and land use decisions are effective in combating and controlling unwanted land use changes. Primary socio-economic data were collected using questionnaires, focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews; in addition, spatial data including Landsat and Sentinel imageries of 1993, 2001, 2011 and 2020 were utilized. Land use/land cover (LULC) classes were computed using the integration of spectral and object-based image classification techniques. The results signal that built-ups are expanding horizontally with unpredicted patterns. This is because the existing land intervention processes are lacking effectiveness to govern the spatial patterns of built-ups. The results further depict that processes of land use intervention do not only determine horizontal urban expansion but also determine the nature of people-to-land relationships, which involve both formal and informal processes. This creates haphazard, disputed and unregulated land use systems in peri-urban areas of Bahir Dar. The socio-spatial methodology applied in this research is effective in monitoring both the spatial and social dimensions of land use changes. The spatial results effectively demonstrate the dynamics of land uses; whereas, the social analysis supports understanding of the processes of land use interventions.

During the last decades, there has been a notable tendency for abandonment of marginal agricultural land that is further associated with a number of ecological consequences. In this study we recorded and mapped the temporal changes of land use/land cover (LULC) classes that were further aggregated into major process-based changes for the period 1945-2009 in Aetoloakarnania prefecture, Greece. LULC mapping was based on aerial photographs acquired in 1945, 1960, 1985-1986 and 2007-2009. Object-based image analysis allowed the classification of the region's LULC classes and, consecutively, the assessment of process-based LULC changes for each time period. The results indicated that agricultural land increased during the first post-war years while abandonment of agricultural land took place during more recent decades, especially after the period 1960-1985. The observed land abandonment is combined with a simultaneous densification of shrublands and forests. Radical socio-economic changes that took place in the 1960's include the migration of rural populations towards big cities and the beginning of the development of the tourist industry. We argue that these socio-economic changes play an important role in shaping the observed LULC changes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

As part of this model, the distribution of land unhospitable to vegetation (hot and cold deserts) is determined dynamically from plant productivity under the prevailing climate conditions. The model for anthropogenic land cover change implements the land use transition approach by Hurtt et al. (2006). Our implementation is based on the assumption that historically pastures have been preferentially established on former grasslands (pasture rule). We demonstrate that due to the pasture rule, deforestation reduces global forest area between 1850 and 2005 by 15% less than without. Because of the pasture rule the land cover distribution depends on the full history of land use transitions. This has implications for the dynamics of natural land cover change because assumptions must be made on how agriculturalists react to a changing natural vegetation in their environment. A separate model representing this process has been developed so that natural and anthropogenic land cover change can be simulated consistently. Certain aspects of our model implementation are illustrated by selected results from the recent CMIP5 simulations.",land cover dynamics,Earth system modeling,land use change,dynamic vegetation model,,,,"Gayler, V.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study addresses methodological principles for land use development scenario modeling assumed for use in processes of GHG accounting and management. Associated land use policy implications in Lithuania are also discussed. Data on land uses, available from the National Forest Inventory (NFI) and collected for GHG accounting from the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector in the country, as well as freely available geographic information, were tested as an input for modeling land use development in the country. The modeling was implemented using the TerrSet Land Change Modeler. Calibration of the modeling approach using historical land use data indicated that land use types important for GHG management in the LULUCF sector were predicted with an accuracy above 80% during a five-year period into the future, while the prediction accuracy for forest and built-up land was 96% or more. Based on several land management scenarios tested, it was predicted that the LULUCF sector in Lithuania will accumulate CO2, with the forest land use type contributing most to CO2 absorption. Key measures to improve the GHG balance and carbon stock changes were suggested to be the afforestation of abandoned or unused agricultural land and prevention of the conversion of grassland into producing land.",land use,land use change,scenario,carbon stock changes,simulation,forest,producing land,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,grassland,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this research is to examine the performance of various classification algorithms for LCLU mapping in dry and humid climates (from June to August). Testing is performed in three case studies from each of the two climates in Iran. The reference dataset of each image was randomly selected from the entire images and was randomly divided into training and validation set. Training sets included 400 pixels, and validation sets included 200 pixels of each LCLU. Results indicate that the support vector machine (SVM) and neural network methods can achieve higher overall accuracy (86.7 and 86.6 %) than other examined algorithms, with a slight advantage for the SVM. Dry areas exhibit higher classification difficulty as man-made features often have overlapping spectral responses to soil.

The study area involves Idku Lake and the surrounding lands and occupies around 921 km(2). This area is exposed to both adverse ecological and anthropogenic activities. The main objectives of this study are; 1) detecting the historical change of the land surface elevation of the study area between 1942 and 2020, 2) identifying LULC classes in the study area between 1942 and 2020, and 3) predicting LULC change in 2030 under two different scenarios. The contour lines were extracted from the digitized topographic maps of 1942 to generate DEM then compared with 2020 SRTM-DEM to check the elevation change. The results show that around 97% and 88% of the area had an elevation < 3 m in 1942 and 2020, respectively. The maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) was applied on Landsat images to distinguish the LULC classes in 1972, 1984, 1998, 2013, and 2020, besides the digitized topographic map of 1942. Five LULC classes are distinguished in the study area water bodies, natural vegetation, fish farms, agricultural land, and bare soil. The results reveal that between 1942 and 2020, water bodies and bare soils are significantly decreased from 17% to 2% and 31%-15%, respectively, whereas the agricultural lands increased from 48% to 70% of the study area. Additionally, the land change modeler (LCM) was applied to predict the spatio-temporal distributions of LULC classes in 2030 based on two scenarios (A and B). Scenarios A predicts the LULC classes based on the classified images of 1984 and 1998, whereas scenarios B estimates the LULC classes based on the classified images of 1998 and 2013.

This research focuses on the nexus between LULC alterations and variations in LST and air temperature (T-air), with a specific emphasis on the intensified SUHI effect in Kharkiv, Ukraine. Employing an integrated approach, this study analyzes time-series data from Landsat and MODIS satellites, alongside T-air climate records, utilizing machine learning techniques and linear regression analysis. Key findings indicate a statistically significant upward trend in T-air and LST during the summer months from 1984 to 2023, with a notable positive correlation between T-air and LST across both datasets. MODIS data exhibit a stronger correlation (R-2 = 0.879) compared to Landsat (R-2 = 0.663). The application of a supervised classification through Random Forest algorithms and vegetation indices on LULC data reveals significant alterations: a 70.3% increase in urban land and a decrement in vegetative cover comprising a 15.5% reduction in dense vegetation and a 62.9% decrease in sparse vegetation. Change detection analysis elucidates a 24.6% conversion of sparse vegetation into urban land, underscoring a pronounced trajectory towards urbanization. Temporal and seasonal LST variations across different LULC classes were analyzed using kernel density estimation (KDE) and boxplot analysis. Urban areas and sparse vegetation had the smallest average LST fluctuations, at 2.09 degrees C and 2.16 degrees C, respectively, but recorded the most extreme LST values. Water and dense vegetation classes exhibited slightly larger fluctuations of 2.30 degrees C and 2.24 degrees C, with the bare land class showing the highest fluctuation 2.46 degrees C, but fewer extremes. Quantitative analysis with the application of Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests across various LULC classes substantiated the normality of LST distributions p > 0.05 for both monthly and annual datasets. Conversely, the Shapiro-Wilk test validated the normal distribution hypothesis exclusively for monthly data, indicating deviations from normality in the annual data. Thresholded LST classifies urban and bare lands as the warmest classes at 39.51 degrees C and 38.20 degrees C, respectively, and classifies water at 35.96 degrees C, dense vegetation at 35.52 degrees C, and sparse vegetation 37.71 degrees C as the coldest, which is a trend that is consistent annually and monthly. The analysis of SUHI effects demonstrates an increasing trend in UHI intensity, with statistical trends indicating a growth in average SUHI values over time. This comprehensive study underscores the critical role of remote sensing in understanding and addressing the impacts of climate change and urbanization on local and global climates, emphasizing the need for sustainable urban planning and green infrastructure to mitigate UHI effects.",land surface temperature,land use/land cover,Landsat,MODIS,air temperature,urban heat island,surface urban heat island,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,linear trend,,,,,,,,,,,

The study compared the classification performance of two machine learning algorithms, i.e., Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF). The time-varying response of LULC transition on groundwater dynamics was investigated using a 3-D numerical groundwater flow model (MODFLOW-NWT). The MODFLOW-NWT model was calibrated and validated with the observed hydraulic heads. The results indicated that RF outperformed SVM in overall classification during the testing period. The LULC of the command area revealed a seven-fold increase in built-up area from 19.12 km(2) in 2000 to 133.72 km(2) in 2018. Further, the Boro rice cultivated area has increased from 39.2% to 56.4% of the command area during the study period.

Exploring how LULC and ESs change spatially across urban hierarchical levels and understanding the possible mechanisms can promote the sustainable planning of urban landscapes. Objectives By mapping the spatial patterns of LULC and ESs in the three largest urban agglomerations of China, this study aimed to (1) identify the scaling relations of LULC and ESs across different urban hierarchical levels, (2) explore the possible mechanisms of these two types of spatial scaling, and (3) examine how the scaling relations of ESs relate to LULC and the policy implications.

Then, scalograms were used to quantify the scaling relations of LULC and ESs with respect to changing spatial extent. Results Developed land and cropland exhibited the most predictable responses with changing spatial extent. Compared to other ESs, provisioning services were the most predictable. The predictable scaling relations of ESs at different urban hierarchical levels fell into two general types: power laws at the city proper level and exponential relationships at the metropolitan region and urban agglomeration levels. Conclusions The scaling relations of both LULC and ESs varied across urban hierarchical levels. The spatial scaling of ESs was closely related to LULC patterns.

An estimation of the land use/cover changes and their ecological responses could help to understand the regional ecosystem dynamics under various human demands and provide the scientific basis for managing and regulating ecosystems. In this paper, we analysed the spatial-temporal variations in land use/cover types and systematically quantified the relationships between these changes and environmental variables in the Three Gorges Reservoir area. Our results revealed that forestland coverage increased linearly to 53.48%, and that of construction land increased exponentially from 0.25% to 2.75% during 1990-2015. The land use/cover changes exhibited two distinct transformation phases: before and after impoundment. The mutual transformations among vegetation types were significant before 2000, while the forest, water and construction land coverages increased continuously by occupying cropland after 2000. The land use/cover changes were significantly correlated with environmental variables and were sensitive to three topographic variables namely, elevation, surface-height fluctuation and slope. The vegetation dynamics were easily affected by the complex and rugged topography. Moreover, the responses of land use/cover changes varied among topographic variables. The two parameters estimated in the multiple linear regression, elevation and slope, were - 0.164 and - 0.268 for forestland change, -0.391 and 0.378 for water area change, and -0.068 and -0.061 for construction land change. Forest cover was so larger in the regions of higher elevation and steeper slope that afforestation occurred in the regions of moderate elevation and slope. Urbanization and impoundment mainly occurred in the regions of lower elevation, and the regions of steeper slope were more easily submerged, while urbanization mainly occurred in the regions of gentler slope. Therefore, the land use/cover changes due to ecological protection and economic development responded to the interactions among environmental variables and was targeted to different regions to reconcile the land use conflicts, providing a reference for ecosystem management in ecologically vulnerable areas.",Land use/cover change,Landsat imagery,Three Gorges Reservoir area,Human activities,Environmental effect,,,"Zhou, Zhixiang","Teng, Mingjun","Wang, Pengcheng",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we used the land cover map classified in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region as an example and investigated the impact of two parameters in the bootstrap resampling method on the assessment of land cover classification accuracy: the number of validation points and the number of bootstrap resampling times. Varying these two parameters can help diagnose the accuracy of remote sensing classifications of land cover. The main conclusions are as follows. First, the number of validation points required to achieve a stabilized accuracy estimate varies among land cover types. It indicates not only the level of homogeneity of the land cover type but also the level of difficulty associated with classifying it. Second, it is not necessary to have a very large number of bootstrap resampling times to estimate the classification accuracy - 50 was sufficient.

Supervised classification with the maximum likelihood method was used to classify the images into appropriate classes. Findings revealed different land-use changes with fluctuations in values for each index with an overall accuracy of the classified images ranging from 88% to 96% respectively. Hence these indices are reliable for mapping and monitoring land use/cover changes in mining areas over a large extent.",Geospatial indices,Land use/land cover,Mining,Monitoring,Welkom-Virginia goldfields,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, few used sketch maps to obtain information from the point of view of the survey respondent about the spatial organization of land use and infrastructure. We developed a method of creating sketch maps with respondents to describe their properties.

With the availability of large amounts of SITS it is possible to use supervised deep learning techniques such as Transformer models to analyse the Earth's surface at global scale and with high spatial and temporal resolution. While most approaches for land cover classification focus on the generation of a mono-temporal output map, we extend established deep learning models to multi-temporal input and output: using images acquired at different epochs we generate one output map for each input timestep. This has the advantage that the temporal change of land cover can be monitored. In addition, features conflicting over time are not averaged. We extend the Swin Transformer for SITS and introduce a new spatio-temporal transformer block (ST-TB) that extracts spatial and temporal features. We combine the ST-TB with the swin transformer block (STB) that is used in parallel for the individual input timesteps to extract spatial features. Furthermore, we investigate the usage of a temporal position encoding and different patch sizes. The latter is used to merge neighbouring pixels in the input embedding. Using SITS from Sentinel-2, the classification of land cover is improved by +1.8% in the mean F1-Score when using the ST-TB in the first stage of the Swin Transformer compared to a Swin Transformer without the ST-TB layer and by +1,6% compared to fully convolutional approaches.

It has caused the gradual decline of the natural vegetation and rapid increase of the impervious surface, which leads to the heat storage capacity of the urban surface being on the rise. There is a land surface temperature (LST) difference between the urban center and surrounding areas and it creates the urban heat island phenomenon (UHI). This study used Landsat 4, 5, and Landsat 8 satellite image data from 1990 to 2020 with the GIS algorithms on ENVI and ArcGIS to analyze and estimate the correlation between the LULC and the LST in HCMC. The Kappa coefficients of the LULC classifications were all over 0.8 in 1990 - 2020 period.

The first two regression models were constructed with area percentages of land covers as independent variables and soil erosion modulus or soil loss rate as dependent variables. The third one was built with soil erosion modulus as dependent variable and area percentage of the four erosion intensity classes as independent variables. Results showed that for flat and slope fields, forests, shrubs, abandoned fields, and other land covers, percentage of soil loss were -6%, 89%, -4%, 11%, 12%, and -3%, and area percentage of erosion were 1%, 72%, 0%, 18%, 9%, and 0%. The slope fields were the main source of soil loss. In contrast, flat crop fields, forests and other land covers could conserve soil from eroding. Changing land covers and reducing area of slope fields to 7% and of abandoned fields to 0%, were proposed as a management strategy for soil conservation in the watersheds. As completion of the land cover conversion, percentages of the land covers should be 35%, 7%, 5%, 45%, 0%, and 8% for flat and slope fields, forests, shrubs, abandoned fields, and other land covers.

To determine land cover dynamics, 1994 and 2007 Landsat images were used. A maximum likelihood classification for each image was computed for identification of land cover variables. Trends in land cover change depict a decline in post-transfer activities with agricultural cropland decreasing from 78.04 ha in 1994 to 20.43 ha in 2007. Inadvertently, land under fallow and shrubs increased by 6% and 30%, respectively. This accelerated decline of agricultural activity is mainly attributable to change of land ownership and management skills from the commercial farmers to the inexperienced land claimants. Results suggest that quantification of the changes in land use and land cover types can be very useful in assessing environmental and social condition of the land reform project.

A.",Impact of Land Cover Change on Climate and El Nino in Australia,,2007,3,"Climate impacts of land cover change (LCC) are still a subject of discussion despite growing evidence that LCC affects global and regional climates (Zhao et al. 2001; Timbal and Arblaster 2006; Pielke et al. 2002; Narisma and Pitman 2003). To investigate the climate impacts of LCC, this paper presents results for two sets of 10 member ensemble experiments using CSIRO atmospheric GCM.The CSIRO climate model is a fully coupled atmosphere, land surface, sea ice and ocean model, with a model horizontal resolution of similar to 1.8 degrees grid increment and 18 vertical levels. In this study, we used the uncoupled version where ocean and sea ice components were represented by observed seasonally varying sea surface temperatures and sea ice data. We quantified changes in land surface parameters and impacts on mean climate from the pre-European (1788) to modern day (1990) land covers and impact of ENSO on the strength of surface temperature anomalies during second half of 20(th) century. Pre-clearing land surface parameters were generated by extrapolating modern-day values of remnant native vegetation to the pre-European extents of each land cover class. The extrapolation was performed for Australian continent at 8 km spatial resolution and the fine scale parameters then aggregated using Shuttleworth's (1991) approach to coarse resolution aggregated for model.The largest differences between pre-European and modern day surface parameters were in eastern Queensland, southwest Western Australia, and New South Wales/Victoria. In eastern Queensland, vegetation fraction and leaf area index during the summer decreased by 14% and 20% respectively. This corresponded to a surface albedo increase of 4%. Stomatal resistance increased by 3% and surface roughness decreased by 54%. In New South Wales/Victoria, similarly large decreases in vegetation fraction (19%) and LAI (23%) caused an albedo increase of 7%, while there was a corresponding 46% reduction in surface roughness. In southwest Western Australia, replacement of native woodlands with predominantly winter grains and crops resulted in a modest decrease in vegetation fraction (5%) and LAI (2%) during winter, while stomatal resistance decreased by 15%. However, surface albedo increased by 14% due to higher reflectance of sandy soils. Overall, the largest impact of land cover change on land surface parameters occurred in eastern Australia.Our results showed that modification of vegetation in eastern Queensland and New South Wales/Victoria contributed to increases in area-averaged surface temperatures of 0.19 degrees C and 0.63 degrees C in the present-day compared to the pre-European values. In New South Wales/Victoria, area-averaged total rainfall decreased by 2.5%, while in eastern Queensland there was a rainfall decrease of 5.2%. The impact of LCC on the winter climate of southwest Western Australia was a cooling of 0.14 degrees C, even though albedo increased. This coincided with a small increase in winter rainfall by 0.6% and soil moisture by about 12%. Our winter response of increased rainfall is at odds with Pitman et al (2004) and Timbal and Arblaster (2006) although annual average rainfall, showing a decline of 0.24%, is consistent with their results. Nevertheless, even this decline is too small to be attributable to the influence of LCC. Further studies are needed to address the exact cause of this discrepancy.Composites of summer surface temperatures during the five strongest El Nino and La Nina episodes from 1950-2003 showed significant warming under present-day land cover conditions. However, increases in surface temperatures in eastern Australia were the highest during both episodes. On average, the strongest warming (approximate to 3.6 degrees C) occurred during 1982/1983 El Nino in eastern Australia and southwest Western Australia, the regions of largest land cover change. The surface temperature were similar for 1997/98 and 2002/2003 El Nino years, indicating the land surface forcings act to amplify the effect of El Nino on the surface climate of Australia.The findings indicate that replacing the native woody vegetation with crops and grazing has resulted in significant changes in regional climates, with a shift to warmer and drier conditions, especially in eastern Australia, the nation's major agricultural production zone.",Land Cover Change,El Nino,Droughts,Climate Impacts,,,,"McGowan, H.

Satellite observed surface albedo during the presence of ground snow period was 2-4 times higher than that observed during snow-free periods.

However, no research has been conducted in the Shigar district to investigate LULC changes, particularly the correlation between LST and vegetation/snow cover at higher elevated regions. Therefore, this study was carried out in the Shigar district of Gilgit Baltistan Region, Pakistan, due to its extreme climatic variability. In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal variability of LULC and its impacts on LST in the Shigar district, utilizing Landsat data from 1993 to 2020. To study the variable LST, thermal bands of Landsat imagery were used. LULC was determined by classifying the images using the supervised maximum likelihood classification method. The vegetation and snow cover were also extracted by using the indices of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI), respectively. The results showed that the Shigar district had experienced severe land cover variations in the years of 1993, 2003, 2010, and 2020. Specifically, the agricultural area gradually increased from 1993 to 2020. The forest/vegetation cover also increased in the study area. In contrast, snow cover and water bodies were drastically reduced during this period. The overall vegetation increased within the region and the LST values were found to be decreased in 2003 and 2010, whereas the LST rose in 2020. In addition, the correlation between NDVI and LST was found to be significant negative in areas with high vegetation cover. Conversely, it was weakly positive in other areas with minor vegetations. These findings suggest that green cover plays a crucial role in regulating temperature. Additionally, a negative correlation between LST and NDSI was observed with rising elevation. This study will be helpful in landscape and urban planning, watershed management, and policymaking for climate change variability.",Land use land cover (LULC),Land surface temperature (LST),Normal difference vegetation index (NDVI),Normal difference snow index (NDSI),Elevation,Landsat,Shigar,"Khan, Tariq Masood Ali","Khan, Faisal Ahmed","Sulman, Nasir","Tian, Hongzhen","Liu, Dong","Fang, Hua",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We estimated the OMR trends for the 1979-2003 period from the US Historical Climate Network (USHCN), and the NCEP-NCAR North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR). We used a new mean square differences (MSDs)-based assessment for the comparisons between temperature anomalies from observations and interpolated reanalysis data. Trends of monthly mean temperature anomalies show a strong agreement, especially between adjusted USHCN and NARR (r = 0.9 on average) and demonstrate that NARR captures the climate variability at different time scales.OMR trend results suggest that, unlike findings from studies based on the global reanalysis (NCEP/NCAR reanalysis), NARR often has a larger warming trend than adjusted observations (on average, 0.28 and 0.27 degrees C/decade respectively). OMR trends were found to be sensitive to land cover types. We analysed decadal OMR trends as a function of land types using the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and new National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 1992-2001 Retrofit Land Cover Change. The magnitude of OMR trends obtained from the NLDC is larger than the one derived from the 'static' AVHRR. Moreover, land use conversion often results in more warming than cooling.Overall, our results confirm the robustness of the OMR method for detecting non-climatic changes at the station level, evaluating the impacts of adjustments performed on raw observations, and most importantly, providing a quantitative estimate of additional warming trends associated with LULC changes at local and regional scales. As most of the warming trends that we identify can be explained on the basis of LULC changes, we suggest that in addition to considering the greenhouse gases-driven radiative forcings, multi-decadal and longer climate models simulations must further include LULC changes.

Yola North Local Government Area (Yola North LGA) of Adamawa state, Nigeria, has experienced tremendous changes in its land use and land cover (LULC) over the past two decades due to the influx of people from rural areas seeking for the benefits of its economic activities. The goal of this research is to develop an efficient and accurate framework for continuous monitoring of land use and land cover (LULC) change and quantify the transformation in land use and land cover pattern over a specific period (between 2002 and 2022). Land sat images of 2002, 2012, and 2022 were obtained, and the Support Vector Machine classification method was utilized to stratify the images. Land Change Modeler (LCM) tool in Idrissi Selva software was then used to analyze the LULC change. SVM produced a good classification result for all three years, with 2022 having the highest overall accuracy of 95.5%, followed by 2002 with 90% and 2012 with 87.7% which indicates the validity of the algorithm for future predictions. The results showed that severe land changes have occurred over the course of two decades in built-up (37.32%), vegetation (forest, scrubland, and grassland) (-3.27%), bare surface (-33.47%), and water bodies (-0.59%). Such changes in LULC could lead to agricultural land lost and reduced food supply. This research develops a robust framework for continuous land use monitoring, utilizing machine learning and geo-spatial data for urban planning, natural resource management, and environmental conservation.

Landsat TM and ETM imagery were used to produce LULC classification maps for both years using a hybrid supervised/unsupervised approach. LULC changes were measured using landscape metrics and from-to change maps created by post-classification change detection. Contrary to expectations, tropical upper wet montane forest increased despite being threatened by human-induced fires and cattle grazing of the highland grasslands inside the park. Within the park's buffer zone, tropical moist forest remnants were fragmented into more numerous and smaller patches between 1987 and 2001; this was in part due to conversion into agricultural land.

This study aimed at modeling the spatiotemporal LULC dynamics of the Abbay River Basin (ARB) between 1994 and 2056. A hybrid image spectral recognition approach was used to identify eight LULC categories: agriculture (AG), bareland (BL), forest (FT), grassland (GL), settlement (ST), shrubland (SH), wetland (WL), and water body (WB). The supervised image classification approach with a maximum likelihood classifier algorithm was used to classify the images into the identified LULC categories. Then, the integration of Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network and Markov Chain Model in Land Change Modeler was used to model and analyze LULC dynamics. The findings revealed that ARB has experienced significant LULC dynamics. Between 1994 and 2021, AG, BL, SH, and WL showed decreasing trend by 34.5 km(2), 1 km(2), 200 km(2), and 0.1 km(2) annual rate of change while FT, GL, ST, and WB showed an increasing trend with 166 km(2), 0.5 km(2), 20 km(2) and 50 km(2) annual rate of change respectively.

After assessing current land use changes and future predictions, their impact on land surface temperature and urban heat island effect is measured using machine learning via Multi-Layer Perceptron-Markov Chain, Artificial Neural Network and Cellular Automata. Significant changes in land use land cover were observed in the last two decades. The built-up area expanded greatly (874ha) while agriculture land (-687ha) and barren land (-253ha) show decreasing trend. The water bodies were found the lowest changes (57ha) and vegetation cover got the largest proportion in all the years. This green-grey conversion in the last two decades (8.7%) and prospect along the main corridors show the gravity of unplanned urban growth at the cost of vegetation and agricultural land (-6.8%). The land surface temperature and urban heat island effect shows a strong positive correlation between urbanization and vegetation removal. The simulation results presented in this study confirm that by 2032, the city will face a 5 degrees C high mean temperature based on historical patterns, which could potentially lead to more challenges associated with urban heat island if no appropriate measures are taken.

Our results provide baseline information to urban managers and planners to understand the increasing trends of land surface temperature in response to land cover changes. The study is important for urban resource management, sustainable development policies, and actions to mitigate the heat island effect. It will further asset the broader audience to understand the impact of land use land cover changes on the land surface temperature and urban heat island effect in the light of historic pattern and machine learning approach.",land use land cover,land surface temperature,urban heat island,artificial neural network,Markov chain,,,"Song, Jinxi","Zafar, Zeeshan","Shiyan, Zhai","Yaochen, Qin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We address this problem by deploying three different Deep Neural Network Ensemble (DNNE) methods and creating a comparative analysis for the LCLU classification task. DNNE enables improvement of the performance of DNNs by ensuring the diversity of the models that are combined. Thus, enhances the generalizability of the models and produces more robust and generalizable outcomes for LCLU classification tasks.

Simultaneously, as spatial resolution advances, there is a corresponding escalation in the required granularity of land cover and land use (LCLU) categories. The coarse classes identified necessitate further refinement into more detailed categories. For instance, the 'built-up' class can be subdivided into specific categories such as squares, stadiums, and airports. These refined LCLU classifications are better equipped to support diverse domains. Nonetheless, most studies simply adopt methods initially designed for coarse LCLU when addressing the challenging refined LCLU segmentation. Few studies have considered the inherent relationships between coarse and refined LCLU, overlooking the potential exploitation of the numerous recently released LCLU products. To better leverage this prior knowledge, we propose the Global Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (GHGCN). The GHGCN introduces a heterogeneous graph and excels in establishing relationships between coarse and refined LCLU, which can extract long-distance dependencies more effectively than convolutional neural networks. Furthermore, this model is performed end-to-end, eliminating the necessity for presegmentation and facilitating training acceleration.

One of the more serious impacts of urbanization is the formation of urban heat island (UHI) effect. Asansol-Durgapur Development Region is the second largest urban identity in West Bengal just after Kolkata urban agglomeration. Rapid urban growth in Asansol-Durgapur Development Region has brought about fast transformation of LULC pattern which in turn significantly affect the LST. Fast transformation of land use and land cover pattern brought significant changes in LST. The study attempts to examine the influence of land use/land cover (LULC) on land surface temperature in Asansol-Durgapur Development Region by employing multi temporal satellite data. LST is extracted in three different phases seasonally (e.g. winter, summer and post-monsoon periods) by using LANDSAT 4-5 TM and LANDSAT 8 OLI over the period of 1993, 2009 and 2015. Results depict that LST increases 0.06 degrees C/year in winter and 0.43 degrees C/year in summer periods respectively and the difference of surface radiant temperature is significant over existing different LULC units. The result of the study revealed that the impervious surface, industrial area and coal mining area has high surface temperature (38 degrees C) and water bodies and vegetation cover has experienced low surface temperature (27 degrees C). The study also examined causality of association between LST and deriving factors such as NDVI, NDBI and NDWI. The result reveals that LST maximally controls by impervious surface (r = 0.95) than water bodies (r = 0.62) and vegetation cover (r = 0.61).

Limited by coarser resolutions, most of the traditional LULC classifications that are based on moderate resolution remote sensing images focus on the spectral features of a single pixel. Inspired by the spatial evaluation methods in landscape ecology, this study proposed a new method to extract neighborhood characteristics around a pixel for moderate resolution images. 3 landscape-metric-like indexes, i.e., mean index, standard deviation index, and distance weighted value index, were defined as adjacent region features to include the surrounding environmental characteristics. The effects of the adjacent region features and the different feature set configurations on improving the LULC classification were evaluated by a series of well-controlled LULC classification experiments using K nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers on a Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image. When the adjacent region features were added, the overall accuracies of both the classifiers were higher than when only spectral features were used. For the KNN and SVM classifiers that used only spectral features, the overall accuracies of the LULC classification were 85.45% and 88.87%, respectively, and the accuracies were improved to 94.52% and 96.97%.

Due to the economic expansion beginning in the early 1990s in Iran and its resulting desertification, Zagros has lost numerous forests over the last 30 years. To overcome this issue, Zagros Forest Preservation Plan (ZFPP) has been under implementation in Northwestern Iran since 2003 to reduce forest destruction and attract the peoples participation. However, it faced shortcomings caused by a variety of factors including insufficient funds, incomplete preservation, and unsuitable organization during implementation. This research aims to study the effect of ZFPP on forest loss in Sardasht County as a representative of Iranian Northern Zagros Forests. A series of Landsat images were used to analyze the forest loss before ZFPP implementation (1993-2002), after 10 years of implementation (2002-2012), and finally after its revision (2012-2016). Land Change Modeler (LCM) was employed to detect land cover changes for land cover prediction in 2024. We used land cover maps between 2002 and 2012 for calibration. We then compared the predicted land cover map from LCM with actual land cover map in 2016 for validation. The results indicated that 3330, 4562, and 1234 ha of forestlands converted to agricultural lands, rangelands, and built-up areas during 1993-2002, 2002-2012, and 2012-2016, with annual deforestation rates of -0.40%, -0.52% and -0.36%, respectively. The highest deforestation rate was observed between 2002 and 2012 because of the destructive effects of population growth.

The purpose was to analyze the relationship between land use/cover change (LULC) and the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) and give results regarding the structure of the UHI in the city of Tehran. Using Landsat-5 TM data from 1986 to 2010, we quantified the spatiotemporal variability of the SUHI and LULC in the city of Tehran. The spatial distribution of land surface temperature (LST) showed the most extensive SUHI as spatially located in the western and southwestern areas of Tehran in 1986. In 2010, the spatial extent of SUHI had increased. The occurrence of LULC changes in the southern, southwestern, and especially the western parts of Tehran have played the most important role in expanding and intensifying the SUHI effect. These areas experienced two major alterations: (a) The area lost about 14 km(2) from green cover; and (b) the industrial and commercial land use, and transportation network extended significantly in these areas. Based on LULC and LST distribution patterns, barren lands, industrial and commercial land use, and transportation network have the major roles in the formation and expansion of the SUHI effect in Tehran. The SUHI of Tehran, like that of other arid or semi-arid cities, does not exhibit the classical pattern of SUHI: that is, the hot spots usually are not found in the downtown, as occurs in humid climates. Rather, the SUHI tends to situate over desert areas or barren lands that surround these cities. Therefore, an inversion of the standard SUHI phenomenon during daytime has been observed in Tehran. Research conducted in arid and semi-arid cities suggests that we should refine our point of view on the concept of the UHI in such cities and consider this issue in future studies.",surface urban heat island,land use/cover change,land surface temperature,remote sensing,Tehran,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The previous studies mainly relate the land use/cover of the entire region to the water quality at the monitoring sites, but the water quality at monitoring sites did not totally reflect the water environment of the entire basin. In this study, the land use/cover was monitored on Google Earth Engine in Tang-Pu Reservoir basin, China. In order to reflect the water quality of the whole study area, the spatial distribution of the determinants for water quality there, i.e., the total nitrogen and total phosphorus (TN & TP), were simulated by the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The redundancy analysis explored the correlations between land use/cover pattern and simulated TN & TP. The results showed that: (1) From 2009 to 2019, forest was the dominant land cover, and there was little land use/cover change. The landscape fragmentation increased, and the connectivity decreased. (2) About 25% TP concentrations and nearly all the TN concentrations at the monitoring points did not reach drinking water standard, which means nitrogen and phosphorus pollution were the most serious problems. The highest output per unit TN & TP simulated by SWAT were 44.50 kg/hm(2) and 9.51 kg/hm(2) and occurred in areas with highly fragile landscape patterns. (3) TN & TP correlated positively with cultivated and construction land but negatively with forest. The correlation between forest and TN & TP summited at 500-700-m buffer and construction land at 100-m buffer. As the buffer size increased, the correlation between the cultivated land, and the TN weakened, while the correlation with the TP increased.

We use new, spatially explicit land availability data in conjunction with a model sensitivity analysis to estimate the effects of additional land protection on land use and land cover. The land availability data include protected land and agricultural suitability and is incorporated into the Moirai land data system for initializing the Global Change Analysis Model. Overall, decreasing land availability is relatively inefficient at preserving undeveloped land while having considerable regional land-use impacts. Current amounts of protected area have little effect on land and crop production estimates, but including the spatial distribution of unsuitable (i.e., unavailable) land dramatically shifts bioenergy production from high northern latitudes to the rest of the world, compared with uniform availability. This highlights the importance of spatial heterogeneity in understanding and managing land change.

Regional bioenergy land may be reduced (increased) by up to 46% (36%), cropland reduced by up to 61%, pasture reduced by up to 100%, and harvested forest reduced by up to 35%. Only a few regions show notable gains in some undeveloped land types of up to 36%.

The areas with slightly improved ecological quality accounted for 31.26% of the total land area of Xinjiang, whereas only 3.55% of the land area was classified as having a slightly worsen (3.16%) or worsen (0.39%) ecological quality. The vast majority of the deterioration in ecological quality mainly occurred in the barren areas Temperature, precipitation, closed shrublands, grasslands and savannas were the top five environmental factors affecting the changes in RSEI. Environmental factors were allocated different weights for different RSEI categories. In general, the recovery of ecological quality in Xinjiang has been controlled by climate and land use/land cover during the last two decades and policy-driven ecological restoration is therefore crucial. Rapid monitoring of inland ecological quality using the GEE platform is projected to aid in the advancement of the comprehensive assessment of the UN SDGs.",ecological quality,land use,land cover,spatiotemporal change,remote sensing ecological index (RSEI),Google Earth Engine,Xinjiang,Qin Shaofeng,Zhang Zhe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spatial heterogeneity in these landscapes hinders our understanding about the impacts of changes in human activity on ecological processes, such as wildfire. The use of spatially-explicit models that simulate processes at fine scales should aid the investigation of spatial patterns at the broader, landscape scale. Here, we present an agent-based model of agricultural land-use decision-making to examine the importance of land tenure and land use on future land cover. The model considers two 'types' of land-use decision-making agent with differing perspectives; 'commercial' agents that are perfectly economically rational, and 'traditional' agents that represent part-time or 'traditional' farmers that manage their land because of its cultural, rather than economic, value. The structure of the model is described and results are presented for various scenarios of initial landscape configuration. Land-use/cover maps produced by the model are used to examine how wildfire risk changes for each scenario. Results indicate that land tenure configuration influences trajectories of land use change. However, simulations for various initial land-use configurations and compositions converge to similar states when land-tenure structure is held constant. For the scenarios considered, mean wildfire risk increases relative to the observed landscape. Increases in wildfire risk are not spatially uniform however, varying according to the composition and configuration of land use types. These unexpected spatial variations in wildfire risk highlight the advantages of using a spatially-explicit agent-based model of land use/cover change.",Land Use/Cover Change,Land Tenure,Wildfire,Mediterranean-Type Ecosystem,Agriculture,Spatial Heterogeneity,,"Perry, George",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, processes for accurate land-cover classification over large regions are still evolving. We identified inconsistencies in the National Land Cover Dataset 1992, the most current and available representation of land cover for the conterminous United States. We also report means to address these inconsistencies in a bird-habitat model. We used a Geographic Information System (GIS) to position a regular grid (or lattice) over the upper midwestern United States and summarized the proportion of individual land covers in each cell within the lattice. These proportions were then mapped back onto the lattice, and the resultant lattice was compared to satellite paths, state borders, and regional map classification units. We observed mapping inconsistencies at the borders between mapping regions, states, and Thematic Mapper (TM) mapping paths in the upper midwestern United States, particularly related to grass I and-herbaceous, emergent-herbaceous wetland, and small-grain land covers. We attributed these discrepancies to differences in image dates between mapping regions, suboptimal image dates for distinguishing certain land-cover types, lack of suitable ancillary data for improving discrimination for rare land covers, and possibly differences among image interpreters. To overcome these inconsistencies for the purpose of modeling regional populations of birds, we combined grassland-herbaceous and pasture-hay land-cover classes and excluded the use of emergent-herbaceous and small-grain land covers. We recommend that users of digital land-cover data conduct similar assessments for other regions before using these data for habitat evaluation. Further, caution is advised in using these data in the analysis of regional land-cover change because it is not likely that future digital land-cover maps will repeat the same problems, thus resulting in biased estimates of change.",accuracy assessment,Geographic Information System,land cover,National Land Cover Dataset,NLCD,observer differences,remote sensing,"Fox, TJ","Suarez, MJ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Africa's anticipated population growth has serious implications for urban resource utilization and management, necessitating multi-level monitoring efforts that can inform planning and decision-making. Commonly, broad extent (e.g., country level) urban change analyses only examine a homogenous ""developed"" or ""built-up"" area, which may not capture patterns influenced by the heterogeneity of landscape features within urban areas. Contrarily, studies examining landscape heterogeneity at a finer resolution are typically limited in spatial extent (e.g., single city level). The goal of this study was to develop and test a hierarchical integrated mapping framework using globally available Earth Observation data (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, and nightlight imagery) and accessible methodologies to produce national-level land use (LU) and urban-level land cover (LC) map products which may support a range of global and local monitoring and planning initiatives. We test our multi-tier methodology across three rapidly urbanizing African countries for the 2016-2020 period: Ethiopia, Nigeria, and South Africa. The initial output of our methodology includes annual national land use maps (Tier 1) for the purpose of delineating the dynamic boundaries of individual urban areas and monitoring national LU change. To complement Tier 1 LU maps, we detailed urban heterogeneity through LC classifications within urban areas (Tier 2) delineated using Tier 1 LU maps. Based on country-optimized sets of selected features that leverage spatial/texture and temporal dimensions of available data, we obtained an overall map accuracy of between 65 and 80% for Tier 1 maps and between 60 and 80% for Tier 2 maps, dependent on the evaluation country, although with consistent performance across study years providing a solid foundation for monitoring changes. We demonstrate the potential applications for our products through various analyses, including urbanization-driven LU change, and examine LC urban patterns across the three African study countries. While our findings allude to general differences in urban patterns across national scales, further analyses are needed to better understand the complex drivers behind urban LC configurations and their change patterns across different countries, city sizes, and rates of urbanization.

Urban green space (UGS) can effectively mitigate this pollution. Despite their potential, strategies for effectively leveraging Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) optimization to combat PM2.5 remain largely unexplored. Ordinary least squares (OLS), geographically weighted regression (GWR) and multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) were employed to investigate the spatial heterogeneity relationship between UGS conversion and PM2.5 fluctuations across various scales and evolutionary stages, developing a multiscale practical framework for LULC synergy in combating air pollution. The areas of UGSs to/from other LULCs, PM2.5 concentrations and corresponding variation zones exhibited significant spatial clustering. These UGS conversions explained more than 65% of the PM2.5 changes in the study area, peaking at 76.4% explanatory power in the fourth stage. Compared to global spatial analysis (OLS: 0-0.48), local spatial regression analysis significantly improved the R-2 value (GWR: 0.32-0.75, MGWR: 0.48-0.90), but the fitting quality of local spatial regression analysis decreased with increasing scale, highlighting the importance of scale diagnosis. A 2 km scale was identified as optimal for assessing the spatial heterogeneity impact of UGS and other LULC conversions on PM2.5 changes. Conversion areas from water bodies and bare land to UGSs maintain stable local spatial properties at this scale (bandwidths: 44-99). Our research provides new insights into LULC management and planning, offering a coordinated approach to mitigating urban air pollution. Additionally, a practical framework was established for addressing spatially continuous variables such as PM2.5, revealing effective approaches for addressing urban environmental issues.",urban green space,land use and land cover,PM2.5,spatiotemporal evolution,synergy optimization,spatial heterogeneity,,"Jiang, Peiyi","Dai, Fei","Wang, Guowei",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such changes in coverage are fostering soil erosion, which is also affecting dam reservoirs, because of the increasing sediment yield entering the lake. The present study focuses on the Ethiopian Fincha watershed and takes advantage of the potentiality of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, to investigate how land use land cover changes impact soil erosion and the consequent sediment yield entering the Fincha Dam. The SWAT model was calibrated and validated using time series data of stream flow and sediment covering the period 1986-2008, and its performance was evaluated by looking at the coefficient of determination, Nash-Sutcliffe simulation efficiency, and per cent bias. Once validated, the SWAT model was applied to derive sediment yield for the future 30 years, based on forecasted land use land cover conditions. The results show that the mean annual soil loss rate increased from 32.51 t ha-1 in 1989 to 34.05 t ha-1 in 2004, reaching 41.20 t ha-1 in 2019. For the future, a higher erosion risk should be expected, with the annual soil loss rate forecasted to be 46.20 t ha-1 in 2030, 51.19 t ha-1 in 2040, and 53.98 t ha-1 in 2050. This soil erosion means that sediments transported to the Fincha Dam, located at the watershed outlet, increased significantly in the last 30 years (from 1.44 in 1989 to 2.75 mil t in 2019) and will have the same trend in the future (3.08-4.42 mil t in 2020 and 2050, respectively), therefore highly affecting the Fincha reservoir services in terms of reduction of water volume for irrigation and hydroelectric power generation. By providing possible medium/long-term scenarios, the present work can help land planners and decision-makers in developing future land management strategies based on actual projections, eventually aiming to reduce soil erosion at the watershed scale and guarantee the sustainable development of the Fincha region and its key hydraulic infrastructures.",Ethiopia,Fincha watershed,sediment yield,SWAT model,land use land cover (LULC),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While there are numerous studies analyzing the loss of arable land due to urban sprawl, less attention has been paid to the study of rural housing land in China. This paper develops a theoretical framework for rural housing land transition in China. It introduces a research method, which is using the spatial differentiation in regional development for compensating the deficiencies in time-series data, to analyze the rural housing land transition in the Transect of the Yangtse River (TYR). Detailed land-use data and socio-economic data from both research institutes and government departments were used to test the following hypothesis on rural housing land transition. We assume that rural housing in every region will undergo specific stages-the proportion of rural housing in the increase of total construction land will decline gradually with the development of the local economy, and the end of the transition corresponds to a new equilibrium between rural housing and other construction activities. Five regional types of rural housing land change were defined according to an aggregation index used to reflect landscape patterns. The outcomes indicated that the share of rural housing in the increase of total construction land declines gradually from the 'upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Yangtse River, i.e. from Ganzi-Yushu to Luzhou-Diqing, Enshi-Chongqing, Tongling-Yichang and to Shanghai-Chaohu. Each region is in a different phase of the rural housing land transition, which corresponds to a particular socio-economic developmental level. Finally, some policy implications were discussed by applying this research to land management issues. The authors argue that there are problems in the current rural housing land managerial system in China, and that the Central Government needs to define uniform regulations for rural housing according to regional socio-economic developmental level, physical conditions and rural housing land transition phase.

To achieve the research objectives, a confusion matrix using 548,117 test points in the conterminous United States was prepared to assess the accuracy by quantifying the cross-correspondence between the two datasets. Then statistical analyses were applied to the global maps to detect the appropriate Manning's roughness values associated with the LULC 2020-ESRI map. Compared to the NLCD 2019 dataset, the proposed Manning's roughness values for the LULC 2020-ESRI dataset were calibrated and validated using 2D flood modeling software (HEC-RAS V6.2) on nine randomly chosen catchments in the conterminous United States. This research's main results show that the LULC 2020-ESRI dataset achieves an overall accuracy of 72% compared to the NLCD 2019 dataset. The findings demonstrate that, when determining the appropriate Manning's roughness values for the LULC 2020-ESRI dataset, the weighted average technique performs better than the average method. The calibration and validation results of the proposed Manning's roughness values show that the overall Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in depth was 2.7 cm, and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in depth was 5.32 cm. The accuracy of the computed peak flow value using LULC 2020-ESRI was with an average error of 5.22% (2.0% min. to 8.8% max.) compared to the computed peak flow values using the NLCD 2019 dataset. Finally, a reference to Manning's roughness values for the LULC 2020-ESRI dataset was developed to help use the globally available land-use/land-cover dataset to build 2D flood models with an acceptable accuracy worldwide.",land cover,land-use maps,NLCD,LULC ESRI,confusion matrix,roughness layers,accuracy assessment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,flood modeling,HEC-RAS,,,,,,,,,,

This is particularly relevant as most urban trees are located on private property while their canopies maintain ecosystem services that constitute public goods. Thus, municipalities establish institutions in the form of canopy cover goals and various policies to incentivize private actions to meet those goals. However, urban land use, as governed by municipal zoning policies, plays a role in the abundance, distribution, and potential future location of urban trees independent of policies meant specifically to manage canopy. For instance, previous research finds that lands zoned for residential and park development have the highest canopy cover relative to other land uses. Yet, little research has explored whether this conclusion holds across scales of analysis and how it might influence our understanding of potential canopy cover and relative canopy cover. Thus, we ask, does the nature of the relationship between zoning and canopy cover change between aggregated and disaggregated zoning scales and how might this knowledge improve the sustainability of urban forest management? To answer this question, we classified high resolution National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) images of Bloomington, Indiana land cover and compared existing, potential and relative canopy cover across aggregated and disaggregated zones. Results demonstrate an important exception to the oft-cited theory that residential lands have higher canopy cover, a conclusion that our data supports only at the scale of an aggregated interpretation of zoning. At a disaggregated scale, residential high density zones are significantly different than all other residential zones and more akin to commercial zones in terms of all canopy metrics. For urban forest managers and urban planners, this suggests the relevance of fine-scale variation in land-use policies and related canopy cover policies. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

Therefore, mapping and predicting spatiotemporal LULC transformation is crucial in effectively managing the built environment toward achieving Sustainable Development Goal 11, which seeks to make cities all-inclusive, sustainable, and reliable. The study aims to examine the change dynamics of LULC in Kano Metropolis, Nigeria from 1991 to 2020 and predict the city's future land uses over the next 15 and 30 years, i.e., 2035 and 2050. The maximum likelihood algorithm (MLA) of the supervised classification method was utilized to classify the study area's land uses using Landsat satellite data and various geographic information system (GIS) techniques. A hybrid simulation model comprising cellular automata and Markov chain (CA-Markov) was then employed in validating and modeling the change dynamics of future LULC. The model integrated the spatial continuity of the CA model with the Markov chain's ability to address the limitations of individual models in simulating long-term land use prediction. The study revealed substantial changes in the historical LULC pattern of Kano metropolis from 1991 to 2020.

Models such as k-nearest neighbour (kNN), support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), and random forests (RF) have been used effectively to classify LULC types at a range of geographical scales. However, ML models have not been widely applied in African tropical regions due to methodological challenges that arise from relying on the coarse-resolution satellite images available for these areas. In this study, we compared the performance of four ML algorithms (kNN, SVM, ANN and RF) applied to LULC monitoring within the Mayo Rey department, North Province, Cameroon. We used satellite data from the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) combined with 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images of northern Cameroon for November 2000 and November 2020. Our results showed that all four classification algorithms produced relatively high accuracy (overall classification accuracy >80%), with the RF model (> 90% classification accuracy) outperforming the kNN, SVM, and ANN models. We found that approximately 7% of all forested areas (dense forest and woody savanna) were converted to other land cover types between 2000 and 2020; this forest loss is particularly associated with an expansion of both croplands and built-up areas.

However, reliable data are often not immediately available, and are obtained through time-consuming manual labor. One potential solution to this problem is the use of already available classification maps, which may not be the true ground truth and may contain noise from multiple possible sources. This is also true for the classification maps of the MapBiomas project, which provides land use and land cover (LULC) maps on a yearly basis, classifying the Amazon basin into more than 24 classes based on the Landsat data. In this study, we utilize the Sentinel-2 data with a higher spatial resolution in conjunction with the MapBiomas maps to evaluate a proposed noise removal method and to improve classification results. We introduce a novel noise detection method that relies on identifying anchor points in feature space through clustering with self-organizing maps (SOM). The pixel label is relabeled using nearest neighbor rules, or can be removed if it is unknown. A challenge in this approach is the quantification of noise in such a real-world dataset. To overcome this problem, highly reliable validation sets were manually created for quantitative performance assessment. The results demonstrate a significant increase in overall accuracy compared to MapBiomas labels, from 79.85% to 89.65%. Additionally, we trained the L2HNet using both MapBiomas labels and the filtered labels from our approach.

The feed deficit management strategies of households are also changing significantly from mobility to herd management and feed conservation in the pastoral areas; from mobility to feed conservation and purchasing of feed in the agro-pastoral areas and from transhumance to feed conservation and purchase of feed in the mixed crop-livestock areas. Hence feed resources and their availability vary with time and eco-environments indicating the need for the development of eco-environment/site specific feed management strategies in order to support productive stock in the study areas and similar eco-environments.

Based on satellite imagery and geographical and climatological data, this study analyzes the patterns of land surface temperature (LST) and land use/land cover (LULC) in Hong Kong and the seasonal variations of the relationships between them. Remote sensing, Geographical Information System (GIS) and statistical methods are used for analysis. The results indicate that LST is significantly affected by LULC types. The ordinary least squared (OLS) models indicate that LST is positively related to Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) and Normalized Difference Bareness Index (NDBaI) but negatively related to Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), elevation and wind speed. The Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model indicates that LST is negatively related to NDVI and elevation. The magnitudes of the influences of indices vary with the season. The GWR model demonstrates better fitness compared to the OLS models. Regression results on the GIS maps reveal the fitness of the models across the study area and the spatial variations of the regression coefficients.

To solve small inter-class differences and large intra-class differences between the vegetation and background, we introduce a vegetation-feature-sensitive focus perception (FP) module. Considering the intrinsic properties of vegetation objects, we established an adaptive context inference (ACI) model under a supervised setting that includes a context model to represent relationships between a center pixel and its neighbors under semantic constraints, as well as the spatial structures of vegetation features. Comparative experiments on the ZY-3 and Gaofen Image Dataset (GID) datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed automatic vegetation extraction model against the baseline Deeplab v3 + model. Taking precision, kappa coefficient, mean intersection over union (miou), precision rate, and F1-score as the evaluation indexes, the results showed an improvement in the precision by at least 1.44% and miou by 2.47%, over the baseline Deeplab v3 + model. In addition, the ACI module improved the precision and miou by 2% and 3.88%, and the FP module improved the precision and miou by 1.13% and 1.65%.

The key findings are as follows: (1)The northern region of Egypt and the Nasser Reservoir exhibited different trends across the ecological functional zones.From 1985 to 2020, the northern region of Egypt is characterized by an increase in arable land and impervious surface, the Nasser Reservoir area is distinguished by the expansion of water and a reduction in sand.(2) Key land transfer patterns vary significantly between the ecological functional zones of the northern region of Egypt and the Nasser Reservoir. From 1985 to 2020, the Egypt's northern region experienced significant shifts between arable land, sand, and impervious surfaces. The conversion of arable land to impervious surfaces represented 2.41% of the total arable land transfer area, while sand converted to impervious surfaces accounted for 11.68% of the total sand transfer area. In the Nasser Reservoir region, significant conversions occurred between water, grasslands, and sand. Sand converted to water made up 3.83% of the total sand transfer area, while grassland converted to water compriseed 5.38% of the total grassland transfer area. (3) The ecological benefits of the northern region of Egypt and the Nasser Reservoir have increased significantly. In northern region of Egypt, the primary drivers of this increase in ecological service value are the conversion of arable land and grasslands, along with the ecological development and utilization of sand. In the Nasser Reservoir area,the inflow of water and the continued outflow of sands are the main factors contributing to the rise in ecosystem service value. (4) Differentiated LUCC management should be implemented for different ecological functional zones. In northern region of Egypt, the focus should be on balancing ecological security with human development, while the Nasser Reservoir area should prioritize water resource protection and sustainable development.

Currently, this area has been losing its resilience and is becoming unable to sustain its inhabitants. Based on both RS-derived and GIS-computed land-use/cover changes (LUCC) as well as socioeconomic validations, this article explored the LUCC and agroecological-based driver patterns in Gedeo-Abaya landscape from 1986 to 2015. A combination of geo-spatial technology and cross-sectional survey design were employed to detect the drivers behind these changes. The article discussed that LUCC and the prevalence of drivers are highly diverse and vary throughout agroecological zones. Except for the population, most downstream top drivers are perceived as insignificant in the upstream region and vice versa. In the downstream, land-use/cover (LUC) classes are more dynamic, diverse, and challenged by nearly all anticipated drivers than are upstream ones. Agroforestry LUC has been increasing (by 25% of its initial cover) and is becoming the predominant cover type, although socioeconomic analysis and related findings show its rapid LUC modification.

We report here the effects of some common LULC types on run-off generation in North East India. LULC were found to be closely related to soil macroporosity and the resulting infiltration and surface run-off generation capacities under varying high-intensity rainfall events. The MACRO 5.0 model was used to simulate water transport through soils in both macropore and micropore domains. The model simulations revealed that LULC significantly influenced the moisture content and water flow rate in both the domains. Undisturbed forest soils, having a high degree of macroporosity, showed higher preferential flow and low run-off. However, paddy fields exhibited very high surface run-off due to lower infiltration owing to hard pan formation at a shallow depth. Soils under jhum cultivation showed significant number of active macropores in the upper soil layer, whereas the macropore connectivity was apparently lost in the lower horizons. Less infiltration of rainwater was observed in the grasslands, where the surface-initiated macropores were blocked by eroded, fine soil particles. Under extreme storm events, rainfall characteristics primarily controlled the run-off generation processes as the intake capacity of the soil macropores was exceeded.",Land use and land cover,run-off generation,infiltration,extreme storm events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Availability of these data can contribute to new approaches to the assessment of the European landscape, for instance in the context of environmental and economic accounting, diversity, modelling of its properties, etc. These possibilities are given by the fact that land cover reflects the biophysical state of the real landscape. The paper contains information about frequency and areas of CLC and their changes in the period 1990-2000, but above all in the processes - flows (LCF) that take place in the European landscape. Results of statistical analysis and maps demonstrate the frequency and rate (by two values: one above and another below the mean LCF rates) of the following processes: urbanisation (LCF1), intensification of agriculture (LCF2), extensification of agriculture (LCF3), afforestation (LCF4), deforestation (LCF5) and construction of water bodies (LCF6). LCF1 was most conspicuous in the Netherlands (2.1% of total country's area), LCF2 in Ireland (3.3%), LCF3 in the Czech Republic (over 3.5%), LCF4 in Portugal (over 4%), LCF5 in Portugal (over 3.5%) and LCF6 in the Netherlands and Slovakia (over 0.1%). The overall area of identified land cover changes in 24 European Countries in the period 1990-2000 was around 88,000 km(2) which equals 2.5% of their total area.

We used annual and seasonal spectral-temporal metrics and environmental features to map 12 land cover and land use classes across Europe. The spectral-temporal metrics provided an efficient means to capture seasonal variations of land surface spectra and to reduce the impact of clouds and cloud-shadows by relaxing the otherwise strong cloud cover limitations imposed by image-based classification methods. The best classification model was based on Landsat-8 data from three years (2014-2016) and achieved an accuracy of 75.1%, nearly 2 percentage points higher than the classification model based on a single year of Landsat data (2015). Our results indicate that annual pan-European land cover maps are feasible, but that temporally dynamic classes like artificial land, cropland, and grassland still benefit from more frequent satellite observations. The produced pan-European land cover map compared favorably to the existing CORINE (Coordination of Information on the Environment) 2012 land cover dataset. The mapped country-wide area proportions strongly correlated with LUCAS-estimated area proportions (r = 0.98). Differences between mapped and LUCAS sample-based area estimates were highest for broadleaved forest (map area was 9% higher). Grassland and seasonal cropland areas were 7% higher than the LUCAS estimate, respectively. In comparison, the correlation between LUCAS and CORINE area proportions was weaker (r = 0.84) and varied strongly by country.

However, a significant decline was observed in agricultural (61.64%), hill vegetation (43.26%), mangrove forest (30.7%), fallow (22.02%), and Tree Outside of Forest (TOF) land (8.81%). The LULC changes between 2020 and 2035 were predicted using the cellular automata-artificial neural network (CA-ANN) model. The prediction maps from 2020-2035 illustrated increasing trends of built-up land (+ 15.65%) and decreasing trends of all other LULC types, predominantly, agricultural (-3.53%), fallow (-3.13%), trees outside of forest (-6.53%), and pond/lake (-1.44%).

This paper presents a multidisciplinary approach used to assess historical land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes and their impacts on the environment in southeast Mato Grosso State, a region where the Cerrado has been intensively converted into agricultural lands. The methodology encompassed three main stages: (1) quantifying LULC changes using remote sensing data, (2) assessing LULC change impacts on vulnerable lands (e.g. erosion prone areas and wetlands), and (3) summarizing preceding information into key environmental indicators, assessed within the Pressure-State-Response framework (PSR) of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The results indicated a drastic landscape transformation in the selected area, which evolved from predominantly vegetated to a consolidated agricultural region. Crops expanded at high rates from 1985 to 1995, occupying the majority of the lands suited for agriculture. In the following decade, crops continued to expand and encroached into fragile environments (e.g. wetlands and more erodible soils). As a result, from 1985 to 2005, the area lost approximately 42% of its natural vegetation and erosion risks increased significantly. Our integration of land-use change information with intrinsic environmental vulnerabilities allowed a deeper understanding of LULC changes consequences and provided environmental indicators. This offered a synoptic view of how LULC changes occurred and how they affected the environment at a landscape scale. Furthermore, the assessment of the indicators using the PSR framework, helped to clarify cause-effect relationships thus furnishing key information of value to decision-makers and future comparisons with other areas.

To date, however, there has been no comprehensive assessment of regional land cover change, and most long-term trends have not yet been quantified. Using a designed sample of satellite-based observations of historical land cover change, we estimate the areas and trends in nine land cover classes from 1998 to 2017 in Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Zambia. Our analysis found an 18,154,000 (+/- 1,580,000) ha, or 34.8%, increase in the area of cropland in East Africa. Conversion occurred primarily from Open Grasslands, Wooded Grasslands, and Open Forests, causing a large-scale reduction in woody vegetation classes. We observed far more conversion (by approximately 20 million hectares) of woody classes to less-woody classes than succession in the direction of increasing trees and shrubs. Spatial patterns within our sample highlight regional land cover conversion hotspots, such as the Central Zambezian Miombo Woodlands, as potential areas of concern related to the conservation of natural ecosystems.

In a semiarid environment, such as the U.S. Great Plains, droughts can have a large influence on the productivity of agriculture and grasslands, with serious environmental and economic impacts. Here, we used the vegetation drought response index (VegDRI) drought indicator to investigate the response of vegetation to weather and climate for land-cover types in the Great Plains in the United States from 1989 to 2012. We found that analysis that focused on land-cover types within ecoregion divisions provided substantially more and land-cover-based detail on the timing and intensity of drought than did summarizing across the entire Great Plains region. In the northern Great Plains, VegDRI measured more frequent drought impacts on vegetation in the western ecoregions than in the eastern ecoregions. Across the ecoregions of the Great Plains, drought impacts on vegetation were more commonly found in grassland than in cropland. For example, in the ""Northwestern Great Plains"" ecoregion (which encompasses areas of Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska), grassland and nonirrigated cropland were observed in VegDRI to have historical fractional drought coverages in the growing season of 17% and 11%, respectively.",Land surface,Drought,Vegetation,Remote sensing,Atmosphere-land interaction,Vegetation-atmosphere interactions,,"Mahmood, Rezaul","Bliss, Norman",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the Biosphere Reserve (BR) has undergone significant changes and efforts since it was registered by UNESCO in 2010 as a high biodiversity area of international importance, there is still a lack of information about the anticipated changes in LULC in the future. The primary aim of the study is to simulate the potential changes in LULC in the YCFBR area for the upcoming three decades. In this study, we utilized Landsat satellite imagery taken in 1992, 2007, and 2022 for analysis. The findings suggest that the agricultural area is expected to grow from 20.3% in 2022 to 24% in 2052, while the proportion of open forest is predicted to rise from 13.4% in 2022 to 18% in 2052. In addition, there is an anticipated decrease in both high forest and grazing lands. High forest is expected to decline from 50.1% in 2022 to 40% in 2052, while grazing lands are projected to decrease from 8.3% in 2022 to 6% in 2052.

It has many negative implications that lead to deforestation, poor agricultural practices, loss of soil fertility, and siltation that hinder socio-economic development. In view of this, the present study was conducted with the aim of estimating soil loss in relation to long-term land use/land cover change (LULC) in the Dehar watershed, Himachal Himalaya, North India. The study was carried out using Landsat and Sentinel imageries for the years 1999, 2010, and 2020. A GIS-based Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model was applied to assess the potential soil risk. The parameters used as input for computing the spatiotemporal changes of soil loss were rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, topographic, crop management, and conservation support practice factors. The results showed a mean soil loss of 63.71, 60.99, and 66.71 t/ha/yr for the years 1999, 2010, and 2020, respectively. In the LULC class defined as Built-up Land, the mean soil loss decreased from 32.19 t/ha/yr in 1999 to 18.77 t/ha/yr in 2010, and in the year 2020 the mean soil loss slightly increased to 20.15 t/ha/yr. Moreover, the LULC class Barren Land registered a decrease in mean soil loss for the years 1999, 2010, and 2020 of 86.43, 74.60, and 73.19 t/ha/yr, respectively.

Catchment-wide analysis reveals a six-fold expansion of settlement areas, a decline of arable land by 69% and a shrinking of the formerly glaciated areas by 73% until 2016. In the Alpine fluvial corridors, i.e. flood-prone areas at the valley floors and valley sides at ca. 300-year floods, settlements even expanded 7.5-fold, severely increasing the potential for flood damages. At the same time, the overall channel area of running waters has been reduced by 40% and 95% the formerly large wetlands have been lost. Overall, the fluvial corridors were truncated by 203 km(2) or 14%, thereby reducing flood retention capacity. The concentration of intensive forms of human land uses at lower altitudes, coupled with an upward shift of less intensively used, near-natural forms of land cover, has led to a both spatial and vertical separation of Alpine landscape features over the long term.

However, little research has acknowledged the compositional nature of these data. The goal of the present study is to explore, for the first time, the independent effect of eight LULC categories (agricultural land, bare land, coniferous forest, broad-leaved forest, sclerophyll forest, grassland and shrubs, urban areas, and waterbodies) on three selected common health conditions: type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), asthma and anxiety, using a compositional methodological approach and leveraging observational health data of Catalonia (Spain) at area level. We fixed the risk exposure scenario using three covariates (socioeconomic status, age group, and sex). Then, we assessed the independent effect of the eight LULC categories on each health condition. Our results show that each LULC category has a distinctive effect on the three health conditions and that the three covariates clearly modify this effect. This compositional approach has yielded plausible results supported by the existing literature, highlighting the relevance of environmental heterogeneity in health studies. In this sense, we argue that different types of envi-ronment possess exclusive biotic and abiotic elements affecting distinctively on human health. We believe our contribution might help researchers approach the environment in a more multidimensional man-ner integrating environmental heterogeneity in the analysis. (c) 2021 The Authors.

The results indicate that the national total losses in NPP attributed to urbanization reached 1.695 TgC between the late 1980s and 2015. A large proportion (63.02%) of the total losses was due to the transformation from cropland to urban land. Urban expansion decreased the monthly and total NPPs over southern China, which includes the South China Region, Southwest China Region, and the middle and lower regions of the Yangtze River. However, the total NPP increased in the majority of urbanized areas in Northern China, including the Huang-Huai-Hai Region, Inner Mongolia Region (MGR), Gan-Xin Region (GXR), and Northeast China Region; monthly NPP in GXR and MGR increased throughout the year. By contrast, the conversion to grassland or forestland increased the monthly and total NPPs of Northern China, suggesting that returning to forestland and grassland could increase the carbon sequestration capacity of terrestrial ecosystems in mainland China. Among the sub-regions, the Loess Plateau Region contributed the largest increase in NPP, which was prompted by the conversion to grassland and forestland. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Environmental variables were measured at 3 spatial scales: reach, local, and whole watershed. Macroinvertebrate distributions were related to environmental variables using canonical correspondence analysis to determine which variables and spatial scales best explained the observed community composition and to identify biota-land cover optima. The calculation of a biota-land cover optimum was a 2-step process. First, an individual taxon's optimum was estimated for a particular land cover by weighting the mean value for that land cover by the abundance of that taxon at all sites. Second, the biota-land cover optimum was determined as the point at which the greatest numbers of taxa, at their calculated optima, appeared for a particular land cover. Sampling reaches were located on streams in watersheds with varying levels of forest, agriculture, and urban/suburban land cover that represented the full range of physical conditions typically found in Puget Sound streams. At the reach scale, taxa composition was correlated with conductivity and mean velocity. At the local and whole-watershed scales, taxa composition was correlated with % forest and agricultural land cover and % forest and bedrock land cover, respectively. For all of the scales, the dominant environmental variables represented an anthropogenic gradient. There was little difference in the amount of variability explained by each spatial scale. At the local-watershed scale, a biota-land cover optimum of similar to80 to 90% forest land cover was identified. The total number of taxa at their optima declined rapidly as forest land cover within the local scale declined below 80 to 90%. At the whole-watershed scale, a biota-land cover optimum of 70 to 80% forest land cover was identified. The total number of taxa at their optima declined rapidly as forest land cover within the whole watershed declined below 70 to 80%. Our results suggest that macroinvertebrates can be used both as quantitative indicators of environmental conditions at multiple scales and indicators of land cover optima. Further examination of these optima could be used to establish priorities for conservation and restoration efforts.",macroinvertebrates,environmental gradients,land use,biological monitoring,environmental scale,land cover optima,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, for the first time, a highly novel Joint Deep Learning framework is proposed and demonstrated for LC and LU classification. The proposed Joint Deep Learning (JDL) model incorporates a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN), and is implemented via a Markov process involving iterative updating. In the JDL, LU classification conducted by the CNN is made conditional upon the LC probabilities predicted by the MLP. In turn, those LU probabilities together with the original imagery are re-used as inputs to the MLP to strengthen the spatial and spectral feature representations. This process of updating the MLP and CNN forms a joint distribution, where both LC and LU are classified simultaneously through iteration. The proposed JDL method provides a general framework within which the pixel-based MLP and the patch-based CNN provide mutually complementary information to each other, such that both are refined in the classification process through iteration. Given the well-known complexities associated with the classification of very fine spatial resolution (VFSR) imagery, the effectiveness of the proposed JDL was tested on aerial photography of two large urban and suburban areas in Great Britain (Southampton and Manchester). The JDL consistently demonstrated greatly increased accuracies with increasing iteration, not only for the LU classification, but for both the LC and LU classifications, achieving by far the greatest accuracies for each at around 10 iterations. The average overall classification accuracies were 90.18% for LC and 87.92% for LU for the two study sites, far higher than the initial accuracies and consistently outperforming benchmark comparators (three each for LC and LU classification). This research, thus, represents the first attempt to unify the remote sensing classification of LC (state; what is there?) and LU (function; what is going on there?), where previously each had been considered separately only. It, thus, has the potential to transform the way that LC and LU classification is undertaken in future. Moreover, it paves the way to address effectively the complex tasks of classifying LC and LU from VFSR remotely sensed imagery via joint reinforcement, and in an automatic manner.",Multilayer perceptron,Convolutional neural network,Land cover and land use classification,VFSR remotely sensed imagery,Object-based CNN,,,"Li, Huapeng","Gardiner, Andy","Hare, Jonathon","Atkinson, Peter M.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A well -used and effective paradigm for LUCC is the ANN -CA model which employs an artificial neural network (ANN) to calculate a transition probability over each land cell from various driving factors, and then uses a cellular automaton (CA) to evolve all cells consecutively to update their land usage and coverage according to the estimated probability distribution. This paper focuses on the effect of delays or perturbations possibly taking place between land cells on the LUCC modeling. To this end, a new ANN -CA model is proposed which adopts an asynchronous communicating cellular automaton (ACCA), rather than the conventional synchronous CA. Especially, the ACCA allows every cell to communicate with its neighbors independently at random times via a specific protocol, which offers a natural way to include stochastic delays in exchanging the current land usages between cells. As a result, every change of a cell's land use in the ACCA may not affect its neighbors immediately, but is subject to delays that might play an important role in modeling the practical LUCC. Numerical analysis of the new model are carried out over three regions of Chongqing city, China with different scales: Yongchuan District, Sanjiao Town, and Huangguashan Village, and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ANNACCA model can achieve a higher accuracy for LUCC simulation as compared to conventional ANN -CA models.",Land use change,Cellular automaton,Asynchronous communication,Simulation,,,,"Zhong, Jiang",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It focuses on the most recent changes in land surface temperature between 1991 and 2021 in the Chalisgaon Taluka of Maharashtra State, India. The results demonstrate that LULC changes have a significant impact on the climate through a range of mechanisms. There appears to be a connection between the changes in LULC spatial pattern with change in LST and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The error matrix is calculated for the assessment of the accuracy of classified land use land cover images. This analysis confirms that the most substantial alterations are related to changes in plant cover, as reflected by the alterations in LULC classes as well as in NDVI. The Built-up area covered 0.91% in 1991, but grew to 6.48% in 2021 compared to 1991. Between 1991 and 2021, the study region's vegetation and agricultural land area declined by 2.64%. It was discovered that there has been a quick transition from vegetation to built-up area. The mean LST ranges were amplified dramatically from 35.05 0 C to 46.22 0 C from 1991 to 2021, largely due to the growing build-up zone and decrease vegetation The study found that the growth of urban landscapes and associated rise in human activities, as well as shifting of agricultural patterns, LULC related changes to surface temperature, and regional climate feedback across this region, warrants further research.

Methods included development of a time series of land cover maps based on LANDSAT imagery from 1976, 1988, 1991, 1997 and 2000, as well as interviews and participant observation with local farmers and community leaders.Results indicate a high degree of forest conservation on community lands with net rates of forest loss of 0.6-0.7%/year. Locally recognized conservation regulations included a number of forest reserves as well as regulations which protect specific forest types, resulting from both local initiatives and interventions of external agencies. These initiatives included but were not limited to the PPF, highlighting the importance of evaluating community-based conservation programs within a broader historical context. Conservation regulations protecting an important commercial non-timber forest product (Manilkara zapota) pre-dated the PPF and may have facilitated its implementation. In the most accessible agricultural areas, the only mature forest patches were customary forest reserves and an area regenerated from secondary forests, protected due to enrichment plantings of commercial timbers. Recognition of local Maya terminology used to distinguish forest types was crucial for proper interpretation of local land-use regulations, which revealed that less-valued forest types may not be adequately protected on community lands.We suggest that future research should examine the significance of the less-valued forest types for global biodiversity conservation. In addition careful consideration of the historical antecedents and community institutions which may have facilitated the implementation of the Plan Piloto Forestal will be important for the successful application of this model of community forestry to other socio-economic and cultural contexts.

The temporal data were based on Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images acquired in June of 1984, 2002, 2007, 2009, and 2011. The NDVI was applied to all the Landsat images, and the resulting NDVI images were overlaid to generate an NDVI layer stack image. The same procedure was repeated using the SAVI and BUAI images. The layer stack images revealed those areas that had changed in terms of the different indices over the years. To determine temporal change trends, the values of 150 randomly selected control points were extracted from the same locations in the NDVI, SAVI, and BUAI layer stack images.

The reasons for this are not immediately clear given that unlike other European regions with similar population density values, for example in Northern Scandinavia, they are not exposed to extreme climatic conditions, nor are they located in isolated mountain regions. Using the CORINE Land Cover database, we observed that in both provinces, there has been an expansion in shrub and forest land uses and a decline in agriculture due largely to the fact that certain areas have been abandoned by their inhabitants, although in other parts of these provinces, the amount of land used for agriculture has increased.

Moreover, we designed six scenarios to explore the impacts of climate and land use/land cover (LULC) changes on regional water yield and quantitatively determined the dominant mechanisms of water yield services. The results are expected to provide an important theoretical reference for future spatial planning and improvements of ecological service functions at the water source site. We found that (1) under the time series analysis, the water yield changes of the Dongjiang Lake Basin showed an initial decrease followed by an increase. Spatially, water yield also decreased from the lake area to the surrounding region. (2) Climate change exerted a more significant impact on water yield changes, contributing more than 98.26% to the water yield variability in the basin. In contrast, LULC had a much smaller influence, contributing only 1.74 %. (3) The spatial distribution pattern of water yield services in the watershed was more vulnerable to LULC changes.

The results of the digital classification were complimented with field-based observations on major observable characteristics of every LU/LC identified. Thirteen classes (forest area, dense grassland, grassy fallow, grazed open grassland, open cultivation, open grain fallow farmland, pepper cultivation, rice farmland, scrubland, sugarcane farmland, dry bare land, sand deposit and wetland/water) were characterized and the nature and extent of their changes assessed. 40 % of the basin's uses is under cultivation, 22 % is under fallow, 27 % is either degraded or non-cultivable, while 11 % is forested. Change events include forest loss, increase in area cultivated, expansion of shrub/scrubland and pervasiveness of grazing. The changes were more pronounced in the upper than either the central and southern segments of the basin. In general LU/LC changes in the basin are reflection of increased human population pressure and effects of climate change. The LU/LC patterns and changes suggest underutilization and mismanagement of the floodplain which have impact on soil, hydrology and biodiversity with serious implication for livelihood and food security.

This paper proposes a novel feature-level fusion framework, in which the Landsat operational land imager (OLI) images with different cloud covers, and a fully polarized Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) image are selected to conduct LULC classification experiments. We take the karst mountain in Chongqing as a study area, following which the features of the spectrum, texture, and space of the optical and SAR images are extracted, respectively, supplemented by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), elevation, slope and other relevant information. Furthermore, the fused feature image is subjected to object-oriented multi-scale segmentation, subsequently, an improved support vector machine (SVM) model is used to conduct the experiment. The results showed that the proposed framework has the advantages of multi-source data feature fusion, high classification performance and can be applied in mountain areas.

The supervised classification results were further improved by employing image enhancement and visual interpretation. Ratio Vegetation Index with fuzzy-based possibilistic c-means classification approach has improved the classification accuracy of the shifting cultivated area. Post-classification comparisons of the classified images indicated that the major change consisted of barren land and forestland changing into agricultural land and scrubland.

A notable transformation involves the modification of land surface temperature (LST), which is impacted by changes in Land Use-Land Cover (LULC). The most important approach in discovering changes is to increase the accuracy of classification methods. Deep learning techniques have been successfully used, and this improved performance has been carried over to image classification. This study aims to monitor and mapping the spatial and temporal changes of LULC and LST in Izeh city using remote sensing, GIS, and deep learning. LULC and LST maps for the years 2001 and 2021 were created by processing thermal and multispectral bands. Two methods were used to generate the land use-land cover map: pixel-based (Max Likelihood (ML)) and object-based (Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)). During this period, the percentages of changes in water, urban, and wasteland classes increased, whereas those for grassland, forest, and wetland classes decreased. The average LST changes followed this order: wasteland > urban > grassland > forest > wetland > water. The normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), normalized differential water index (NDWI), and normalized differential build-up index (NDBI) were utilized to analyze the relationship between LST and LULC. A linear, positive relationship between LST and NDBI was observed, indicating the direct effect of urban development on the increase in LST in the study area. The overall accuracy for LULC maps using the ML method was over 80.74% in 2001 and over 90.76% in 2021. With the FCN method, the accuracy was over 93% in 2001 and over 98% in 2021.

Classification accuracies were based upon ground truth data obtained by global positioning system field collection and photo interpretations. A postclassification change detection analysis was used to identify areas that have experienced conversions in land use or land cover. Comparisons of the land cover maps reveal that a steady growth in population and an increase in commercial and residential development have caused extensive changes to critical habitats throughout the basin. The maps also indicate that the loss of coastal wetlands, combined with shoreline erosion, remains one of the most serious environmental problems facing the Pontchartrain Basin today. The postclassification change detection analysis showed that critical habitats accounted for nearly 40% of the total urban growth between 1982 and 2005.

Most existing spatially explicit LCMs represent land use or cover using either pixel or polygon/patch spatial units. However, the effects of the choice to use pixel versus polygonal land units on the outputs from any given model have not yet been systematically assessed. We evaluated the impacts of alternative land units on the performance of a LCM. A stochastic LCM based on a geostatistical algorithm was developed and applied using both pixel and polygons, which were derived from parcel maps. Nine possible parcel-change scenarios were generated to evaluate the effects of geometric change in management boundaries. The approach was tested through the simulation of multiple land-cover transitions in Medina County, Ohio, between 1992 and 2011. Performance of the simulations was assessed using a metric for the accuracy of spatial allocations (figure of merit (FoM)) and several landscape pattern metrics describing the shapes and sizes of resulting land-cover patches. Results support the notion that there is a clear trade-off between pixel and polygon land units: using polygon boundaries is helpful in obtaining more realistic spatial patterns, but at the cost of location accuracy. Significant differences were found among different parcel-change scenarios on both location accuracy and spatial patterns, with the primary effects being dependent on the type of land-cover transition and the resolution at which validation was assessed.",Land-cover change,spatial modelling,GIS,tessellation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, existing UAV-based image scene classification techniques face limitations, particularly in handling dynamic scenes, varying environmental conditions, and accurately identifying small or partially obscured objects. These challenges necessitate more advanced and robust methods for land cover classification. In response, this study explores ensemble learning (EL) as a powerful alternative to traditional machine learning approaches. By integrating predictions from multiple models, EL enhances accuracy, precision, and robustness in UAV-based land use and land cover classification. This research introduces a two-phase approach combining data preprocessing with feature extraction using three advanced ensemble models DenseNet201, EfficientNetV2S, and Xception employing transfer learning.

Comparative analysis reveals a 4.2 % accuracy improvement with the ensembled models and a 1 % boost with the advanced hybrid models. This work significantly advances UAV image scene classification, offering a practical solution to enhance decision-making precision in various applications.

They provide the necessary data for effectively planning and managing natural land resources. In this study, we analyzed and simulated the changes in urban LULC within Zhejiang Province, a region in China experiencing rapid urbanization. By exploring the historical change dynamics of the region, we observed substantial transformations in the extent of built-up areas, forests, and agricultural land from 1995 to 2020. Specifically, the study area witnessed the expansion in urban built-up areas by approximately 6126.93 km(2), while forests and agricultural land witnessed decreases of 3252.47 km(2) and 2885.13 km(2), respectively. To predict the study area's future LULC, a cellular automata (CA) model was utilized in combination with an advanced patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model. This integrated approach allowed for multiple land use predictions based on different scenarios. Under the baseline scenario (BLS), it was projected that the area of urban expansion in Zhejiang Province would be approximately 4501.62 km(2). However, under the scenario of cultivated land and ecological protection, i.e., CLPS and EPS, urban growth was observed to be 538.64 km(2) and 1776.16 km(2), respectively. These findings indicate that the extent of built-up area development in Zhejiang Province is significantly reduced when the CLPS and EPS are implemented in comparison to the BLS.

However, CNNs encounter challenges when applied to Landsat images with limited multi-spectral bands, as they struggle to learn stable features from the spectral domain and integrate them with spatial features to enhance accuracy. Additionally, most CNN applications focus on learning features directly from the raw image, making them susceptible to spectral environment changes. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel approach for large-scale Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) extraction from Landsat OLI images. The proposed classification architecture comprises two modules. The first module utilizes a feature relationships matrix to generate an extent feature map (EFM), and a specifically designed CNN structure learns deep features from the EFM and spatial domain. In the second module, a multiple classifiers system (MCS) is employed to obtain shallow learning features, which are further enhanced by another CNN structure through continued learning. The combined features from these modules contribute to improved classification of remote sensing images. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method effectively acquires stable features for training deep learning models with strong generalization ability.

Therefore in this study, we developed a semi-automated object-based land use/land cover classification to identify and quantify LULC changes and change detection analysis in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq for the period 1990 to 2020 using Landsat satellite data (TM, ETM+, and OLI). To determine the optimum segmentation scales for each phase, we first applied and evaluated different scales of a multi-resolution segmentation technique. After that, spatial (digital elevation information) and spectral information were combined in an object-based image analysis (OBIA) technique. For each LULC class, object features were found. We then used the standard nearest neighbor (SNN) approach to derive their individual properties. Field data and validation units collected from high resolution Google earth pro and historical maps in SAS planet open source were used to conduct accuracy evaluations based on the error matrix and kappa coefficient for each reference year. With overall accuracies ranging from 86.072% to 88.9% and Kappa coefficients of 0.845-0.878, ten LULCs were effectively recorded. After that, a post classification comparison was used to perform a change analysis. The findings demonstrated that LULC change trends were notably different, as all categories were altered at different times throughout the study. Strikingly, 52.1% of the land use/land cover in the Kurdistan Region has changed between 1990 and 2020. All changes corresponded to the KRI's own challenges throughout the last three decades. The OBIA-based approaches and features, we conclude, have a lot of potential for LULC mapping and monitoring.

In particular, publicly available data from the European Space Agency's Sentinel missions have been used in various remote sensing applications. However, there is a lack of studies that utilize these data to assess the performance of machine learning algorithms in complex boreal landscapes. In this article, I compare the classification performance of four non-parametric algorithms: support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), extreme gradient boosting (Xgboost), and deep learning (DL). The study area chosen is a complex mixed-use landscape in south-central Sweden with eight land-cover and land-use (LCLU) classes. The satellite imagery used for the classification were multi-temporal scenes from Sentinel-2 covering spring, summer, autumn and winter conditions. Using stratified random sampling, each LCLU class was allocated 1477 samples, which were divided into training (70%) and evaluation (30%) subsets. Accuracy was assessed through metrics derived from an error matrix, but primarily overall accuracy was used in allocating algorithm hierarchy. A two-proportion Z-test was used to compare the proportions of correctly classified pixels of the algorithms and a McNemar's chi-square test was used to compare class-wise predictions. The results show that the highest overall accuracy was produced by support vector machines (0.758 +/- 0.017), closely followed by extreme gradient boosting (0.751 +/- 0.017), random forests (0.739 +/- 0.018), and finally deep learning (0.733 +/- 0.0023). The Z-test comparison of classifiers showed that a third of algorithm pairings were statistically different. On a class-wise basis, McNemar's test results showed that 62% of class-wise predictions were significant from one another at the 5% level or less. Variable importance metrics show that nearly half of the top twenty Sentinel-2 bands belonged to the red edge (25%) and shortwave infrared (23%) portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and were dominated by scenes from spring (38%) and summer (40%). The results are discussed within the scope of recent studies involving machine learning and Sentinel-2 data and key knowledge gaps identified.

The area frame survey uses a systematic sampling technique with 0.9 km2 sample plots at 18 km intervals. A complete wall-to-wall land cover map of an entire plot surveyed is obtained in situ by a team of fieldworkers equipped with aerial photographs. The use of sample plots with extended coverage (0.9 km2) ensures that the survey also deals with local variation, thus strengthening the estimates well beyond simple point sampling. The article documents the methodology used in the survey, followed by a discussion of issues raised by the choice of methodology.

This study presents the contributing factors of LU and LC and the extent and effects of these changes on sustainable LU in the Diyala River drainage area, north of Iraq. Five major LU and LC types (cultivated and settled land, bare land, water bodies, and palm) from Landsat images of 2013, 2016, 2019, and 2022 were mapped. The images were classified using a classification algorithm and a maximum likelihood classifier. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), vegetation condition index (VCI), and land surface temperature (LST) maps are derived using multi-temporal Landsat 8 and 9 OLI/TIRS satellites. In the past decade, the buildup and barren lands have expanded from 1295.8 km(2) (3.9%) to 1677.4 km(2) (5.1%) and 5770.3 km(2) (17.5%) to 8501.1 km(2) (25.8%), whereas the vegetation cover has declined from 25,273.9 km(2) (76.6%) to 22,421.8 km(2) (68.0%). NDVI saw a significant rise in 2019 and 2022. There were maximum changes in NDVI in the northeast and southeast, where rainfall was higher than before in some parts. The VCI results showed that in 2022, there was a larger class area, with a prolonged extreme drought extent of 5727.1 km(2) (47.8%). The findings imply that NDVI and LST are more closely correlated drought indices and are appropriate for use in arid and semi-arid areas to monitor drought with limited data. These studies will advance our knowledge of the connections between drought indices from remote sensing and meteorology.

Thus, the creation of LULCM using OSM requires a solution for handling these inconsistencies.

However, we still lack interdisciplinary methods to project future LULC scenarios at spatial scales that are relevant for local decision making and future environmental assessments. Here we apply an interdisciplinary approach to develop spatially explicit projections of LULC at a resolution of 30 x 30 m informed by historic relationships between LULC and their key drivers, within the context of the four qualitative scenarios of global shared socioeconomic pathways. We apply this methodology to a case study in the Zona da Mata, Brazil, which has a history of major LULC changes. The analysis of LULC changes from 1986 to 2015 indicates that pasture area decreased from 76 to 58 % of total area, while forest areas increased from 18 to 24 %, and coffee from 3 to 11 %. Environmental protection legislation, rural credit for smallholder farmers, and demand for agricultural and raw products were identified as main drivers of LULC changes. Projected LULC for 2045 strongly depends on the global socioeconomic pathway scenarios, and forest and coffee areas may increase substantially under strong government measures in the environmentally conscious Green Road scenario or decrease in the high consumption Rocky Road scenario. Our study shows that under the set of drivers during the past three decades reforestation can go hand in hand with increase of agricultural production, but that major and contrasting changes in LULC can be expected depending on the socioeconomic pathway that will be followed in the future. To guide this process, LULC scenarios at the local scale can inform the planning of local and regional development and forest conservation.",Land use,Public policies,Future scenarios,Interdisciplinarity,Forest transition,,,"Schulte, R.

By comparing the satellite observations from Landsat MSS (1972-73) and IRS-P6 AWiFS (2006-07) considerable LULC changes are observed, an increase in crop-land and vegetated areas of similar to 57% in the eastern and similar to 68% in the western Rajasthan. The increase in agriculture intensification from irrigation activities after the construction of the Indira Gandhi canal (IGC) seems to affect the land-atmosphere fluxes, i.e. increase in atmospheric humidity and latent heat and reduction in sensible heat. On the other hand, the multi-decadal variability (1951-2007) in annual rainfall amount and total number of rainy days reveals significant year-to-year fluctuations, exhibiting a slight increasing trend over arid western Rajasthan. However, the overall analysis shows that the variability in precipitation is much more influenced by the general monsoonal circulation (i.e. meteorological dynamics and intensity of the monsoon) and partly can be associated with local phenomena, such as LULC changes and modifications in land-atmosphere fluxes. Similarly to precipitation, the long-term (1979-2008) aerosol index (AI) variations over the region seem to be affected by atmospheric and meteorological dynamics and not by LULC changes.

Advancements in satellite sensor technology have led to improvements in spatial resolution and wider coverage areas. Nevertheless, the lack of high-resolution labelled data is still a challenge, hindering the large-scale application of land cover classification methods. In this study, a Transformer-based weakly supervised method for cross-resolution land cover classification using outdated data is proposed. First, to capture long-range dependencies without overlooking the fine-grained details of objects, a U-Net-like Transformer based on a reverse difference mechanism (RDM) using dynamic sparse attention is designed. Second, an anti-noise loss calculation module based on optimal transport (OT) is proposed. The anti-noise loss calculation identifies confident areas and vague areas based on the OT matrix, which relieves the effect of noises on outdated land cover products. By introducing a weakly supervised loss with weights and using an unsupervised loss, the RDM-based U-Net-like Transformer was trained. Remote sensing images with 1 m resolutions and the corresponding ground truths of six states in the United States were used to validate the performance of the proposed method. The experiments used outdated land cover products with 30 m resolutions from 2013 as training labels and produced land cover maps with 1 m resolutions from 2017.

In order to provide an empirical example, we selected south-eastern Italian Alps, manly Trentino-South Tyrol, as test region. We classified two Landsat images (1976 and 2001) in order to forecast probability of occurrence for tmsampled locations and to determine the best subset of predictors (spectral bands). A difference map for each land cover class, representing the difference between 1976 and 2001 probability of occurrence values, was built. In order to better address the patterns of change analysis, we put together difference maps and topographic variables. The latter are considered, at least in the study area, as the main environmental drivers of land-use change, in connection with climate change. Our results indicate that the selected algorithm, applied to land cover classes, can provide reliable data, especially when referring to classes with homogeneous texture properties and surface reflectance.

The analysis made it possible to verify that Forest Formation and Pastures were the classes that suffered the most changes, followed by the Annual and Perennial Culture and Mosaic of Agriculture and Pasture. The projected land use and coverage for 2044 suggests that there will be a reduction in Forest Formation due to a significant increase in the Pasture class.

The prevailing under-standing of the relation between Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) and armed conflict fails to fully recognize the complexity of their dynamics - a shortcoming that could undermine food security and sustainable land/water resources management in conflict settings. The Syrian portion of the transboundary Orontes River Basin (ORB) has been a site of violent conflict since 2013. Correspondingly, the Lebanese and Turkish portions of the ORB have seen large influxes of refugees. A major challenge in any geoscientific investigation in this region, specif-ically the Syrian portion, is the unavailability of directly-measured ""ground truth"" data. To circumvent this problem, we develop a novel methodology that combines remote sensing products, machine learning techniques and quasi-experimental statistical analysis to better understand LULC changes in the ORB between 2004 and 2022. Through analysis of the resulting annual LULC maps, we can draw several quantitative conclusions. Cropland areas decreased by 21-24 % in Syria's conflict hotspot zones after 2013, whereas a 3.4-fold increase was detected in Lebanon. The development of refugee settlements was also tracked in Lebanon and on the Syrian/Turkish borders, revealing different LULC patterns that depend on settlement dynamics. The results highlight the importance of understanding the heterogenous spatio-temporal LULC changes in conflict-affected and refugee-hosting countries. The developed methodology is a flexible, cloud-based approach that can be applied to wide variety of LULC investigations related to conflict, policy and climate.",Orontes River basin,Google earth engine,Syria,Land use,land cover change,Difference-in-differences,Croplands,"Asaad, Ahmed Haj","Brunner, Philip",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, two 10-year (2006-2015) regional climate simulations using current (2011) and future (2100) land-use/land-cover (LULC) patterns over the continental United States (CONUS) are used to assess the sensitivity of LLJ properties, including jet occurrence, maximum speed, and the elevation of the maximum, to changes in LULC. The three simulated LLJ properties exhibit greater sensitivity in summer than in winter. Summertime jets are projected to increase in frequency in the central CONUS, where cropland replaces grassland, and decrease in parts of the Ohio-River Valley and the Southeast, particularly Florida, where urban expansion occurs. Little change is projected for wintertime jet frequency. Larger modifications to jet speed and elevations are projected in parts of the Ohio River Valley, the upper Southeast, and the Intermountain West. While there is some evidence of weaker, more elevated jets with urban expansion, the connection between changes in jet speed and elevation and changes in LULC patterns at a given location is weak.

In the present study, the changes in LULC were analyzed by means of multi-temporal remote sensing of Qena-Luxor Governorates in Egypt between 1984 and 2018. In order to map and monitor the land use land cover changes, several remotely sensed data were applied to create multi-maps using (1) the normalized difference vegetation index and (2) supervised classification of Landsat images using field chick and accuracy assessment, including field verification and Google Earth Professional. Therefore, the lands in the study area can be classified as follows: (1) agricultural lands, (2) built-up areas, (3) water bodies, (4) reclaimed lands, and (5) desert lands. The results indicate that agricultural lands grew from an average of 1238.7 km(2)(9.8%) in 1984 to 1707.04 km(2)(13.40%) in 2018 and urban lands increased from 345.2 km(2)(2.7%) in 1984 to 445.28 km(2)(3.5%) in 2019. Furthermore, the reclaimed lands increased approximately from 4379.7 km(2)in 1984 (i.e., 34.4% of the total study area) to 4521.05 km(2)in 2000 (35.507%).

Hence, it is crucial to elucidate the interaction among hydrological processes to improve sustainable water management plans. The current study explored the effects of LULCC on hydrological processes in the Gala Lake catchment over a 30-year temporal period. In this context, to evaluate LULCC, land cover maps were obtained using the supervised classification method with Landsat images (5 TM, 7 ETM+, 8 OLI) of 1993, 2008, and 2023. Hydrological processes were assessed using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a commonly applied eco-hydrological model. The model was utilized to evaluate the potential effect of LULCC on processes like surface runoff, infiltration, evapotranspiration, and erosion. Between 1993 and 2023, significant LULCC have been observed in the study area. There has been a decrease of 4.3%, 1%, 1.6%, and 5.3% in agricultural lands, forested lands, inland marshes, and pasture lands, respectively, while artificial surfaces, rice fields, and water bodies have seen an increase of 7%, 3.4%, and 1.9%, respectively. The potential effects of these changes were observed as a decrease in the runoff, a decrease in permeability, and an increase in processes such as evapotranspiration and erosion throughout the basin and sub-basin. In general, LULCC significantly affect the hydrological status of the catchment. Therefore, establishing different conservation and utilization strategies that consider land use dynamics to maintain the resilience of ecosystems in the basins is vital in the sustainable management of water resources.",Gala Lake,hydrological processes,land use land cover change,SWAT model,water resources management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, we evaluated intensity analysis at the category level for five time intervals, namely 1992-1997, 1997-2002, 2002-2007 and 2007-2012, 2012-2018.

After accuracy assessment, the global land-cover map for 2009 from the GlobCover data is selected, and a reclassified version of this map is used as a verification tool for comparison with the reclassified study data. The analysis of changes over the last 26 years shows that the loss for Cropland are dormant during the first and second time intervals, but active during the third, fourth, and fifth time intervals. By contrast, Forest experienced loss during all time intervals, and SGO experienced active loss only during the second time interval. Urban is the only category that experienced active gain during all time intervals. The present study also indicates that urbanization has and converted land in temperate regions during the past 26 years.

In this paper, we propose an uncertainty assessment schema to capture the semantic translation uncertainty between heterogeneous LUC CSs and evaluate the data label uncertainty of multitemporal LUC mapping results caused by uncertainty propagation. The semantic translation uncertainty between CSs is investigated using a dynamic semantic reference system (DSRS) model and semantic similarity analysis. An object-based unsupervised change detection algorithm is adopted to determine the probability of changes in land patches, and novel uncertainty metrics are proposed to estimate the patch label uncertainty in LUC maps. The proposed uncertainty assessment schema was validated via experiments on four LUC datasets, and the results confirmed that semantic uncertainty had great impact on data reliability and that the uncertainty metrics could be used in the development of uncertainty controls in multitemporal LUC mapping by referring to uncertainty assessment results.

The process of infiltration into saturated macroporous soils is primarily controlled by size, network, density, connectivity, saturation of surrounding soil matrix, and depthwise distribution of macropores. To understand the effects of local land use, land cover and management practices on soil macroporosity, colour dye infiltration experiments were conducted with ten soil columns (25 x 25 x 50 cm) collected from different watersheds of the region under similar soil and agro-climatic zones. The sampling sites included two undisturbed forested hillslopes, two conventionally cultivated paddy fields, two forest lands abandoned after Jhum cultivation, and two paddy fields, one pineapple plot and one banana plot presently under active cultivation stage of the Jhum cycle. Digital image analyses of the obtained dye patterns showed that the infiltration patterns differed significantly for different sites with varying land use, land cover, and cultivation practices. Undisturbed forest soils showed high degree of soil macroporosity throughout the soil profile, paddy fields revealed sealing of macropores at the topsoil due to hard pan formation, and Jhum cultivated plots showed disconnected subsoil macropores. The important parameters related to soil macropores such as maximum and average size of macropores, number of active macropores, and depthwise distribution of macropores were estimated to characterise the soil macroporosity for the sites. These experimentally derived quantitative data of soil macroporosity can have wide range of applications in the region such as water quality monitoring and groundwater pollution assessment due to preferential leaching of solutes and pesticides, study of soil structural properties and infiltration behaviour of soils, investigation of flash floods in rivers, and hydrological modelling of the watersheds.",Hillslope,land use and land cover,infiltration,macropores,dye pattern analysis,experiments,hydrology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,instruments and techniques,,,,,,,,,,,

Unprecedented extreme rainfall left the region with huge losses of infrastructure. Several studies reported the role of improper dam operations and climate change in this region. However, changing land use/land cover (LULC) is an important driver of flood modulation; we therefore studied regional LULC changes (over 4 decades) and their impacts on flooding during this event using the Weather Research Forecasting (WRF)-Hydro model. We downscaled the NCEP final operational global analysis data using WRF to provide meteorological inputs for the gridded WRF-Hydro model. WRF downscaled forcing, along with observed discharge, were used to calibrate WRF-Hydro, which was run with the meteorological forcing of the August 2018 floods using LULC corresponding to 1985, 1995, 2005, and 2018. Analysis of LULC change indicated a significant loss of evergreen forest and reductions in shrubland during 1995-2005 and considerable loss of mixed forest during 2005-2018. The most extensive changes in flooding attributes (discharge, inundation area, and flood surface height) were found for LULC changes from 1995 to 2005. Specifically, comparing 2005 to 1995, we found that high flows (estimated by Q(10)) increased by >10% at many stations (up to similar to 50% for several locations). The increase in surface water head was similar to 40% over some parts with increased inundation. During 2005-2018, afforestation measures reduced the steep decline in LC observed during 1995-2005. Thus, the contribution of LULC changes to the August 2018 flooding is mainly due to the deforestation-related changes during 1995-2005. This substantial role of LC in enhancing flood hazards highlights the need to better manage LC in watersheds.",Kerala Flood 2018,Weather Research Forecasting,WRF,WRF-Hydro,Flood modeling,Land use/land cover change,LULC change,"Choubey, Sweta",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Deforestation,,,,,,,,,,,

A training dataset of 13,419 points with a LULC label across three years from 2019 to 2021 was generated alongside a nationally representative test dataset of 834 points. These data were used to train a random forests model to convert an image stack of pre-processed Sentinel-2 surface reflectance data and topographic spatial layers into an annual categorical LULC map. When evaluated against the test dataset, the model has an overall accuracy of 83 % (SE: 2.1 %). The Fiji LULC map was compared to three global 10 m spatial resolution land cover products: Google's Dynamic World, ESRI LULC, and ESA's WorldCover v200. These maps were compared statistically using the independent test dataset and in several case study applications (e.g. agricultural monitoring and disaster impacts mapping). The Fiji LULC had a higher overall accuracy than the three global LULC products and aligned more closely with a high-quality field survey of over 2500 rice fields (i.e. Fiji LULC classified 88 % of the rice fields as agricultural compared to 60.6-15.7 % in the global LULC products). A comparison of the overlap between the agricultural class of the four LULC maps with a flood mask following Tropical Cyclone Yasa indicated that dataset choice has a substantial impact on estimates of the area of flooded croplands. The Fiji LULC map tends to capture agricultural land covers and smaller scale landscape features with more accuracy than the global products. This analysis illustrates the importance of assessing the performance of global LULC products in particular locations and for specific applications. As demonstrated here, the choice of LULC product could impact subsequent analysis and monitoring tasks. To support these LULC product comparisons, an open-source Python package for computing performance metrics for LULC maps when reference data have different strata to map classes has been published.

We asked study participants about LULC changes, the causes of each change, and the likely duration of its effects, and used this information to produce high-resolution maps of local perceptions of LULC change. Satellite image analysis revealed that above 6000 m there has been a decrease in the area covered by snow and ice and a consequent expansion of glacial lakes and areas covered by rock and soil. Between 3000 and 6000 m, forest and farmland are decreasing, and areas under grazing, settlement, and shrubland are increasing. Such LULC changes within the protected area clearly indicate the prevailing danger of land degradation. Results from the interviews and workshops suggest that people tended to detect LULC change that was acute and direct, but were less aware of slower changes that could be identified by satellite imagery analysis. Most study participants said that land use changes were a result of rapid economic development and the consequent pressure on natural resources, especially in the tourism industry and especially below 6000 m elevation, as well as limitations to protected area management and a period of civil war. Human influence coupled with climate change may explain the changes at higher elevations, whereas anthropogenic activities are solely responsible in lower areas.

This is typically done via hydrological modelling in combination with the onefactor-at-a-time analysis. However, it remains unclear howlarge the differences in isolated hydrological impacts would be when selecting different baseline periods. In this study, we compared baseline period choices for separating climate change and LUCC impacts on watershed hydrology in a typical inland river basin in northwest China, i. e. the Upper Heihe River Basin, with two hydrological models, i. e., Soil and Water Assessment Tool and Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model. In the real LUCC case which considers the actual land use changes between 2000 and 2011, the absolute contributions of LUCC to the variations in water yield and ET are slight and almost have the same magnitude for different baseline period choices, whereas those of climate change are substantial andwith varyingmagnitudes. Comparedwith the absolute contributions, the relative contributions of climate change and LUCC seemless sensitive to the choices of baseline periods. In the hypothetical LUCC casewhich assumes an extreme land use conversion (i. e., grassland converts to farmland completely), both climate change and LUCC contribute to the changes inwater yield and ET significantly. Moreover, both the absolute and relative contributions diverge noticeably between various baseline period choices. The influences of baseline period choices on the partitioning of hydrological impacts diverge significantly between different hydrological models. This study highlights that baseline period choice is an important source of uncertainty when disentangling the impacts of LUCC and climate change on hydrology. Some useful recommendations regarding baseline period selection have been proposed, whichmay help to reduce the uncertainties associatedwith baseline period choices. (c) 2017 Elsevier B. V.

In this paper, a fine -scale hydrologic model -Personal Computer Storm Water Management Model (PCSWMM) -was applied to predict the individual and joint impacts of LULC changes and CC on surface runoff attributes (peak and volume) in 3800 urban subwatersheds in Midwest Florida. The subwatersheds a range of characteristics in terms of drainage area, surface imperviousness, ground slope and LULC distribution. The PCSWMM also represented several hydraulic structures (e.g., ponds and pipes) across the subwatersheds. We analyzed changes in the runoff attributes to determine which stressor is most responsible for the changes and what subwatersheds are mostly sensitive to such changes. Six 24-h design rainfall events (5- to 200 -year recurrence intervals) were studied under historical (2010) and future (year 2070) climate and LULC. We evaluated the response of the subwatersheds in terms of runoff peak and volume to the design rainfall events using the PCSWMM. The results indicated that, overall, CC has a greater impact on the runoff attributes than LULC change. We also found that LULC and climate induced changes in runoff are generally more pronounced in greater recurrence intervals and subwatersheds with smaller drainage areas and milder slopes. However, no relationship was found between the changes in runoff and original subwatershed imperviousness; this can be due to the small increase in urban land cover projected for the study area.

Increases in streamflow and rises in groundwater level after clearing of forest are caused by increased groundwater recharge rate due to decrease of evapotranspiration. Seasonal and long-term changes in streamflow are discussed and need to be studied more. Increases in salinity of streamwater after clearing of forest are caused by the rising water table which mobilises the salt stored in soil previously. Increases in nitrate, K, Mg and Ca of streamwater after clear-cutting are caused by increased rates of mineralization and nitrification due to the increase of soil temperature, and increased losses from soil due to increased groundwater flow.

Here, we employed two sequential datasets from Switzerland (for the periods 1979-1985 and 1992-1997) to show how land-use and land cover data can be used to investigate such large scale ecological and land cover change processes. We applied a combination of generalized additive and generalized linear modelling to develop spatially explicit statistical models for land cover transitions between any of the following types: intensively used agricultural land, extensively used agricultural land, overgrown areas, open canopy forest, closed canopy forest. Climate, soil, relief-related data, basic socio-economic variables and information about the composition of the surrounding neighbourhood of the samples were utilised as potential predictors of land cover change. The proportion of variance explained differed considerably between models but a consistently high AUC for both calibration and evaluation datasets was achieved for the majority of the 25, with resulting values ranging from 0.58 to 0.96. The model residuals showed some degree of spatial autocorrelation despite the use of a sparse sampling regime and the inclusion of neighbourhood variables. We conclude that the analysis of sequential land cover datasets using the kind of statistical models developed here offers a promising way to investigate ecological processes such as forest succession at a large spatial scale.

In this regard, LCM model based on artificial neural network (ANN) and Markov chain analysis used to predict LULC in the future. Then, the effect of LULC changes on flood susceptibility was investigated using some ML algorithms, including ANN, logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM). These four algorithms were used for the first time simultaneously to generate flood susceptibility maps in the present and future. Nine influencing factors, including altitude, slope, distance from rivers, land use and land cover, topographic wetness index, stream power index, profile curvature, rainfall, soil type, and 200 flood and nonflood locations, were utilized to create the flood susceptibility map. The selected ML models were assessed using root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2). RMSE values showed high performance of SVM, LR, RF, and ANN models with values of 0.125, 0.175, 0.1920, and 0.2834, respectively.

By contrast, grazing has increased due to low labor costs and economic policies that provide incentives for cattle production in Mexico.

The spatiotemporal dynamics of water fluxes and their relationship with land cover changes between 2009 and 2017 in the headwater Buzi sub-catchment in Zimbabwe is evaluated. To achieve this, land cover dynamics for the area under study were characterised from the 30 m Landsat data, using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm. After the land cover classification, the key water balance components namely; interception, transpiration and evapotranspiration (ET) contributions for each class in 2009 and 2017 were estimated. Image classification of Landsat data achieved good overall accuracies above 80% for the two periods. Results showed that the percentage of the plantation land cover types decreased slightly between 2009 (25.4%) and 2017 (22.5%). Partitioning the annual interception, transpiration and ET according to land cover classes showed that the highest amounts of ET in the basin were from plantation where land cover types with tea had the highest interception, transpiration and ET in the catchment. Higher ET, interception and transpiration were observed in the eastern parts of the catchment. At catchment level, results show that 2017 had a higher water balance than 2009, which was partly explained by the decrease in plantation cover type.",Plantations,Evapotranspiration,Land cover change,XGBoost,Water flux,,,"Dube, Timothy","Mushore, Terence",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigates the impacts of climate and land use/land cover (LULC) change on water resources in an intensively instrumented inland valley catchment in Southwestern Burkina Faso. An ensemble of five regional climate models (RCMs) and two climate scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) was utilized to drive a physically-based hydrological model WaSiM after calibration and validation. The impact of climate change was quantified by comparing the projected period (2021-2050) and a reference period (1971-2000). The result showed a large uncertainty in the future change of runoff between the RCMs. Three models projected an increase in the total runoff from +12% to +95%, whereas two models predicted a decrease from -44% to -24%. Surface runoff was projected to show the highest relative change compared to the other runoff components. The projected LULC 2019, 2025, and 2030 were estimated based on historical LULC change (1990-2013) using the Land Change Modeler (LCM). A gradual conversion of savanna to cropland was shown, with annual rates rom 1 to 3.3%. WaSiM was used to simulate a gradual increase in runoff with time caused by this land use change. The combined climate and land use change was estimated using LULC-2013 in the reference period and LULC-2030 as future land use. The results suggest that land use change exacerbates the increase in total runoff. The increase in runoff was found to be +158% compared to the reference period but only +52% without land use change impacts. This stresses the fact that land use change impact is not negligible in this area, and climate change impact assessments without land use change analysis might be misleading. The results of this study can be used as input to water management models in order to derive strategies to cope with present and future water scarcities for smallholder farming in the investigated area.",WaSiM,inland valley,West African hydrology,Land Change Modeler,CORDEX-Africa,land use change,climate change,"Op de Hipt, Felix","Naeschen, Kristian","Pomeon, Thomas","Yira, Yacouba","Ibrahim, Boubacar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This puts these critical community-based food production systems at risk as California is expected to experience increasing weather extremes. In agricultural systems, increased vegetation complexity, such as greater structure or biodiversity, can increase the resilience of food production systems from climate fluctuations. We test this theory in 15 urban gardens across California's Central Coast. Local-and landscape-scale measures of ground, vegetation, and land cover were collected in and around each garden, while climate loggers recorded temperatures in each garden in 30 min increments. Multivariate analyses, using county as a random factor, show that both local-and landscape-scale factors were important. All factors were significant predictors of mean temperature. Tallest vegetation, tree/shrub species richness, grass cover, mulch cover, and landscape level agricultural cover were cooling factors; in contrast, garden size, garden age, rock cover, herbaceous species richness, and landscape level urban cover were warming factors. Results were similar for the maximum temperature analysis except that agriculture land cover and herbaceous species richness were not significant predictors of maximum temperature. Analysis of gardener watering behavior to observed temperatures shows that garden microclimate was significantly related to the number of minutes watered as well as the number of liters of water used per watering event. Thus gardeners seem to respond to garden microclimate in their watering behavior even though this behavior is most probably motivated by a range of other factors such as water regulations and time availability. This research shows that local management of ground cover and vegetation can reduce mean and maximum temperatures in gardens, and the reduced temperatures may influence watering behavior of gardeners.

The goal of this paper was to quantify the drivers of LCLU using long-term Landsat data from 1972 to 2010. First, we produced LCLU maps by using Landsat images from 1972, 1982, 1990, 2000, and 2010. Next, tract level population data of 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010 were converted to 1-km square grid cells. Then, the LCLU maps were integrated with basic grid cell data to represent the proportion of each land cover category within a grid cell area. Finally, the proportional land cover maps and population census data were combined to investigate the relationship between land cover and population change based on grid cells using Pearson's correlation coefficient, ordinary least square (OLS), and local level geographically weighted regression (GWR). Land cover changes in terms of the percentage of area affected and rates of change were compared with population census data with a focus on the analysis of the spatial-temporal dynamics of urban growth patterns. The correlation coefficients of land cover categories and population changes were calculated for two decadal intervals between 1970 and 2010. Our results showed a causal relationship between LCLU changes and population dynamics over the last 40 years. Urban sprawl was positively correlated with population change. However, the relationship was not linear over space and time. Spatial heterogeneity and variations in the relationship demonstrate that urban sprawl was positively correlated with population changes in suburban area and negatively correlated in urban core and inner suburban area of the St. Louis Metropolitan Statistical Area. These results suggest that the imagery reflects processes of urban growth, inner-city decline, population migration, and social spatial inequality. The implications provide guidance for sustainable urban planning and development. We also demonstrate that grid cells allow robust synthesis of remote sensing and socioeconomic data to advance our knowledge of urban growth dynamics from both spatial and temporal scales and its association with population change.

As a result, preexisting data are often used for validation. Temporal, spatial, and attribute differences between the land cover product and pre-existing validation data can result in inconclusive depictions of map accuracy. This approach may therefore misrepresent the true accuracy of the land cover product, as well as the accuracy of the validation data, which is not assumed to be without error. Hence, purpose-acquired validation data is preferred; however, logistical constraints often preclude its use - especially for large area land cover products. Airborne digital video provides a cost-effective tool for collecting purpose-acquired validation data over large areas. An operational trial was conducted, involving the collection of airborne video for the validation of a 31,000 km(2) sub-sample of the Canadian large area Earth Observation for Sustainable Development of Forests (EOSD) land cover map (Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada). In this trial, one form of agreement between the EOSD product and the airborne video data was defined as a match between the mode land cover class of a 3 by 3 pixel neighbourhood surrounding the sample pixel and the primary or secondary choice of land cover for the interpreted video. This scenario produced the highest level of overall accuracy at 77% for level 4 of classification hierarchy (13 classes). The coniferous treed class, which represented 71% of Vancouver Island, had an estimated user's accuracy of 86%.

Congo),LAND,FEB 2021,10,"In the tropics, the domestic water supply depends principally on ecosystem services, including the regulation and purification of water by humid, dense tropical forests. The Yangambi Biosphere Reserve (YBR) landscape is situated within such forests in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Surprisingly, given its proximity to the Congo River, the YBR is confronted with water issues. As part of its ecosystem function, the landscape is expected to reduce deterioration of water quality. However, environmental consequences are increasing due to conversion of its dense forest into other types of land use/land cover (LULC) in response to human activities. It is therefore important to check how the physicochemical quality parameters of water resources are influenced by landscape parameters-and to know if the population can adapt to this water vulnerability. To do this, we analyzed the watershed typology (including morphometric and LULC characteristics) and the physical and chemical parameters of water within the principal watershed's rivers. We also analyzed data from surveys and the Yangambi meteorological station. We found that some landscape indices related to LULC significantly influence water quality deterioration in Yangambi. On average, each person in the Yangambi landscape uses 29-43 liters of water per day. Unfortunately, this falls short of World Health Organization standards regarding some parameters. The best fitted simple linear regression model explains the variation in pH as a function of edge density of perturbed forest, edge density of crop land and patch density of dense forest up to 94%, 92% and 90%, respectively. While many researchers have identified the consequences of climate change and human activities on these water resources, the population is not well-equipped to deal with them. These results suggest that water management policies should consider the specificities of the Yangambi landscape in order to develop better mitigation strategies for a rational management of water resources in the YBR in the context of climate change.",watershed typology,land use/land cover,hypsometric characteristics,water physicochemical parameters,climate change,water vulnerability,Yangambi,"Itunda, Destin","Chishugi, Josue Bahati","Felix, Fiyo Losembe","Sahani, Muhindo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Congo Basin,,,,,,,,,,,

However, as the land cover changes rapidly due to population growth, there are inevitable changes in the water budget. In Korea, there has been a huge loss in natural land among OECD countries, but relatively little research has been executed for the relationship between surface changes and groundwater. In review, we discuss how the land surface changes affect on groundwater level. First, as the ground surface is made less permeable by economic growth, local recharge can be diminished so that regional recharge can affect on groundwater level. As a result, the peak flow decreases and the lag time increases in groundwater hydrograph as compared to that of stream. Second, when natural land converts to agricultural land and there are changes in vegetation by removing forests for development, the increase or decrease in groundwater level can be caused by changes in the amount of evapotranspiration. Finally, an artificial groundwater flow can be created if urban infrastructures are constructed below the surface due to regional development such as urbanization. Leakage water from this structure flows into the aquifer, but this may lead to groundwater table increase and contamination. These factors, increases in impervious cover, changes in agricultural land/forest areas and urban infrastructures, cause fluctuations in groundwater level. Therefore, for the preservation of groundwater, these factors should be identified in advance and prepared by constant monitoring.",groundwater level,land surface change,land cover change,groundwater recharge,hydrograph,,,"Ko, Kyung-Seok",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The stable type of LULC change was the most widely distributed, followed by the later change type (2010-2018) and mainly distributed in the flat valley, with the largest change range of cultivated land, forest land and grassland. (2) The LEEQ was generally well, but gradually deteriorates. The obvious change of LEEQ was found after 2010. The deterioration type of quality mostly occurs around the city, while the getting better type occurs in the transition area between the city and the mountains. (3) There are more deterioration categories than improvement categories of LULC transfer from 1980 to 2018.

To retrieve the spatial pattern of heat fluxes in the Beijing metropolitan area, China, a remote sensing-based energy balance model was calibrated with synchronously measured energy fluxes including net radiation, latent heat flux (LE), and sensible heat flux (H). Our model calibration approach avoided the uncertainties due to subjective judgments in previous empirical parameterization methods.

Our findings that indicate thermal dissipation through vegetation transpiration might play an important role in urban heat regulation.

Generally, research on PBs is conducted from the beach towards offshore. Studies on the land use/land cover (LULC) of PBs are limited and currently lacking. Such studies deserve more investigation due to the importance of LULC in PBs' functioning. In this study, supervised classification methods were investigated for LULC mapping of the PBs located in the province of Messina. Sentinel-2B satellite images were analyzed using maximum likelihood (MaL), minimum distance (MiD), mahalanobis distance (MaD) and spectral angle mapper (SAM) classification methods. The study was conducted mainly in order to determine which classification method would be adequate for small scale Sentinel-2 imagery analysis and provide accurate results for the LULC mapping of PBs. In addition, an occurrence-based filter algorithm in conjunction with OpenStreetMap data and Google Earth imagery was used to extract linear features within 500 m of the inland buffer zone of the PBs. The results demonstrate that information on the biophysical parameters, namely surface cover fractions, of the coastal area can be obtained by conducting LULC mapping on Sentinel-2 images.",land use,land cover,climate change,OpenStreetMap,earth observation satellites,pocket beach,maximum likelihood,"Gregorio, Francesco","Lanza, Stefania","Muzirafuti, Anselme",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,minimum distance,mahalanobis distance,,,,,,spectral angle mapper,image classification,,,

These LULC changes have grave implications for water resources and the surface hydrology. This study was aimed at specifically quantifying the extent of LULC changes and the implications for surface hydrology of the study area. The study investigated the spatiotemporal effects of LULC on the hydrology of the basin of Enugu State, Nigeria, using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). SWAT model has been extensively used to study watershed response to rainfall and LULC dynamics. The trend of the basin's LULC was studied over two decades. The watershed was delineated into 17 sub-basins using SRTM digital elevation model. The delineation of the watershed and the extraction of the stream network were enabled by SAGA Strahler order plug-in. The model results showed that the basin's soil composition, associated with moderately high run-off, remains somewhat static during the 20-year study period. The soil types were distributed as follows: plinthic acrisols (42.4%), ferric acrisols (11.9%) and dystric nitosols (45.7%), with Ap15-1a-1068 being the most dominant and comprising 66% sand. All soil types in the study area belong to the hydrological soil group C. The LUCL of the basin (3027.4 km(2)) comprised of rangeland (2414.57 km(2)), built-up (57.46 km(2)), cropland (541.25 km(2)), forest (11.25 km(2)) and water (0.21 km(2)). Over the two decades of interest, the basin has undergone LULC changes of - 14.71%, 21.29%, 50.62%, 98% and 0.00% in rangeland, built-up area, cropland, forest and water body, respectively. The changes led to encroachment, alterations and diversification of LULC types of the sub-basins, resulting in changes in their surface characteristics and an increase in the number of hydrologic response units (HRUs) within the sub-basins from 74 in 2001 to 97 in 2019. Out of the 17 sub-basins, the HRU increased in 12, decreased in 2 and stayed the same in 3 sub-basins. Increase in the number of HRUs is significantly higher for HRUs smaller than 100 km(2). The major trend of LULC changes is the conversion of rangeland to residential area and agricultural land due to aggressive urbanization and rising need for food production to meet the demands of increasing population. Proper legislation should be put in place to ensure that the impact of urbanization and activities of herdsmen be contained and re-aligned with the sustainable development goals.",Land use,Land cover,Change,Spatiotemporal,Dynamics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since quantitative assessment of changes in LULC is one of the most efficient means to understand and manage the land transformation, there is a need to examine the accuracy of different algorithms for LULC mapping in order to identify the best classifier for further applications of earth observations. In this article, six machine-learning algorithms, namely random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy adaptive resonance theory-supervised predictive mapping (Fuzzy ARTMAP), spectral angle mapper (SAM) and Mahalanobis distance (MD) were examined. Accuracy assessment was performed by using Kappa coefficient, receiver operational curve (RoC), index-based validation and root mean square error (RMSE). Results of Kappa coefficient show that all the classifiers have a similar accuracy level with minor variation, but the RF algorithm has the highest accuracy of 0.89 and the MD algorithm (parametric classifier) has the least accuracy of 0.82. In addition, the index-based LULC and visual cross-validation show that the RF algorithm (correlations between RF and normalised differentiation water index, normalised differentiation vegetation index and normalised differentiation built-up index are 0.96, 0.99 and 1, respectively, at 0.05 level of significance) has the highest accuracy level in comparison to the other classifiers adopted. Findings from the literature also proved that ANN and RF algorithms are the best LULC classifiers, although a non-parametric classifier like SAM (Kappa coefficient 0.84; area under curve (AUC) 0.85) has a better and consistent accuracy level than the other machine-learning algorithms. Finally, this review concludes that the RF algorithm is the best machine-learning LULC classifier, among the six examined algorithms although it is necessary to further test the RF algorithm in different morphoclimatic conditions in the future.",land use,land cover (LULC),Earth observations,machine learning algorithm,random forest,artificial neural network,,Shahfahad,"Pal, Swades","Liou, Yuei-An","Rahman, Atiqur",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, substantial advancement has been achieved in generating such data products. Yet, we are far from producing geospatially consistent high-quality data at an operational level. We compared the recently available Global Land Cover 2000 (GLC-2000) and MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) global land cover data to evaluate the similarities and differences in methodologies and results, and to identify areas of spatial agreement and disagreement. These two global land cover data sets were prepared using different data sources, classification systems, and methodologies, but using the same spatial resolution (i.e., 1 km) satellite data. Our analysis shows a general agreement at the class aggregate level except for savannas/shrublands, and wetlands. The disagreement, however, increases when comparing detailed land cover classes. Similarly, percent agreement between the two data sets was found to be highly variable among biomes. The identified areas of spatial agreement and disagreement will be useful for both data producers and users. Data producers may use the areas of spatial agreement for training area selection and pay special attention to areas of disagreement for further improvement in future land cover characterization and mapping. Users can conveniently use the findings in the areas of agreement, whereas users might need to verify the information in the areas of disagreement with the help of secondary information. Learning from past experience and building on the existing infrastructure (e.g., regional networks), further research is necessary to (1) reduce ambiguity in land cover definitions, (2) increase availability of improved spatial, spectral, radiometric, and geometric resolution satellite data, and (3) develop advanced classification algorithms.

The simulation and prediction of LULC in a large-scale basin in an arid zone can help the future land management planning and rational allocation of resources in this ecologically fragile region. Using the whole Ili-Balkhash Basin as the study area, the patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model and a combination of PLUS and Markov predictions (PLUS-Markov) were used to simulate and predict land use in 2020 based on the assessment of the accuracy of LULC classification in the global dataset. The accuracy of simulations and predictions using the model were measured for LULC data covering different time periods. Model settings with better simulation results were selected for simulating and predicting possible future land use conditions in the basin. The future predictions for 2025 and 2030, which are based on historical land change characteristics, indicate that the overall future spatial pattern of LULC in the basin remains relatively stable in general without the influence of other external factors. Over the time scale of the future five years, the expansion of croplands and barren areas in the basin primarily stems from the loss of grasslands. Approximately 48% of the converted grassland areas are transformed into croplands, while around 40% are converted into barren areas. In the longer time scale of the future decade, the conversion of grasslands to croplands in the basin is also evident. However, the expansion phenomenon of urban and built-up lands at the expense of croplands is more significant, with approximately 774.2 km(2) of croplands developing into urban and built-up lands.

An accurate simulation of the LST spatial distribution heavily rely on the accuracy of the land surface characteristics, such as LULC (land use/land cover). To investigate the impact of uncertainty in LULC maps on LST simulation, the Community Land Model, version 4.5 (CLM4.5), was used in this study with four LULC products as overlying vegetation characteristics. East China, with its complex land surface characteristics, was employed as the study area. The simulation results were compared to the observations at nine China Meteorological Administration (CMA) stations and to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data (MOIDIS_LST) over the whole study region. Based on the comparison at CMA stations, CLM4.5 can properly simulate ground temperature. However, large differences are found between MODIS_LST and the simulated LST, particularly over crop areas. Comparison of simulated results using different LULC products showed a large dissimilarity over forest areas, mainly due to the different identification methods for forest types. Large biases in the prescribed leaf area index (LAI) of the model are also found compared with MODIS_LAI. Then, the LAI in the model default data was replaced by the MODIS_LAI product, which greatly reduces the LST simulation biases.

Furthermore, spectral indices of the SPOT image were calculated for each band and each segment; therefore, each segment was characterized from the images (spectral indices) and the map (class label). In order to detect uncertain areas which present discrepancy between spectral response and class label, a multivariate trimming, which consists in truncating a distribution from its least likely values, was applied. The segments that behave like outliers were detected and labeled as ""uncertain"" and a probable alternative category was determined by means of a digital classification using a decision tree classification algorithm. Then, the segments were visually inspected in the SPOT image and high resolution imagery to assign a final category. The same procedure was applied to update the map to 2014 using Landsat imagery.

First, in the spatial domain, researchers rarely consider the impact of scaling up fine-scale LULC data to match coarse-scale climate datasets. Second, in the temporal domain, climate data typically have sub-daily, daily, monthly, or annual resolution, but LULC datasets often have much coarser (e. g., decadal) resolution. We first explored the effect of three spatial scaling methods on correlations among LULC data and a land surface climatic variable, latent heat flux in China. Scaling by a fractional method preserved significant correlations among LULC data and latent heat flux at all three studied scales (0.50, 1.0', and 2.50), whereas nearest-neighbor and majority-aggregation methods caused these correlations to diminish and even become statistically non-significant at coarser spatial scales (i.e., 2.5 degrees). In the temporal domain, we identified fractional changes in croplands, forests, and grasslands in China using a recently developed and annually resolved time series of LULC maps from 1982 to 2012. Relative to common LULC change (LULCC) analyses conducted over two-time steps or several time periods, this annually resolved, 31-year time series of LULC maps enables robust interpretation of LULCC. Specifically, the annual resolution of these data enabled us to more precisely observe three key and statistically significant LULCC trends and transitions that could have consequential effects on land-atmosphere interaction: (1) decreasing grasslands to increasing croplands in the Northeast China plain and the Yellow river basin, (2) decreasing croplands to increasing forests in the Yangtze river basin, and (3) decreasing grasslands to increasing forests in Southwest China. Our study not only demonstrates the importance of using a fractional spatial rescaling method, but also illustrates the value of annually resolved LULC time series for detecting significant trends and transitions in LULCC, thus potentially facilitating a more robust use of remotely sensed data in land-atmosphere interaction studies.",scale issue,land use and land cover change,time-series analysis,croplands,forests,grasslands,China,"Lee, Eungul",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, a method is developed to separate the signals from the noise in RCM simulations of the effects of changes in land use, using perturbed initial boundary conditions (PICs). We want to know how many ensemble members are required to identify robust and statistically significant land-use land cover change (LULCC) effects from RCM LULCC studies. The method is applied to a case study of urbanization and deforestation, for which LULCC scenarios are implemented in the RCM Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF). Based on WRF ensemble simulations with PICs for 2010, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is used to identify areas with pronounced effect of an LULCC or, rather, the parametrization of the land-use classes. While in the urbanization scenarios clear and statistically significant signals are found for air temperature and for both latent- and sensible heat (SNR values up to 24), the effects are less pronounced for precipitation, and for deforestation in general (SNR values < 1). For the case study of urbanization and precipitation, the impact of the ensemble size is studied in order to derive robust conclusions about the effects of LULCC on precipitation. We conclude that single RCM realizations of different land-use representations are not sufficient to derive LULCC-induced signals, particularly not for precipitation. Small ensemble sizes led to concluding there were significant LULCC-induced precipitation signals, but these disappeared when the ensemble size was increased. Our regional analysis suggests the need for ensemble sizes well above 10 for precipitation.",perturbed initial conditions,RCM ensemble simulations,signal-to-noise separation,urbanization,deforestation,Weather Research Forecasting (WRF),Vietnam,Tan Phan Van,"Kunstmann, Harald",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,land-use land cover change,,,,,,,,,,,

The Soil and Water Assessment Tool model was used to evaluate the individual and combined impacts of land use/land cover and climate on the hydrology of the Muga watershed. The model was calibrated and validated based on observed streamflow data. The calibrated and validated model demonstrated good performance, as indicated by Nash Sutcliff Efficiency values of 0.79 for calibration and 0.82 for validation. Similarly, the Percentage of Bias values of 8.2% for calibration and 9.3% for validation indicate a small overall bias in the model's predictions. According to the findings of this study, there is an overall increase in surface runoff (15.78% in 2022 and 15.28% in 2038) and water yield (1.22% in 2022; 0.83% in 2038), along with a reduction in lateral flow (8.55% in 2022; 7.0% in 2038), groundwater flow (9.21% in 2022; 10.0% in 2028), streamflow (5.8% in 2022; 3.3% in 2038), and evapotranspiration (1.54% in 2022; 0.95% in 2038), compared to the baseline year (1994). The land use/land cover changes in 2022 and projected for 2038 contributed to these alterations in hydrological parameters. The combined effect of land use/land cover and climate change on water balance is relatively higher than the impact of land use/land cover change scenario alone. The intensified rainfall contributes to the observed increase in surface runoff and water yield. Hence, the study is crucial to implementing sustainable land use practices and appropriate watershed management strategies.Climate change is a global concern affecting many landscape characteristics.

We combined data on land cover, management intensity and livestock available on the European and global scale in a geographic information system based approach. We put special emphasis on agro-silvo-pastoral mosaic systems: multifunctional Mediterranean landscapes hosting different human activities that are not represented in common land cover maps. By analyzing location conditions of the identified land systems, we demonstrated the significance of both bio-physical (precipitation, soil) and socio-economic (population density, Market influence) factors driving the occurrence of these systems. Agro-silvo-pastoral mosaic systems were estimated to cover 23.3% of the Mediterranean ecoregion and exhibited to a certain extent similar characteristics as forest and cropland systems. A reanalysis using data that are available with global coverage indicated that the choice of datasets leads to significant uncertainties in the extent and spatial pattern of these systems.

It is affected by climate change, and Land Use/Land Cover Change (LULCC). This paper quantifies the combined impact of LULCC and climate change on water yield over short and long-term periods in the Haraz basin, Iran. This basin has experienced severe forest degradation, agricultural expansion, and urbanization. Most agricultural lands are within the plains and coastal areas, and 25% of the basin is covered by forest, which includes part of the Hyrcanian conservation forests. Four scenarios to distinguish the relative portion of Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) and climate for water supply variations are considered, including real conditions at the beginning of the period (Sn1), real conditions without changes in LULC (Sn2), real conditions without climate change (Sn3), and real conditions at the end of the period (Sn4). Four study periods include 1992-2007, 2007-2016, 2016-2026 as a short term, and 1992-2026 as a long-term period. The spatial patterns of annual precipitation showed decreasing amounts in the three studied years from the northwest to the south. Water yield also reduced during the study period 1992-2007 and 2007-2016, and climate change plays an essential role in this reduction. Forecasts show that rainfall will recover in 2026 and water yield will increase in the northern sub-basins. In the long run, from 1992 to 2026, the contribution of LULCC and climate change factors to water yield are equal.

The study focuses on the upper Zambezi Basin (UZB) in southern Africa, which is one of the regions with high rates of land degradation globally. Landsat satellite imagery is utilised to generate historical (1993-2023) land cover and land use (LCLU) maps for the UZB, while the global European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) LCLU maps are obtained from the Trends.Earth module. The CA-Markov chain model is employed to predict future LCLU changes between 2023 and 2043. The LCD model in the Trends.Earth module in QGIS 3.32.3 is then used to assess the historical and forecasted land cover degradation status. The findings reveal that land cover degradation maps produced from local LCLU classifications provide more detailed information compared to those produced from the global ESA CCI LCLU product. Between 2023 and 2043, the UZB is predicted to experience a net reduction of approximately 3.2 million hectares of forest cover, with an average annual reduction rate of - 0.13%. In terms of land cover degradation, the UZB is forecasted to remain generally stable, with 87% and 96% of the total land cover area expected to be stable during the periods 2023-2033 and 2033-2043, respectively, relative to the base years 2023 and 2033. Reduction in forest cover due to the expansion of grassland, human settlements, and cropland is projected to drive land cover degradation, while improvements in forest cover are anticipated through the conversion of grassland and cropland into forested areas. It appears that using locally produced LCLU with high-resolution images provides better assessments of land degradation in the Trends.Earth module than using global LCLU products. By leveraging the opportunities offered by models with capacity to predict LCLU such as the CA-Markov model and the capabilities of the LCD model, as evidenced in this study, valuable forecasted information can be effectively obtained for monitoring land cover degradation.

Prioritization based on Geographic Information Science (GIS) platform, allows us to take informed decisions for managing and safeguarding resources from degradation. Quantitative morphometric analysis of three aspects, namely linearity, shape and relief, were carried out for sub-watersheds encompassing the entire study area. In addition, Remote Sensing (RS) based on high-resolution multispectral data with 10 m spatial resolution captured by Sentinel 2 satellite was analysed to infer the land cover condition. In water-induced soil erosion, morphometric parameters have crucial role in understanding the geo-environmental characteristics of the terrain. Moreover, rainfall effects depend on the pattern of LULC change and each land cover responds differently to the raindrop energy it receives. Therefore, it requires integration of the geomorphological and hydrological characteristics of the sub-watersheds derived from their morphometric parameters with the LULC to generate compounded ranking-based prioritization of the sub-watersheds. During the prioritization analysis, the lower compound value is considered with higher priority for appropriate soil conservation measures. It was found that the integration of morphometric and LULC factors changed the prioritization ranking considerably. Incidentally, Sub-watershed 4 which was having moderate raking based on morphomertic analysis, got highest rank and compound value of 2.38 due to integrated approach. It was evident that the use of an integrated prioritization approach helps us to arrive at better decision-making related to soil conservation.",Morphometric parameters,Land use land cover (LULC),Prioritization,Soil erosion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The total land cover change area increased by over 21,000 ha or 11% but remained at around 1% of the total land area of the UK. Rotation forestry mostly of conifer forests was a dominant type of land cover change in both periods (53% of overall change from 2000 to 2006 and 54% from 2006 to 2012), followed by growth and replanting of conifer forest. From 2006 to 2012 the replanting rate decreased by almost 15,000 ha compared to 2000-2006 and a smaller decrease in planting of broadleaf and mixed forests was also observed. Urban land take continued from 2006 to 2012 in the UK, with over 16,000 ha of increase in artificial surfaces. The rate of change from other land cover types to artificial surfaces accelerated from 2006 to 2012. However, we urge caution when interpreting the rate of land take, as it includes wind farms in forested areas which leave the forest largely intact apart from an access road and the wind turbine sites. We also found that the inference from the land cover change matrices is dependent on the level of class aggregation (level 1, 2 or 3).",Land cover,Land use,Land use change,Land take,Urbanisation,Forest cover,Copernicus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Multispectral,Image interpretation,,,,,,,,,,

This study uses Landsat data (1991-2022) to examine the spatio-temporal dynamics of LST and LULC in Jaipur, highlighting the impact of urban expansion and the city's semi-arid nature on the thermal landscape. We have used the maximum likelihood classifier for supervised LULC classification and the mono-window algorithm for retrieving LST. The evaluation is done using buffer analysis. Furthermore, to assess the interrelationship between LST and LULC indices (NDVI & NDBI), regression analysis is used. The CA-ANN model is employed to project LSTs of 2032 and 2042. The findings indicate that the built-up land in the study area grew by 52.80% from 1991-2022. Most of this expansion has come at the expense of agriculture/open land, and vegetation cover. The mean LST in the city has risen by 5.9 degrees C, with the inner zone (B1) increasing from 35.44 degrees C to 41.93 degrees C, indicating urbanisation-induced heat stress. In the outer zones (B5-B6), dry sandy and rocky soils contribute to elevated temperatures. Water bodies show the lowest LST, while open and barren lands have the highest. LST exhibit a positive correlation with NDBI and a weak negative correlation with NDVI. Predictions indicate that by 2042, about 99% of the urban landscape will encounter surface temperatures above 40 degrees C, with 28.79% exceeding 45 degrees C. Raised temperatures could exacerbate the UHI effect, leading to serious health and environmental concerns.",Mono-window algorithm,LST (Land Surface Temperature),LULC (Land use/Land cover),UHI (Urban Heat Island),CA-ANN (Cellular Automata-Artificial Neural Network),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One such application is a Web-based system for automating the collection of reference data for producing and verifying the accuracy of land-use/land-cover (LULC) maps derived from satellite imagery. Here we describe the capabilities and technical components of the Virtual Interpretation of Earth Web-Interface Tool (VIEW-IT), a collaborative browser-based tool for ""crowdsourcing"" interpretation of reference data from high resolution imagery. The principal component of VIEW-IT is the Google Earth plug-in, which allows users to visually estimate percent cover of seven basic LULC classes within a sample grid. The current system provides a 250 m square sample to match the resolution of MODIS satellite data, although other scales could be easily accommodated. Using VIEW-IT, a team of 23 student and 7 expert interpreters collected over 46,000 reference samples across Latin America and the Caribbean. Samples covered all biomes, avoided spatial autocorrelation, and spanned years 2000 to 2010. By embedding Google Earth within a Web-based application with an intuitive user interface, basic interpretation criteria, distributed Internet access, server-side storage, and automated error-checking, VIEW-IT provides a time and cost efficient means of collecting a large dataset of samples across space and time. When matched with predictor variables from satellite imagery, these data can provide robust mapping algorithm calibration and accuracy assessment. This development is particularly important for regional to global scale LULC mapping efforts, which have traditionally relied on sparse sampling of medium resolution imagery and products for reference data.

The classification of remote sensing images is an effective approach for generating land cover maps. Two main strategies for producing continuous multiphase land cover maps are available: classifying each phase image separately and developing a new phase map by using two-phase images to extract land cover changes and update products, that is, incremental updating. In incremental updating, only the target area that has changed is updated. Incremental updating has the characteristics of minimal processing time and easy data transformation. The accuracy of the incremental updating of land cover products is mainly affected by two aspects: 1) the classification accuracy of land cover change patches and 2) the splicing fit between the change patches and the baseline map to be updated. In this paper, the fragment polygons caused by the second issue are discussed, and a method is proposed to obtain a new phase of land cover classification map via patch mosaic.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between meteorological data collected from 30 stations between 2016 and 2022 and Istanbul's LULCs and LCZs. Several notable findings were uncovered, providing light on the UHI phenomenon and its consequences for the city's characteristics. The stations in urban areas (typology A) had higher temperatures than stations in rural/suburban (typology B) and forested landscape (typology C). Those yearly values were similar to 1 degrees C for monthly mean temperatures and similar to 1.5 degrees C for monthly minimum temperatures. Moreover, urban areas possessed +4 and +2 hot days (35 degrees C and above) for typologies B and C, respectively. Another remarkable result was that stations situated close to water surfaces exhibited a lower tendency to exceed temperatures of 35 degrees C. Furthermore, built-type LCZs wind velocity achieved a lower value than land cover type, and humidity in typology A was 5% and 10% less than the typologies B and C, respectively.

In this study, the change in the amount of arable land in Tanzania and its main determinants were identified, and suggestions for agricultural land management policy were put forward. For this purpose, datasets related to spatial, biophysical, demographic, and socio-economic variables that can affect the amount of arable land were prepared and analysed with appropriate econometric models. The coefficients of the established models were estimated by the Engle-Granger method and according to the results of the forecast; the increase in amount of variables such as gross domestic product (GDP), the quantity of exported goods, annual population growth and the amount of arable land per capita cause a positive effect in the amount of total arable land compared to an increase in other land use areas such as residential settlement areas, infrastructure land areas, while the increase in the presence of forested land has a negative effect on the amount of arable land. On the other hand, the results of the Granger causality test, conducted to analyse the causality relationships among the GDP, annual population growth, residential areas and other lands and arable land have determined that there is causality of residential areas and other lands to arable land with annual population growth. According to the results of the research, the demographic and socio-economic factors have been determined to have a greater influence on the change in the amount of arable land in Tanzania. In this context, it is possible to contribute to the sustainability of land resources by developing non-agricultural activities and opportunities by reducing population pressure on the land, as well as developing efforts towards land ownership and tenure systems in rural areas and urban fringe premises.",Agricultural land,Arable land,Land use and land cover change (LULCC),Econometric models,Tanzania,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quantifying changes in LST due to individual perturbations caused by LULCC is an attribution problem. Most attribution methods are based on the first-order Taylor series expansion (FOTSE) of a linearized SEB equation. The accuracy of these methods is affected by the use of FOTSE at two places. The first is to linearize the SEB equation and to obtain an analytical solution for LST (the LST model), and the second is to obtain LST changes as the linear sum of concurrent changes in multiple factors (the attribution model). In this study, we systematically assess the importance of non-linear effects lost in these linearization processes using the second-order Taylor series expansion (SOTSE). Results show that while the SOTSE LST model outperforms the FOTSE LST model, the order of Taylor series expansion in the LST model does not significantly influence the attribution of LST changes. However, the SOTSE attribution model is considerably more accurate than the FOTSE attribution model, especially when the magnitude of perturbations is large. Results suggest that contributions from higher-order and cross-order terms in the attribution model can be as large as 50%. Sensitivity analysis further shows that non-linear effects associated with changing surface resistance for LULCC scenarios with large perturbations (e.g., deforestation and urbanization) are particularly strong.

Under this scenario one-class classification algorithms could be a more efficient alternative. Currently there are several algorithms that can fulfil this task, with MaxEnt being one of the most promising. However, there is scarce information regarding parametrization for performing land-cover classification using MaxEnt. In this study we aimed to understand how MaxEnt parameterization affects the classification accuracy of four different land-covers (i.e., built-up, irrigated grass, evergreen trees and deciduous trees) in the city of Santiago de Chile. We also evaluated if MaxEnt manual parameterization outperforms classification results obtained when using MaxEnt default parameters setting. To accomplish our objectives, we generated a set of 25,344 classification maps (i.e., 6,336 for each assessed landcover), which are based on all the potential combination of 12 different classes of features restrictions, four regularization multipliers, four different sample sizes, three training/testing proportions, and 11 thresholds for generating the binary maps. Our results showed that with a good parameterization, MaxEnt can effectively classify different land covers with kappa values ranging from 0.68 for deciduous trees to 0.89 for irrigated grass. However, the accuracy of classification results is highly influenced by the type of land-cover being classified. Simpler models produced good classification outcomes for homogenous land-covers, but not for heterogeneous covers, where complex models provided better outcomes. In general, manual parameterization improves the accuracy of classification results, but this improvement will depend on the threshold used to generate the binary map. In fact, threshold selection showed to be the most relevant factor impacting the accuracy of the four land-cover classification. The number of sampling points for training the model also has a positive effect on classification results. However, this effect followed a logarithmic distribution, showing an improvement of kappa values when increasing the sampling from 40 to 60 points, but showing only a marginal effect if more than 60 sampling points are used. In light of these results, we suggest testing different parametrization and thresholds until satisfactory kappa or other accuracy metrics values are achieved. Our results highlight the huge potential that MaxEnt has a as a tool for one-class classification, but a good understanding of the software settings and model parameterization is needed to obtain reliable results.",Urban vegetation,Remote sensing,Land-use,Model tuning,Maximum entropy,Land-cover,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study seeks to comprehend how the evolving climate and LULC patterns are impacting the hydrology of the Mahanadi Reservoir catchment. A semi-distributed Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was utilized to simulate various water balance elements. Twelve distinct scenarios were developed by combining three different climatic data periods (1985-1996, 1997-2008, and 2009-2020) with four sets of land use maps (1985, 1995, 2005, and 2014). The SWAT model demonstrated strong performance in simulating monthly stream flows throughout the calibration and validation phases. The study reveals that changes in LULC have a distinct effect on the environment. Specifically, the changes in LULC lead to heightened streamflow and reduced evapotranspiration (ET). These changes are mainly attributed to amplified urbanization and the diminished presence of water bodies, forest cover, and barren land within the Mahanadi Reservoir catchment. The combined impact of climate change and LULC shifts reveals complex interactions. Therefore, the present study offers an understanding of how changes in climate and land use over the past few decades have influenced the hydrological behavior of the Mahanadi Reservoir catchment in Chhattisgarh. The findings of this study have the potential to offer advantages to governmental bodies, policymakers, water resource engineers, and planners seeking effective strategies for water resource management.

We also find that PAs maintain larger carbon stocks and continue sequestering carbon in recent years (2001-2005), but at a lower rate due to increased heterotrophic respiration as well as lower productivity associated to aging ecosystems.

In contrast, built-up areas increased the most, from 10.4% (7895 ha) in 1989 to 11.9% (9048 ha) in 2019. Water bodies also increased, from 0.88% (676 ha) in 1989 to 0.94% (715 ha) in 2019. In the KWR, cropland and gardens increased the most, from 2.14% (1647 ha) in 1989 to 3.4% (2606 ha) in 2019. Built-up areas also increased, from 0.05% (45 ha) in 1989 to 0.09% (75 ha) in 2019. Water bodies increased from 0.69% (538 ha) in 1989 to 0.71% (552 ha) in 2019. Finally, high-density pasture decreased the most, from 29.4% (22,603 ha) in 1989 to 28.5% (21,955 ha) in 2019. At the same time, the high and very high ER classes increased, more so in the JPA compared to the KWR. Finally, considering both LULC and ER changes, the Delphi method demonstrated that the greatest impacts occurred in the JPA. Various illegal economic and physical activities have created LULC changes and caused extensive destruction of ecosystems, posing a high ER in the study areas. The intensity of ER differs between the two PAs because of the varying distance from the metropolis, varying degrees of human activities, LULC changes, along with differences in legal restrictions of use. Aligned with the management plans of these areas, our research shows that it is necessary to develop land only within the designated zones to minimize the amount of ER. Various models of LULC changes have been presented, and a comparison of these models relating to the methodology and model effectiveness can help increase their accuracy and power of interpretation.",land use,land cover (LULC) changes,ecological risk (ER) assessment,integrated system management,Delphi method,protected areas,Iran,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, the changing climate variables, like rainfall, acted and will act on a human-modified landscape. In this work, we analyze the role of rainfall variation and land use/cover change in the occurrence of landslides in Calabria in the period 1921-2010. Combining rainfall and landslide information, we reconstruct and analyze a catalogue of 1466 rainfall events with landslides (i.e., the occurrence of one or more landslide during or immediately after a rainfall event). To investigate the impact of land use/cover changes in the occurrence of landslides, we consider the ""Land Use Map"" made by the Italian National Research Council and the Italian Touring Club in 1956, and the ""CORINE Land Cover"" map released in 2000. Since our landslide catalogue is at municipality scale (i.e., for each landslide we known the municipality in which it occurred), we attribute a prevailing land use/cover class to each of the 409 municipalities of Calabria. We split the catalogue in two subsets (1921-1965 and 1966-2010) and correlate the landslides occurred in the first period to the 1956 land use and the landslides occurred in the second period to the 2000 land cover. We find that: (i) the geographical and the temporal distributions of rainfall-induced landslides have changed in the observation period; (ii) land use/cover in Calabria has changed between the two periods, with a huge decrease of arable land and an increase of heterogeneous agricultural areas and forests; (iii) in both periods, most of the landslides occurred in areas characterized by forests and arable land; (iv) in the second period, there was an increase (decrease) of landslides occurred in agricultural areas (arable land).",Landslide,Rainfall,Climate change,Land use,Land cover,Change,Calabria,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ADVANCING CULTURE OF LIVING WITH LANDSLIDES, VOL 5: LANDSLIDES IN DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS",Italy,,,,,,,,,,,

In loess hilly and gully regions, to prevent soil loss and achieve better ecological environments, soil conservation measures have been taken during the past decades. The main objective of this study is to quantify the spatio-temporal variability of land use/cover change spatial patterns and make preliminary estimation of the role of human activity in the environmental change in Xihe watershed, Gansu Province, China. To achieve this objective, the methodology was developed in two different aspects, that is, (1) analysis of change patterns by binary image of change trajectories overlaid with different natural geographic factors, in which Relative Change Intensity (RCI) metric was established and used to make comparisons, and (2) analysis based on pattern metrics of main trajectories in the study area. Multi-source and multi-temporal Remote Sensing (RS) images (including Landsat ETM+ (30 June 2001), SPOT imagery (21 November 2003 and 5 May 2008) and CBERS02 CCD (5 June 2006)) were used due to the constraints of the availability of remotely sensed data. First, they were used to extract land use/cover types of each time node by object-oriented classification method. Classification results were then utilized in the trajectory analysis of land use/cover changes through the given four time nodes. Trajectories at every pixel were acquired to trace the history of land use/cover change for every location in the study area. Landscape metrics of trajectories were then analyzed to detect the change characteristics in time and space through the given time series. Analysis showed that most land use/cover changes were caused by human activities, most of which, under the direction of local government, had mainly led to virtuous change on the ecological environments. While, on the contrary, about one quarter of human-induced changes were vicious ones. Analysis through overlaying binary image of change trajectories with natural factors can efficiently show the spatio-temporal distribution characteristics of land use/cover change patterns. It is found that in the study area RCI of land use/cover changes is related to the distance to the river line. And there is a certain correlation between RCI and slope grades. However, no obvious correlation exists between RCI and aspect grades. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Future impacts, under one or multiple future scenarios, can be estimated with the use of LULC projections from land use change models. Our aim is to quantify LULC change impacts on carbon stocks and biodiversity in the West Kutai and Mahakam Ulu districts in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Hereto, we used LULC data from 1990 to 2009 and land use change model projections up to 2030 under four contrasting LULC change scenarios differing along two axes: land development (limited vs. unlimited) and zoning (restricted vs. unrestricted), explicitly considering the uncertainties in the land use change model. For the LULC change impact calculations, three quantitative indicators were evaluated: aboveground biomass (AGB) (for carbon stocks), closed-canopy forest patch size distribution and plant species richness (for biodiversity). Subsequently, we statistically assessed whether the motivation to opt for a specific scenario was conclusive given the uncertainty in the indicator values. We found that under the limited development scenarios the projected AGB decrease towards 2030 was insignificant, plant species richness was projected to decrease significantly by similar to 3%, and closed-canopy forest patches mainly of 100-1000 ha were projected to become fragmented. The effect of zoning was insignificant under these scenarios. The difference between the limited and unlimited development scenarios was significant, with the projected impacts under the unlimited development scenarios being much higher: AGB was projected to decrease 4-30%, plant species richness 10-40%, and the closed-canopy forest was projected to completely loose its typical patch size distribution. The effect of zoning on these scenarios was positive and significant. These results suggest that the most sustainable pathway for East Kalimantan, given our indicators, would be to limit land development, mainly large-scale cash-crop cultivation. If land development cannot be limited, the implementation of restricted development zones is advised. The methodologic novelty of our approach is that we propagate uncertainties from a land use change model to the impact assessment and test the significance of differences between future scenarios, in other words we test if a potential policy instrument has a significant (positive) effect on the studied indicators and may thus be worth implementing.",Land use and land cover change,Modelling,Uncertainty,Scenarios,Impact assessment,Borneo,,"Faaij, Andre P.

The relationship between groundwater quality and LULC patterns were also explored. Piper diagram, Gibbs diagram, and self-organizing map (SOM) were used to investigate the hydrogeochemistry and groundwater quality in the city. Remote sensing image data generated by Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 satellites in 2005, 2010, and 2015 were used to extract the LULC patterns of Xi'an City in those three years. These data were used to determine the LULC conversion between 2005 and 2010, and between 2010 and 2015. Entropy weighted water quality index (EWQI), curved streamline searchlight model (CS-SLM), and multiple linear regression analysis were used to relate groundwater quality to the LULC patterns of Xi'an City in the three years. The Piper diagram indicated that groundwater in Xi'an City was mainly characterized as HCO3-Na type and/or HCO3-Ca center dot Mg type. The Gibbs diagram indicated that the dominant evolution of hydrogeochemistry was through rock weathering and water-rock interactions. SOM classified the groundwater into eight clusters, and revealed different spatiotemporal patterns of water quality parameters. The LULC classification indicated that the urban land in Xi'an City has expanded by more than 160%, while forest and agricultural land areas have reduced by 52.54% and 83.08%, respectively, from 2005 to 2015. Indicated by the coefficient of multiple linear regression of EWQI and the percentages of LULC types in CS-SLM for the wells, urban land, agricultural land, and industrial land had negative effects on groundwater quality, while the forest positively impacted the groundwater quality in the same period.

The present study aims to assess the LULC changes and their impact on LST over Mardan and Charsadda districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Pakistan, in the period from 1990 to 2019. Landsat satellite (TM& ETM +) datasets in the period from 1990 to 2010 and Sentinel-2 images from 2016 to 2019 were used in this study. All the datasets were pre-processed and the LULC types were classified by maximum likelihood classification algorithm. The vegetation degradation was computed from normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the LST was derived based on the LULC changes. The results showed that the overall accuracy of LULC classification was 87.84%. Dramatic LULC changes were observed during the last three decades, where the vegetation degradation area was decreased from 1307.8 (59.27%) to 1147.6 km(2) (52.1%) and the barren land area increased from 816.6 (37.07%) to 961.4 km(2) (42.64%). Similarly, the built-up area has also increased from 57.2 (2.5%) to 104.3 km(2) (4.73%) in the years 1990 and 2019, respectively. These variations in LULC types have significantly influenced the LST from 1990 to 2019; specifically, the LST of built-up area, barren land, and vegetation cover increased from 20.1 to 32.1 degrees C, 21.5 to 35.5 degrees C, and 17.1 to 28.2 degrees C, respectively. The regression line plotted defines that the LST has a negative correlation with NDVI and a positive correlation with normalized difference of built-up index (NDBI). In particular, the vegetation and land covers dramatically transformed to barren land and/or to urban development over the study area in the period from 1990 to2019, which has severely affected the LST and the natural resources of the study area.

To examine the regional impacts of land surface types on surface air temperature and precipitation change integrating regional topography, we used the observation minus reanalysis (OMR) method. Precipitation series were found to be homogeneous. Comparison of GHCN and our analysis on adjusted temperatures indicated that the resulting climate trends varied slightly from dataset to dataset. OMR trends associated with surface vegetation types revealed a strong surface warming response to land barrenness and weak warming response to land greenness. A total of 81.1 % of the surface warming over vegetation index areas (0-0.2) was attributed to surface vegetation type change and regional topography. The contribution of surface vegetation type change decreases as land cover greenness increases. The OMR precipitation trend has a weak dependence on surface vegetation type change.

This is partly due to a growing number of operational sensor systems for both scientific and commercial use and also because of an increasing demand for land-cover information relevant to global environmental issues and international policy instruments (e.g. the Kyoto protocol). Within this context, the present article discusses the state of the art of data processing and analysis for the assessment of broad scale land-cover and land-cover change in tropical regions. Current global scale land-cover maps are compared with regional satellite mapping products (Landsat/ETM+) for a test region in the humid tropics of Central Sulawesi, Indonesia.The paper suggests the land cover classification system (LCCS) to be used as the conceptual basis for future land-cover analysis in Sulawesi because it delivers a consistent and comparable scale-independent class structure for satellite image-based land-cover mapping and monitoring. The results of the comparative analysis of land-cover and land-cover change document the inhomogeneity, inconsistency and hence high uncertainty of existing estimates. The outcome of the harmonized and generalized land-cover products for two base years (1992 and 2000) indicates considerable disagreements in area estimates and spatial distributions of land-cover classes for a single date that in some cases exceed the detectable changes between years.Future work aiming at a long-scale operational land-cover mapping of tropical environments has to account for (a) a further harmonization of existing and planned land-cover definitions and products, (b) the regional validation of products and (c) the implementation of a multi-level standardized technical and conceptual classification workflow for ecosystem mapping and monitoring in tropical regions.",land-cover,change detection,tropical ecosystems,MODIS,AVHRR,VEGETATION,LCCS,"Ardiansyah, Muhammad",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"STABILITY OF TROPICAL RAINFOREST MARGINS: LINKING ECOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONSTRAINTS OF LAND USE AND CONSERVATION",GLC2000,,,,,,,,,,,

Some degree of the spatial variability of deforestation has also been captured by the simulation. Applying the model to a ''Conventional Wisdom'' scenario showed that future trends of land conversions could be strikingly different on different continents even though a consistent scenario (IS92a from the IPCC) was used for assumptions about economic growth and population.

However, model predictions are associated with uncertainties stemming from sources such as model input data. As an important input to most watershed models, land use/cover (LULC) data can affect hydrological predictions and influence the interpretation of modeling results. In addition, it has been shown that the use of soft data will further ensure the quality of modeling results to be closer to watershed behavior. In this study, the ecologically relevant flows (ERFs) are the primary soft data to be considered as a part of the modeling processes. This study aims to evaluate the impacts of LULC input data on the hydrological responses of the rapidly urbanizing Upper Cahaba River watershed (UCRW) located in Alabama, USA. Two sources of LULC data, i.e., National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and Digitized Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images, were used as input in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model for the years 1992 and 2011 using meteorological data from 1988 to 2013. The model was calibrated at the watershed outlet against daily streamflow from 1988 to 1993 using the 1992 LULC data and validated for the 2008-2013 period using the 2011 LULC datasets. The results show that the models achieved similar performances with both LULC datasets during the calibration and validation periods according to commonly used statistical rating metrics such as Nash Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), coefficient of determination (R-2), and model percent bias (PBIAS). However, LULC input information had substantial impacts on simulated ERFs such as mean monthly streamflow, maximum and minimum flows of different durations, and low flow regimes. This study demonstrates that watershed models based on different sources of LULC and applied under different LULC temporal conditions can achieve equally good performances in predicting streamflow. However, substantial differences might exist in predicted hydrological regimes and ERF metrics depending on the sources of LULC data and the LULC year considered. Our results reveal that LULC data can significantly impact the simulated flow regimes of the UCRW with underlaying influences on the predicted biotic and abiotic structures of aquatic and riparian habitats.",land use/cover change,SWAT,NLCD,uncertainty,flow regimes,soft data,land use/cover input data,"Yen, Haw",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,equifinality,,,,,,,,,,,

Such environments reflect the economic conditions and quality of life of the individual country. Urbanization is generally influenced by national laws, plans, and policies and by power, politics, and governance in many developing countries. Remote sensing tools play a vital role in monitoring LULC change and measuring the rate of urbanization at both the local and global levels.

Here we take a modeling approach that involves a full carbon accounting to include the effect of previous human-induced land use changes and management during a period of abiotic changes to the environment since the 1700s. The goal is to show how land use and land cover change has affected carbon loss in the context of other environmental changes like climate, elevated CO2, and nitrogen deposition that tend to enhance growth. Here we show that land use and land cover change has led to the loss of carbon since 1700 (42 PgC), while growth enhancements since the start of the 20th century have only partially countered this loss (1.8 PgC). Fertilized croplands are the largest carbon sink in the first decade of the 21st century (477 TgC/year), followed by forests (266 TgC/year) and grazing pastures (223 TgC/year), if not accounting for land use conversion fluxes, product decomposition, and livestock respiration (i.e., net ecosystem productivity).

However, understanding terrestrial carbon uptake and the LUCC contribution remains unclear because of complex interactions with other drivers (particularly climate change). By proposing an innovative approach of ""trajectory analysis"", this study aimed to isolate the LUCC contribution to terrestrial carbon uptake over different scales. Methodologically, global land was first divided into sub-regions of land transformations and stable land trajectories. Then, the carbon uptake change in the stable land trajectory was taken as a synthetic influence of climate change, which was used as a reference to isolate the carbon uptake alternation generated from the LUCC contribution in the land transformation trajec-tories. Finally, future LUCC and the terrestrial carbon uptake response were predicted under different devel-opment pathways. The results showed the global mean net ecosystem production (NEP) was 27.44 & PLUSMN; 36.51 g C m-2 yr-1 in the past two decades (2001-2019), generating 3.15 & PLUSMN; 0.88 Pg C yr -1 of the total terrestrial carbon uptake.

Climate change acted as the dominant factor for the trends at the global scale, which contributed 21.26 g C m- 2 yr -1 and 1.59 Pg C yr -1 of the mean NEP and total carbon uptake changes in the stable land trajectories (94.30 million km2 that covered 63.29 % of the global land area), and the historical LUCC contributed-6.30 g C m- 2 yr -1 (-40.85 %) and -0.046 Pg C yr -1 (-57.50 %) of the mean NEP and the total carbon uptake change in the land transformation trajectories (6.64 million km2 that covered 4.46 % of the global land area), respectively. The maximum LUCC contribution (-61.85 g C m- 2 yr-1) to the mean NEP occurred in the land transformations from evergreen needleleaf forests to woody savannas, while the maximum contribution (-0.034 Pg C y-1) to total carbon uptake was in the deforested regions from evergreen broadleaf forests to woody savannas. Eight SSP-RCP scenarios predictions demonstrated that future terrestrial carbon uptake would increase by an average of 0.015 Pg C yr-1 in 2100 due to global afforestation. SSP4-3.4 and SSP5-3.4 had the greatest potential for increasing carbon uptake, which is expected to reach a maximum increase (0.045 Pg C yr -1) in 2100. In contrast, the minimum terrestrial carbon uptake would occur in SSP5-8.5, which had the highest CO2 emissions. In conclusion, although relatively limited at the global scale, LUCC (particularly forest change) exerted an unneglectable role on terrestrial carbon uptake in land transformation regions. The results of this study will help to clarify terrestrial carbon uptake dynamics and provide a basis for carbon neutral and climatic adaptation.",Terrestrial carbon uptake,Net ecosystem production (NEP),Climate change,Land use and cover change (LUCC),Global,,,"Yang, Zhuoling","Wang, Shihan","Wang, Wei",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relationship between UHI spatiotemporal fluctuations and LULC classes was also evaluated. The composition of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical Landsat 8 OLI images were used to extract the LU/LC type of the study area with higher accuracy for all seasons. Random forest supervised classifier was used to classify Kabul city into four different LU/LC classes (vegetation, water body, built-up, and bare land). Landsat 8 thermal bands were used to derive land surface temperature (LST) change patterns. The outputs revealed that the UHIs created in Kabul city have distinct causes depending on the type of LU/LC classes. The mean land surface temperature of the four LU/LC classes in different seasons demonstrated that the distribution mode of UHIs in the city was in line with the type of LU/LC. Based on overall assessments, the results revealed that nine districts in Kabul city (D-19, D-15, D-21, D-16, D-20, D-17, D-6, D-9, and D-1) are highly affected by urban heat islands. The UHIaffected regions in Kabul city, mostly consist of industrial parks, factories, the airport, industrial complexes, brick kilns, high volume of daily traffic congestion, densely populated, crush plant stations, and residential settlements. To validate the results, daytime and nighttime MODIS LST maps were generated. The daytime LST map similarly demonstrated that the spatial distribution of UHIs is related to the types of LU/LC. On the other hand, the results from nighttime LST maps revealed that nighttime heat islands are more intense than daytime heat islands, with the main concentrations of UHIs spreading towards the most populated areas in the central and eastern portion of Kabul city. This is due to the absorption of solar radiation throughout the day and emission during the nighttime. Remote sensing techniques were shown to be productive and economic, particularly in terms of minimizing the time for the evaluation of urban heat island variations based on the relationship between land surface temperature and LU/LC changes. Precise and updated remote sensing assessments of UHIs will pave the way for urban planners and land management organizations in addressing challenges related to the phenomenon.",Land Surface Temperature (LST),Urban Heat Island (UHI),Land use,cover,Sentinel-1,,,"Ahmadi, Karimullah",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In comparison with the original land surface data in the Community Land Model version 4 (ORG), the new data features notable land use and land cover change (LULCC) with increased forests over northeastern Asia and Alaska by decreasing shrublands and grasslands. Overestimated bare land cover over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and the Rocky Mountains in the ORG are corrected with the replacements by grasslands and shrublands respectively in the new data. The model simulation results show that with the introduction of the ESA CCI-LC, the simulated surface albedo, surface net radiation flux, sensible and latent heat fluxes are relatively improved over the regions where significant LULCC exists, such as northeastern Asia, Alaska, the TP, and Australia. Surface air temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric circulation are improved in boreal winter but degraded in summer. The winter warming over northeastern Asia results from increased longwave downwelling flux and adiabatic heating while the notable winter cooling over Alaska is attributed to strong cold advection followed by reduced longwave downwelling flux. LULCC alters precipitation by influencing water vapor content. In winter, LULCC affects atmospheric circulation via modulating baroclinicity while in summer, it influences land-sea thermal contrast, thus affecting the intensity of East Asian summer monsoon.

Few studies have examined the impacts of both expected precipitation and land use changes on vegetation structure in the future, despite their likely severity. Here, we modeled tree cover in sub-Saharan Africa, as a proxy for vegetation structure and land cover change, using climatic, edaphic, and anthropic data (R-2=0.97). Projected tree cover for the year 2070, simulated using scenarios that include climate and land use projections, generally decreased, both in forest and savanna, although the directionality of changes varied locally. The main driver of tree cover changes was land use change; the effects of precipitation change were minor by comparison. Interestingly, carbon emissions mitigation via increasing biofuels production resulted in decreases in tree cover, more severe than scenarios with more intense precipitation change, especially within savannas. Evaluation of tree cover change against protected area extent at the WWF Ecoregion scale suggested areas of high biodiversity and ecosystem services concern. Those forests most vulnerable to large decreases in tree cover were also highly protected, potentially buffering the effects of global change. Meanwhile, savannas, especially where they immediately bordered forests (e.g. West and Central Africa), were characterized by a dearth of protected areas, making them highly vulnerable. Savanna must become an explicit policy priority in the face of climate and land use change if conservation and livelihoods are to remain viable into the next century.",habitat loss,land use,protected areas,rainfall,tree cover,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, processing of these massive data repositories has focused mostly on tracing forest growth and loss across very large areas within pre-defined study periods. Despite these very considerable advances, there is a need for methodology that could allow analysts to use their own specific land-cover categories of interest, and update existing land-cover classifications either forward or backward to a desired point in time. Here we demonstrate an algorithm (Bayesian Updating of Land-Cover, or BULC) developed for the continuous updating of land-cover classifications through time in large data sets. The BULC algorithm is designed to permit users to build new classifications or update existing classifications based on long streams of imagery, but with minimal storage and memory requirements. The algorithm ingests a sequence of classified land-cover data for a user-specified set of detectable classes, and maintains a continually updated estimate of land-cover probabilities and the most probable class at all time points along the sequence. We tested this algorithm in central Quebec with Landsat 8 imagery for summer 2013, when a series of large fires erupted and burned through forests. In this very dynamic setting, many of the summer's images were contaminated by ordinary standards, yet parts of the region could be seen through the clouds, smoke, and haze of each image. Across 11 dates of widely varying quality, BULC tracked the fires, ignored contaminated image information, and mapped fire borders consistently throughout the summer, autumn, and subsequent winter and spring. Building on images having a median accuracy of 78% and 8% NoData, the BULC algorithm created 11 sequenced land-cover maps each having more than 90% overall accuracy and covering the entire study area. BULC's classifications mapped each of the land-cover categories with user's and producer's accuracies that compared well to the best individual images used as input, while accurately tracking land-cover change that occurred between those infrequent clear images. As we leave remote sensing's data-poor era and enter a period with many images of Earth's surface supplied by multiple sensors over a short period of time, the BULC algorithm may help to sift through images of varying quality to extract the most useful information for mapping time series of land-cover classifications.

However, few spatially explicit process models can efficiently incorporate the influence of land cover change and carbon lateral movement at regional scales or high spatial resolution. This study uses the Land Use and Carbon Scenario Simulator (LUCAS) to demonstrate the development of a fast ecosystem model that not only considers the basic carbon cycle but also incorporates the impact of land cover change, soil erosion, and soil deposition. As input to the LUCAS modeling framework, we used the integrated biosphere simulator (IBIS) to simulate a non-spatial reference carbon cycling scenario without considering land cover change for the Nisqually River watershed in the northwestern United States. We then used the Land Change Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection (LCMAP) remotely sensed 30-m sequential land cover data to generate annual land change history for the Nisqually River area from 1985 to 2017 and used the Unit Stream Powered Erosion and Deposition model (USPED) to estimate annual soil carbon lateral movement. Finally, we combined the annual carbon outputs from IBIS, the land change history from LCMAP, and the soil erosion and deposition from USPED within the LUCAS simulation framework. Results showed that from 1985 to 2017, along with the dynamic land cover changes, total ecosystem biomass carbon increased from 11.4 to 18.6 TgC, mainly due to forest growth. Total ecosystem soil carbon declined from 31.7 to 29.7 TgC, but the overall loss in soil carbon was not uniform across land cover types.

The large decline in forest cover was prominent in the two regions with the highest percent of overall change, the Marine West Coast Forests (24.5% of the region experienced a change in at least one time period) and the Eastern Temperate Forests (11.4% of the region with at least one change). Agriculture declined by approximately 90,000 km(2) with the largest annual net loss of 12,000 km(2) yr(-1) occurring between 1986 and 1992. Developed area increased by 33% and with the rate of conversion to developed accelerating rate over time. The time interval with the highest annual rate of change of 47,000 km(2) yr(-1) (0.6% per year) was 1986-1992. This national synthesis documents a spatially and temporally dynamic era of land change between 1973 and 2000. These results quantify land change based on a nationally consistent monitoring protocol and contribute fundamental estimates critical to developing understanding of the causes and consequences of land change in the conterminous United States.

This study utilizes the land use data of Jiangsu Province for the years 2000, 2010, and 2020, applying the FLUS model to investigate the driving force behind land expansion and to simulate a prediction for the land use of 2030. By integrating the InVEST model and landscape pattern indices, this study analyzes the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of habitat quality in Jiangsu Province and uses geographical detector analysis to examine the synergistic effects of influencing factors. The results indicate that, from 2000 to 2020, habitat degradation in Jiangsu Province progressively increased, with the spatial distribution of degradation levels showing a gradual change. Under the ecological protection scenario in 2030, habitat fragmentation was alleviated. Conversely, under the economic development scenario, habitat quality further deteriorated, resulting in the largest area of low-quality regions. Minimal changes occurred under the natural development scenario. (2) The landscape indices in Jiangsu Province experienced significant changes from 2000 to 2020. The continuous expansion of urban land into other land use types led to a trend of fragmentation, with a clear increasing trend in dispersion, sprawl, and Shannon's diversity index, accompanied by a decrease in cohesion. (3) The dominant interacting factors affecting habitat quality were combinations of socioeconomic factors with other factors, indicating that the economy largely determines the spatial distribution pattern of habitat quality.

In this study, the terrain steepness index (TSI) was initially put forward to study the effect of the DEM on the classification accuracy of the land use/cover. Seven areas with different terrain were taken as the studied areas and the classification and regression tree was utilized to derive thematic land use/cover maps. It indicated that the DEM had an impact on classification accuracy in a certain TSI extent. The developed quadratic model accurately described the correlation between the DEM and the TSI. Based on the model, the DEM with 30 m resolution had a positive impact on the classification accuracy, when the TSI varies from 9.106 to 34.014.

The changes in land cover largely affect the terrestrial ecosystem, thus information on land cover is important for understanding the ecological environment. Quantification of land cover in urban areas is challenging due to their diversified activities and large spatial and temporal variations. To improve urban land cover classification and mapping, this study presents three new spectral indices and an automated approach to classifying four major urban land types: impervious, bare land, vegetation, and water. A modified normalized difference bare-land index (MNDBI) is proposed to enhance the separation of impervious and bare land. A tasseled cap water and vegetation index (TCWVI) is proposed to enhance the detection of vegetation and water areas. A shadow index (ShDI) is proposed to further improve water detection by separating water from shadows. An approach for optimizing the thresholds of the new indices is also developed. Finally, the optimized thresholds are used to classify land covers using a decision tree algorithm. Using Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data from two study sites (Hong Kong and Dhaka City, Bangladesh) with different urban characteristics, the proposed approach is systematically evaluated. Spectral separability analysis of the new indices is performed and compared with other common indices. The urban land cover classifications achieved by the proposed approach are compared with those of the classic support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The proposed approach achieves an overall classification accuracy of 94-96%, which is superior to the accuracy of the SVM algorithm.",terrestrial ecosystem,land cover,classification,spectral indices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Southern France is particularly well-suited to this type of study as a result of previous programmes of intensive survey work and excavation in advance of large-scale construction. These make it possible to calibrate the larger scale occupation patterns in the light of the visibility issues created by the burial of archaeological sites beneath alluvial sediments. For purposes of analysis, the region was divided into three biogeographical zones (BGZ), going from the Mediterranean coast to the middle Rhone valley (MRV). All the different population proxies in a given zone show broadly similar patterns of fluctuation, though with varying levels of resolution. The long-term patterns in the different zones all show significant differences from the overall regional pattern, but this is especially the case for the non-Mediterranean middle Rhone area. Cluster analysis of pollen samples has been carried out to identify the main regional land cover types through the Holocene, which are increasingly dominated by open types over time. A variety of other pollen indicators show evidence of increasing human impact through time. Measures of human impact correlate strongly with the population proxies. A series of thresholds are identified in the population-human impact trajectory that are related to other changes in the cultural sequence. The lack of independent climate data for the region means that its impact cannot currently be assessed with confidence.

If water pollution is to be controlled and ultimately eliminated, it is essential to understand how human activities affect surface water quality. A recently developed technique using the Bayesian hierarchical linear regression model revealed the effects of land use and land cover (LULC) on stream water quality at a watershed scale. Six LULC categories combined with watershed characteristics, including size, slope, and permeability were the variables that were studied. The pollutants of concern were nutrient concentrations of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP), common pollutants found in eutrophication. The monthly monitoring data at 41 sites in the Xitiaoxi Watershed, China during 2009-2010 were used for model demonstration. The results showed that the relationships between LULC and stream water quality are so complicated that the effects are varied over large areas. The models suggested that urban and agricultural land are important sources of TN and TP concentrations, while rural residential land is one of the major sources of TN. Certain agricultural practices (excessive fertilizer application) result in greater concentrations of nutrients in paddy fields, artificial grasslands, and artificial woodlands. This study suggests that Bayesian hierarchical modeling is a powerful tool for examining the complicated relationships between land use and water quality on different scales, and for developing land use and water management policies.

We propose a novel approach for the simultaneous classification of land cover and land use, where semantic and spatial context is considered. The image sites for land cover and land use classification form a hierarchy consisting of two layers: a land cover layer and a land use layer. We apply Conditional Random Fields (CRF) at both layers. The layers differ with respect to the image entities corresponding to the nodes, the employed features and the classes to be distinguished. In the land cover layer, the nodes represent super-pixels; in the land use layer, the nodes correspond to objects from a geospatial database. Both CRFs model spatial dependencies between neighbouring image sites. The complex semantic relations between land cover and land use are integrated in the classification process by using contextual features. We propose a new iterative inference procedure for the simultaneous classification of land cover and land use, in which the two classification tasks mutually influence each other. This helps to improve the classification accuracy for certain classes. The main idea of this approach is that semantic context helps to refine the class predictions, which, in turn, leads to more expressive context information. Thus, potentially wrong decisions can be reversed at later stages. The approach is designed for input data based on aerial images. Experiments are carried out on a test site to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. We show the effectiveness of the iterative inference procedure and demonstrate that a smaller size of the super-pixels has a positive influence on the classification result.",Contextual classification,Conditional Random Fields,inference procedure,land use classification,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ISPRS GEOSPATIAL WEEK 2015,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, it is crucial to obtain cross-national level LUCC data that represents past and actual LUCC. As urban areas exhibit the most significant dynamics of the changes, accompanied by such processes as urban sprawl, it seems desirable to take into account LUCC information from such areas to acquire national level information. The paper analyses land-use changes (LUCs) in urban areas in Czechia, Poland, and Slovakia. The analysis is based on functional urban area (FUA) data from the European Urban Atlas project for 2006 and 2012. The area of urbanised land grew at the expense of agricultural areas, semi-natural areas, and wetlands over the investigated period in all three countries. The authors determined LUC direction models in urban areas based on the identified land-use change. The proposed LUC direction models for the investigated period and area should offer national level LUC data for such purposes as modelling of future changes or can be the point of reference for planning analyses. The paper proposes the following models: mean model, median model, weighted mean model where the weight is the urbanised to vegetated area ratio, and weighted mean model where the weight is the share of urbanised areas. According to the proposed LUC models, areas considered as urbanised grow in FUAs on average in six years by 5.5900 parts per thousand in Czechia, 7.5936 parts per thousand in Poland, and 4.0769 parts per thousand in Slovakia.

How LUCC has affected water resources across China, however, remains uncertain due to the complexity of LUCC-water interactions. In this study, we used an integrated Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model (DLEM) in conjunction with spatial data of LUCC to estimate the LUCC effects on the magnitude, spatial and temporal variations of evapotranspiration (ET), runoff, and water yield across China. Through comparisons of DLEM results with other model simulations, field observations, and river discharge data, we found that DLEM model can adequately catch the spatial and seasonal patterns of hydrological processes. Our simulation results demonstrate that LUCC led to substantial changes in ET, runoff, and water yield in most of the China's river basins during the 20th Century. The temporal and spatial patterns varied significantly across China. The largest change occurred during the second half century when almost all of the river basins had a decreasing trend in ET and an increasing trend in water yield and runoff, in contrast to the inclinations of ET and declinations of water yield in major river basins, such as Pearl river basin, Yangtze river basin, and Yellow river basin during the first half century. The increased water yield and runoff indicated alleviated water deficiency in China in the late 20th Century, but the increased peak flow might make the runoff difficult to be held by reservoirs. The continuously increasing ET and decreasing water yield in Continental river basin, Southwest river basin, and Songhua and Liaohe river basin implied regional water deficiency. Our study in China indicates that deforestation averagely increased ET by 138 mm/year but decreased water yield by the same amount and that reforestation averagely decreased ET by 422 mm/year since most of deforested land was converted to paddy land or irrigated cropland. In China, cropland-related land transformation is the dominant anthropogenic force affecting water resources during the 20th Century. On national average, cropland expansion was estimated to increase ET by 182 mm/year while cropland abandonment decreased ET by 379 mm/year. Our simulation results indicate that urban sprawl generally decreased ET and increased water yield. Cropland managements (fertilization and irrigation) significantly increased ET by 98 mm/year.

Although hyperspectral data with hundreds of channels provide detailed spectral signatures, the curse of dimensionality might lead to degradation in the land cover classification performance. Moreover, in some practical applications, hyperspectral data may not be available due to cost, data storage, or bandwidth issues, and RGB and near infrared (NIR) could be the only image bands available for land cover classification.

Many studies have employed remote sensing data for assessing LULC changes, however, the investigation of fragmentation probability modeling is still scarce in the existing literature. Thus, the coupling of bagging, random forest (RF), random subspace (RSS), and their ensemble model with multitemporal datasets within the GIS environment makes it possible to model the fragmentation probability of LULC in the Teesta River Basin (TRB), Bangladesh. The number of patch (NP), edge density (ED), largest patch index (LPI), contagion index (%) (CONTAG), aggregation index (AI), perimeter area ratio (P/A ratio), the class area (CA), percentage of landscape (PLAND), patch density (PD), total edge (TE), largest shape index (LSI) and total core area (TCA) were the landscape and class matrices, which were derived from the LULC maps using FRAGSTATS software. The machine learning-based sensitivity models, such as decision tree and support vector machine-based feature selection techniques were implemented to explore the influence of the parameters for fragmentation probability modeling. The results showed that water bodies and barren land were substantially decreased by (6.21%), and (14.59%) respectively while the built-up areas increased by 1.45% from 2010 to 2019. Results revealed that the dominance of the agricultural area has been increased as human interference has been elevated in the TRB. However, twelve class-level and landscape matrices were used to delineate the fragmentation probability zone with the aid of bagging, RF, and RSS algorithms. LULC images and fragmentation probability models were validated using the kappa coefficient and the area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC). The validation outcomes depicted that the three models such as bagging (AUC = 0.864), RF (AUC = 0.819), RSS (AUC = 0.859), and ensemble model (AUC = 0.912) have a good capability to appraise the fragmentation probability, and ensemble model has the highest precision level among three models. Nearly 49% (1789 km2) of the LULC was under a high to very high fragmentation potential zone that requires to be protected with direct measures. The results of sensitivity analysis showed that the number of patches significantly influenced the fragmentation probability model, while the largest patch index was the least sensitive parameter for modeling.",Land-use and land cover,Fragmentation probability,Machine learning algorithms,Land use transitional matrix,Sensitivity analysis,Teesta River basin,,"Ziaul, Sk","Islam, Abu Reza Md Towfiqul","Mallick, Javed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Author investigated what kind of agro-pastoral activities which are both cattle ranching and top five crops (soybean, sugarcane, corn, cotton and rice) that are closely related to land use change on lands experiencing conversion land use change (such as deforestation and the increase in deeply anthropogenically influenced areas) at each municipal district in MT. Then, this study identifies the volume of exports including contribution ratio by municipal districts where land use changed due to agro-pastoral activities. The patterns of vegetation change indicated that cattle ranching, corn, cotton, rice croplands in the northwest, and soybean and sugarcane fields in the central areas are the main contributors to deforestation. It is shown that land use change due to soybean or corn cultivation occurs mainly in the west and the southeast, respectively. Corn cultivation is associated with a greater increase in anthropogenically influenced areas than soybean cultivation. The municipal districts that export each agro-pastoral product with land use change are limited. Exports of soybeans, corn, and cotton in the municipal districts associated with deforestation had increased dramatically after experienced land use change. For example, Sapezal, which has experienced deforestation, was the only municipal district associated with export of corn to only Switzerland. Since 2007, the number of export partners has increased to 56 countries with the export volume increased 2300 times.

A critical review of an existing method for semantic interoperability between land cover classifications is used to motivate and introduce a modified framework based on conceptual spaces and rough fuzzy sets. Land cover categories are defined by a set of defining attributes formally represented as a collection of rough fuzzy membership functions and importance weights. This parameterized representation is used to translate between the US Natural Vegetation Classification Standard and the European CORINE Land Cover system based on evaluations of different aspects of semantic similarity between categories. The results demonstrate that the use of different similarity metrics in a conceptual space, together with the explicit rough fuzzy uncertainty representation, increases the semantic separation between land cover categories.

While land cover is frequently monitored over a large area using satellite data, ground-based reference data is valuable as a comparison point. The NASA-funded GLOBE Observer (GO) program provides volunteer-collected land cover photos tagged with location, date and time, and, in some cases, land cover type. When making a full land cover observation, volunteers take six photos of the site, one facing north, south, east, and west (N-S-E-W), respectively, one pointing straight up to capture canopy and sky, and one pointing down to document ground cover. Together, the photos document a 100-meter square of land. Volunteers may then optionally tag each N-S-E-W photo with the land cover types present.

Using the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model, we examined how different land use and land cover patterns affect regional climate in the agro-pastoral transitional zone of North China, whose environmental and socioeconomic conditions are sensitive to climate change. We parameterized WRF using land use and land cover maps corresponding to 2001 and 2010 conditions, which differ in the representation of four land surface biophysical parameters: vegetation fraction, leaf area index (LAI), albedo, and emissivity. From 2001 to 2010, vegetation fraction and LAI increased in summer, emissivity increased and albedo decreased in winter. Our WRF simulations show that differences in land use and land cover patterns led to widespread reduction in summer temperature with local cooling on the order of 1 degrees C, and extensive increase in winter temperature with local warming exceeding 0.8 degrees C. By contrast, simulations using the default landscape representation, provided by WRF itself, show only minor and random changes in temperature. Model evaluation further reveals that our simulations with appropriate land surface properties improve the performance of the WRF model. Our findings demonstrate that LUCC in Northern China has altered the regional climate over the past decade. The magnitude and spatial patterns of temperature changes quantified by our simulations provide useful information for understanding the impacts of LUCC on climate and for developing mitigation and adaptation strategies in arid and semiarid regions.",land use and land cover change,climate change,agro-pastoral transitional zone,land surface biophysical parameter,landscape pattern,mitigation and adaptation strategy,,"Han, Zhe","Wu, Jianguo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two approaches are used to construct land suitability maps, which are used as inputs in two model applications. The first is an inductive approach that uses regression analysis. The second applies a theoretical, actor decision framework to derive relations deductively using detailed field data. Broadly speaking, this classification coincides with the distinction between empirical and theoretical models and the distinction between deriving process from pattern and pattern from process. The two modelling approaches are illustrated by a scenario analysis for a case study in a municipality in the Philippines. Goodness-of-fit of the deductive approach in predicting current land use is slightly lower compared to the inductive approach. Resulting land use projections from the modelling exercise for the two approaches differ in 15 percent of the cells, which is caused by differences in the specification of the suitability maps. The paper discusses the assumptions underlying the two approaches as well as the implications for the applicability of the models in policy-oriented research. The deductive approach describes processes explicitly and can therefore better handle discontinuities in land use processes. This approach allows the user to evaluate a wide range of scenarios, which can also include new land use types. The inductive approach is easily reproducible by others but cannot guarantee causality. Therefore, the inductive approach is less suitable to handle discontinuities or additional land use types, but is well able to rapidly identify hotspots of land use change. It is concluded that both approaches have their advantages and drawbacks for different purposes. Generally speaking, the inductive approach is applicable in situations with relatively small land use changes, without introduction of new land use types, whereas the deductive approach is more flexible. The choice of modelling approach should therefore be based on the research and policy questions for which it is used. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed to assess the effects of land use and land cover (LULC) on the surface water quality of the Buriganga, Dhaleshwari, Meghna, and Padma river system in Bangladesh. To determine the state of water, water samples were collected from twelve locations in the Buriganga, Dhaleshwari, Meghna, and Padma rivers during the winter season of 2015 and collected samples were analysed for seven water quality indicators: pH, temperature (Temp.), conductivity (Cond.), dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) for assessing water quality (WQ). Additionally, same-period satellite imagery (Landsat-8) was utilised to classify the LULC using the object-based image analysis (OBIA) technique. The overall accuracy assessment and kappa co-efficient value of post-classified images were 92% and 0.89, respectively. In this research, the root mean squared water quality index (RMS-WQI) model was used to determine the WQ status, and satellite imagery was utilised to classify LULC types. Most of the WQs were found within the ECR guideline level for surface water. The RMS-WQI result showed that the ""fair"" status of water quality found in all sampling sites ranges from 66.50 to 79.08, and the water quality is satisfactory. Four types of LULC were categorised in the study area mainly comprised of agricultural land (37.33%), followed by built-up area (24.76%), vegetation (9.5%), and water bodies (28.41%).

Both natural cycles and human activities can be better examined with more accurate sources of land use data with higher spatial resolution. More importantly, it is crucial to consider spatial heterogeneity to simulate future changes in LUCC. In this paper, a modeling strategy (hereinafter referred to as GCAM-CA) that combines a global change assessment model (GCAM) with cellular automata (CA) is proposed. This modeling strategy is designed to sequentially spatialize global LUCCs with 1-km spatial resolution and 5-year temporal resolution from 2010 to 2100. The GCAM model is employed to predict the land use and land cover area demands for 283 world regions, which are divided by intersecting 32 geopolitical and socioeconomic regions and 18 agroecological zones. The spatialization rules of CA is trained separately for each world region to distinguish global land use and land cover types. The different spatialization rules and trends in land use and land cover demand for each of the 283 regions reflect the spatial heterogeneity in the GCAM-CA model. We implement and validate the model for the simulation from 2000 to 2010.

Correspondingly, a simulation of groundwater levels indicates that the overall groundwater level has decreased. Spatially, the Hat Yai district, which exhibited the highest increase in built-up areas, experienced a decrease in groundwater levels. In contrast, the Khuan Niang district, which had the largest increase in perennial areas, demonstrated increased groundwater levels. The findings show that increasing built-up areas decreases the recharge rate, consequently lowering groundwater levels.

Knowledge about the location and type of these changes is essential for environmental modeling and management. Remote sensing data in combination with additional spatial data are recognized as an important source of information to detect these land cover and land use changes.In this paper, we introduce the Dutch multi-date land use database (LGN). Today there are six versions of the LGN database (LGN1-LGN6) based on satellite imagery of respectively 1986, 1992/1994, 1995/1997, 1999/2000, 2003/2004 and 2007/2008.

The resulting inconsistencies for monitoring land use changes and possible solutions are the main themes of this paper.Emerging user requirements, increased data availability and technical improvements lead to methodological differences between the LGN5 and LGN6 Dutch land use database. Monitoring of land use changes by integrating independent spatial datasets results in a mixture of real and methodological changes. A methodology is applied to detect real land use changes for a limited number of land use monitoring classes. The detected real changes have a high probability (almost 95%) that they are real changes. Next to these real changes, differences exist between LGN5 and LGN6, i.e. so-called methodological land use changes, being the result of methodological adaptations over time. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Row_1851,"COCKS, KD","WALKER, BH",,CONTRIBUTION OF SUSTAINABILITY CRITERIA TO SOCIAL PERCEPTIONS OF LAND-USE OPTIONS,,JUL 1994,2,"With relatively minor exceptions, the process of land use change is one of intensification and the narrowing of future land use options.  This has led to community concern for the gradual irrecoverable loss of values associated with less intensive land uses; in particular, concern for the availability and functional capacity of biodiversity, earth materials, water and air.  Concern extends to the functionality of these resources in industrial, amenity and service roles.Such losses, called, inter alia, environmental costs, are never wholly avoidable despite the hopes behind the sustainable development concept.  What is realistically possible is conservative development, meaning that land uses with environmental costs exceeding the economic net benefits would be proscribed as options, through the application of extant and emerging social technologies such as land use zoning, environmental standards and environmental impact assessment.This paper presents some general and some more specific ideas about land uses susceptible to proscription under the conservative development criterion.  Most major land uses stand to be challenged to a degree, particularly in densely populated areas, regions of economic opportunity and/or in regions recognized as having a high conservation value.  Proposals involving a leap in intensification or loss of remnant or old-established land uses will be more liable to assessment for proscription.  Several regions are identified where joint assessment for exclusion across members of a suite of land uses would not be surprising (e.g. the Kimberleys); also some regions and situations where particular land uses stand to be challenged, e.g. irrigated cotton, high country developments and integrated forest harvesting.Rather than list intensification trends at length and predict which challenges to intensification might succeed, this paper discusses the prospects for development of social technologies which evaluate community concerns about the environmental costs of land use intensification.  It is suggested that a blending of the existing procedures of the Resource Assessment Commission for regional resource inventory and evaluation and the existing resource allocation procedures of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority would form a highly defensible core for a new generation of option-defining technologies.

This methodology was applied to both datasets and benchmarking with multiple well-known classifiers (random forest, support vector machines, extra trees, and artificial neural network). As a result, the overall accuracy (OA) for Landsat and Sentinel-2 was reached 77.1% and 96.7%, respectively. The performance of the different types of features was compared using Mexico and Europe images. Interesting results were achieved and some conclusions about using traditional and non-traditional features were found in the LULC classification task.

In India, Western Ghats have the characteristics of rich biodiversity and high biological productivity in India. Valapattanam river is one of the important west flowing river in Western Ghats originating in Kerala and flow to the Arabian Sea. In this study, Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images of 2000 and Operational Land Imager (OLI) images of 2014 are used to analyze the LULC for basin and classified as forest, agriculture, wasteland, grassland, plantation and water bodies and urban area. Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to assess the impact of potential LULC and climate change over the last 14 years (2000-2014) on the discharge with SWAT-CUP for calibration and validation analysis for the Valapattnam River basin. The results revealed that forest area, agriculture land and builtup area were highly dynamic than other classes. During 2000-2014, the catchment area was changed mainly from forest to grassland, grassland to agriculture and agriculture to builtup, and climate change to warmer and drier. The land use change increased the surface runoff but climate change decreased runoff strongly while combined effects of LULC and climate variability decreased runoff. In the catchment area, increased urbanized area and deforestation were the strongest contributors to the increase of runoff at the sub-basinal scale. The results indicated that the SWAT model appears to be useful as a tool to assess the impact of LULC changes and climate variability for the surface hydrologic cycle and to better understand the connection among the surface runoff in the Valapattnam River basin.",Land use land cover,climate variability,surface runoff,SWAT,River basin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 36TH IAHR WORLD CONGRESS,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clustering is the assignment of objects into groups called clusters so that objects from the same cluster are more similar to each other than objects from different clusters. The most basic attribute for clustering of an image is its luminance amplitude for a monochrome image and colour components for a colour image. Since there are more than 16 million colours available in any given image and it is difficult to analyse the image on all of its colours, the likely colours are grouped together by clustering techniques. For that purpose reformed fuzzy C means algorithm has been used. The segmented images are compared using image quality metrics. The image quality metrics used are peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), error image and compression ratio. The time taken for image segmentation is also used as a comparison parameter. The techniques have been applied to classify the land cover.",Land cover,FCM,RFCM,clustering,compression ratio,PSNR,kappa coefficient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Researching the dynamics of land use and land cover (LULC) change is essential for formulating land regulation policies. This paper systematically quantifies changes in LULC in the BTH region from 1980 to 2015, and then deeply analyses the influence of both land regulation policies and spatial development strategies on these changes. The main discoveries of this research are: (1) The primary change in LULC is the conversion from agricultural land to construction land, and the secondary is from agricultural land to ecological land; The eastern and southern parts of the BTH region became the hotspots of LULC changes, while the western and northern parts became the cold spots of LULC changes; The centroids of construction land have been moving towards Beijing and Tianjin since before 1995. However, the direction of movement of the centroids has become divergent since 1995. For ecological land, the centroid moved eastwards before 2000, and then westward after 2010. (2) Land regulation policies have restricted the conversion of agricultural land to construction land, and they have made enormous contributions to the conversion of agricultural land to ecological land in most of the periods, especially from 2010 to 2015, when 3613.35 km2 of agricultural land were converted into ecological land due to a series of land regulation policies. The spatial development strategies have weaken the effect of the construction land agglomerated to the Beijing and Tianjin Municipalities, and promoted the construction land more divergence distribution in the BTH regions. The research results can significantly enhance farmland protection programs, and ecological land planning, which are crucial in the face of the growing demand for construction land.",LULC transfer,Landscape pattern index,Integrated land use change dynamicity,Centroid migration,Land management policies,Spatial development strategies,,"Hu, Haoyu","Feng, Changchun",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this, we mapped the potential species richness using ecological niche models in order to analyse predicted future changes and determined the effect of LULCC on the current and future habitats of Odonata. We also estimated current incidence of deforestation and projected its effect to 2050 using the Dinamica-EGO program. Having predicted the level of deforestation in the year 2050, we then compared current vs. expected species richness and the factors that determine it. First, roads and urban areas turned out to be the most important drivers of LULCC in our analysis. Second, deterioration occurred at all sites, but species richness remained high despite considerable habitat fragmentation. Third, there is likely to be a high species turnover rate (i.e. a high species richness, but composed of different species) even in areas where there are significant changes in the vegetation.

LULC maps of 1989, 1999, 2009 and 2019 were classified using the Random Forest Algorithm in R software and change assessed via intensity analysis. The results revealed that the first decade (1989-1999) showed a faster intensity of change compared to the second (1999-2009) and the third decades (2009-2019). Sparse wooded maquis experienced a major decline (1989-2019) of 15.19% whereas open matorral (+ 14.30), forest (+ 0.15%), and agriculture (+ 1.33%) increased.

Natural attributes and socioeconomic data were used to analyze land use/land cover and its drivers of change. The major modules of the CA-ABM are initialization, migration, assets, land suitability, and land-use change decisions. Empirical estimates of the factors influencing the urban land-use conversion probability were captured using parameters based on a spatial logistic regression (SLR) model. Simultaneously, multicriteria evaluation (MCE) and Markov models were introduced to obtain empirical estimates of the factors affecting the probability of ecological land conversion. An agent-based CA-SLR-MCE-Markov (ABCSMM) land-use conversion model was proposed to explore the impacts of policies on land-use conversion. This model can reproduce observed land-use patterns and provide links for forest transition and urban expansion to land-use decisions and ecosystem services.

Both variants of forest class combinations resulted in a general overestimation of the forest area. The IGBP 2.0 cover performed best with an overall mean absolute error of 13% and a bias of 0%. In a second test, large-area land cover products were tested for accuracy in predicting 13 aggregated land cover types in a spatially explicit manner using CORINE land cover as reference dataset. Due to data inconsistencies, partly insufficient spatial resolution, steep terrain and land use heterogeneity of the European Alps, only partly satisfactory results were obtained.

The land use and land cover (LUC) within Zezere River watershed registered relevant changes in the last decades. These land use and land cover changes (LUCCs) have impacts in water quality, mainly in surface water degradation caused by surface runoff from artificial and agricultural areas, forest fires and burnt areas, and caused by sewage discharges from agroindustry and urban sprawl. In this context, the impact of LUCCs in the quality of surface water of the Zezere watershed is evaluated, considering the changes for different types of LUC and establishing their possible correlations to the most relevant water quality changes. The results indicate that the loss of coniferous forest and the increase of transitional woodland-shrub are related to increased water's pH; while the growth in artificial surfaces and pastures leads mainly to the increase of soluble salts and fecal coliform concentration. These particular findings within the Zezere watershed, show the relevance of addressing water quality impact driven from land use and should therefore be taken into account within the planning process in order to prevent water stress, namely within watersheds integrating drinking water catchments.

The rapid expansion of cultivated land was the result of natural grassland and unused land reclamation. Meanwhile, other land use types changed slightly. The results of PCA analysis indicated that the LUCC change was result of the interaction of human activity (social and economic factors) and natural environmental changes (climate change).

Although the main ecological impacts are likely due to agricultural expansion into natural areas, changes in crop types and production intensification also induce significant ecological changes. We studied the land cover change process in four agricultural valleys (Lluta, Azapa, V & iacute;tor and Camarones) in the Atacama Desert of Chile between 2003 and 2019, divided into four equal periods. Using spatial data and logistic regression, we assessed the driving factors of land cover change. The Azapa valley showed the highest rate of land cover change, reaching 36.4% of netting and greenhouses landscape cover by the end of the study, and 50.4% annual rate of increase during the 2007-2011 period. Intensification was observed as the anti-aphid netting cover expanded mainly in Azapa and in the last four years in V & iacute;tor and Lluta valleys. Most land cover change was related to low slopes and elevation or sites closer to roads or surrounded by already cultivated land, like agriculture expansion on barren soil or native shrubland loss. High population density was significantly correlated with land cover change (p < 0.01). If land cover change into netting continues as observed, it is possible that landscape homogenization occurs in the short term in almost all valleys. Anyway, disentangling how landscape change works and the involved drivers, could be useful to understand landscape simplification in arid lands that are under an agricultural intensification process.",Land cover change,agricultural intensification,landscape homogenization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, thanks to diverse remote sensing platforms, geographers have developed an array of land cover products. However, there are differences between these products due to variations in spatio-temporal resolutions. In this context, assessing the accuracy and consistency of different land cover products is crucial for rationalizing the selection of land cover products to study global or regional environmental changes. In this study, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (XUAR) is taken as the study area, and the consistency and performance (type area deviation, spatial consistency, accuracy assessment, and other indexes) of the five land cover products (GlobeLand30, FROM_GLC30, CLCD, GLC_FCS30, and ESRI) were compared and analyzed. The results of the study show that (1) the GlobeLand30 product has the highest overall accuracy in the study area, with an overall accuracy of 84.06%, followed by ESA with 75.57%, while CLCD has the lowest overall accuracy of 70.05%. (2) The consistency between GlobeLand30 and CLCD (area correlation coefficient of 0.99) was higher than that among the other products. (3) Among the five products, the highest consistency was found for water bodies and permanent snow and ice, followed by bare land. In contrast, the consistency of these five products for grassland and forest was relatively low. (4) The full-consistency area accounts for 49.01% of the total study area. They were mainly distributed in areas with relatively homogeneous land cover types, such as the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, which are dominated by bare land and cropland. In contrast, areas of inconsistency make up only 0.03% and are mostly found in heterogeneous areas, like the transitional zones with mixed land cover types in the Altai Mountains and Tianshan Mountains, or in areas with complex terrain.

The PRMS simulations based on static land cover illustrated consistent differences in simulated streamflow across the island. It was determined that the scale of the analysis makes a difference: large regions with localized areas that have undergone dramatic land cover change may show negligible difference in total streamflow, but streamflow simulations using dynamic land cover parameters for a highly altered subwatershed clearly demonstrate the effects of changing land cover on simulated streamflow. Incorporating dynamic parameterization in these highly altered watersheds can reduce the predictive uncertainty in simulations of streamflow using PRMS.

Currently, deep learning solutions, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), represent the state of the art (SOTA) for CD. However, CNN-based models require substantial amounts of annotated data, which can be both expensive and time-consuming. Conversely, acquiring a large volume of unannotated images is relatively easy. Recently, self-supervised contrastive learning has emerged as a promising method for learning from unannotated images, thereby reducing the need for annotation. However, most existing methods employ random values or ImageNet pre-trained models to initialize their encoders and lack prior knowledge tailored to the demands of CD tasks, thus constraining the performance of CD models. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel feature-differencing-based framework called Barlow Twins for self-supervised pre-training and fine-tuning in CD (BTCD). The proposed approach employs absolute feature differences to directly learn unique representations associated with regions that have changed from unlabeled bi-temporal remote sensing images in a self-supervised manner. Moreover, we introduce invariant prediction loss and change consistency regularization loss to enhance image alignment between bi-temporal images in both the decision and feature space during network training, thereby mitigating the impact of variation in radiation conditions, noise, and imaging viewpoints. We select the improved UNet++ model for fine-tuning self-supervised pre-training models and conduct experiments using two publicly available LULC CD datasets.

In order to gain insight into how land use/cover affects carbon (C) storage in a coastal context, we examined soil and vegetation C and soil nitrogen (N) across land uses near Apalachicola, FL. Forested wetlands had the greatest soil C and N storage, while natural pine forests and pine plantations had the least. In paired plots, urban lawns had significantly greater mineral soil N content compared to urban forest remnants. Total ecosystem C (soil + vegetation) was higher in forested wetlands than all other land uses/covers combined due to the high organic content of those wetland soils. Urban forest remnants and lawns had greater total ecosystem C than natural pine forests and pine plantations, which likely reflects the differential influence of prescribed fire and less frequent anthropogenic disturbances between the rural and urban areas, respectively. Projections of land use change in Franklin County, FL combined with these data suggest that increases in C storage are possible with continued urbanization along the Gulf Coast, if forest remnants are left and lawns are incorporated in built-up areas.

Ecosystem service value sensitivity in response to LUCC was discriminated against using the elasticity model. The study area was dominated by 56.86-60.40 % grassland and 33.11-36.27 % cropland. Grassland and cropland area decreased by 579.75 km2 and 423.87 km2 over the period 2000-2020, while the other areas such as forestland, water area, construction land, and barren land increased by 289.81 km2, 140.77 km2, 489.10 km2, and 83.96 km2, respectively. Land conversion mainly occurred among grassland, cropland, and construction land. Total ESV was 39,665 million yuan in 2020, an increase of 2.25 % compared to 2000. Total ESV of NDs, EPs, EDs, and EEBs increased by 0.34 %, 1.04 %, 2.01 %, and 7.78 %, respectively compared to 2020, while that of CEs decreased by 0.17 %. ESV sensitivity coefficient response to LUCC was 0.43 during 2010-2020, indicating that LULC conversion of 1 % would result in average changes of 0.43 % in ESV. Ecosystem services response to LUCC was not very marked in the HRB. Elevation was the dominant driver of LULC and ESV stratified spatial heterogeneity in the HRB. The effects of elevation on LUCC and ESV should receive more attention in management. Multi-objective optimization and multi-scenario analysis effectively guided land-use planning and decision-making involved in ecosystem uncertainty, complexity, and interaction. The EPs and EEBs may be more suitable for future HRB development.",Land use,cover change (LUCC),Ecosystem service value (ESV),Value equivalent,Land pattern simulation,Spatial heterogeneity detection,Patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS),"Wu, Yuanmei",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To combine the respective advantages of hyperspectral and LiDAR data, this paper proposes an optimal decision fusion method based on adaptive differential evolution, namely ODF-ADE, for urban LULC classification. In the ODF-ADE framework the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and digital surface model (DSM) are extracted to form the feature map. The three different classifiers of the maximum likelihood classifier (MLC), support vector machine (SVM) and multinomial logistic regression (MLR) are used to classify the extracted features. To find the optimal weights for the different classification maps, weighted voting is used to obtain the classification result and the weights of each classification map are optimized by the differential evolution algorithm which uses a self-adaptive strategy to obtain the parameter adaptively. The final classification map is obtained after post-processing based on conditional random fields (CRF).

In this study, the Yungui Plateau in China was used as the study region. Based on annual Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover datasets (MCD12Q1) from 2001 to 2020, using the equivalent coefficient value of ESVs modified for the specific situation of China, and adopting the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic method and Spearman's rank correlation analysis, the study estimated the values of 11 types of ecosystem services, and analyzed the dynamics of LULC and its impact on ESVs from 2001 to 2020. The results showed that the LULC pattern in the Yungui Plateau changed dramatically in the past two decades, with a significant increase in forestland. The total ESVs improved remarkably from 638.10 billion yuan in 2001 to 746.99 billion yuan in 2020, and was mainly affected by forest restoration and the conversion of grassland to forestland and farmland to grassland. The distribution of ESVs shows obvious spatial and temporal heterogeneity; ESV hot spots were mainly distributed in the edge regions, while ESV cold spots were concentrated on the central and eastern of Yungui Plateau, and the decline in total ESVs still existed and displayed an increasing trend caused by farmland expansion and forestland degradation. Thus, we conclude that the LULC changes caused by ecological restoration measures have a significant positive effect on the improvement of the total ESVs in the Yungui Plateau and suggest that declines in ESVs in local areas should be of high concern in future land use planning and management.",Land use,land cover,Ecosystem services value,Equivalent coefficient value,Yungui Plateau,,,"Pan, Chen","Wu, Jin-Long","Ran, Jun","Su, Yuan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, our capacity to reconstruct historical land cover using field data and archived remotely sensed data over large areas and long periods of time is somewhat limited. This study explores the relationship between CORONA texture-a surrogate for actual land cover type and complexity-with spectral vegetation indices and texture variables derived from Landsat MSS under the Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH) such as to reconstruct historical continuous land cover type and complexity. Image texture of CORONA was calculated using a mean occurrence measure while image textures of Landsat MSS were calculated by occurrence and co-occurrence measures. The relationship between these variables was evaluated using correlation and regression techniques. The reconstruction procedure was undertaken through regression kriging. The results showed that, as expected, texture based on the visible bands and corresponding indices indicated larger correlation with CORONA texture, a surrogate of land cover (correlation > 0.65). In terms of prediction, the combination of the first-order mean of band green, second-order measure of tasseled cap brightness, second-order mean of Normalized Visible Index (NVI) and second-order entropy of NIR yielded the best model with respect to Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), r-square, and variance inflation factors (VIF). The regression model was then used in regression kriging to map historical continuous land cover. The resultant maps indicated the type and degree of complexity in land cover. Moreover, the proposed methodology minimized the impacts of topographic shadow in the region. The performance of this approach was compared with two conventional classification methods: hard classifiers and continuous classifiers. In contrast to conventional techniques, the technique could clearly quantify land cover complexity and type. Future applications of CORONA datasets such as this one could include: improved quality of CORONA imagery, studies of the CORONA texture measures for extracting ecological parameters (e.g., species distributions), change detection and super resolution mapping using CORONA and Landsat MSS.",historical land cover,CORONA,Landsat MSS,land cover type,land cover complexity,spectral variation hypothesis (SVH),image texture,"Atkinson, Peter M.","Moore, Nathan","Wang, Ke","He, Shan","Huang, Lingyan","Wu, Jiexia","Shen, Zhangquan","Gan, Muye","Zheng, Xinyu","Su, Yue","Teng, Hongfen","Li, Xiaoyan","Deng, Jinsong","Sun, Yuanyuan","Zhao, Mengzhu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,regression kriging,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, monitoring of the function and condition of lands and their change, along with properly agreed methodologies and freely accessible data, are essential. The Copernicus Land Monitoring Service has produced over 20 years of Corine Land Cover datasets for 39 countries in Europe, which allows continental-wide harmonized and comparable monitoring and accounting of land cover and land use change at a high thematic resolution and in a long time series (2000-2018).

Qomolangma region within the central Himalayas is one of the most sensitive areas to climate change in the world. At the same time, because the Mt. Qomolangma region possesses the most complete natural vertical spectrum in the world, it is also an ideal place to study the vertical structure of alpine land cover. In this study, land cover data for 2010 along with digital elevation model data were used to define three methods for dividing the northern and southern slopes in the Mt. Qomolangma region, i.e., the ridgeline method, the sample transect method, and the sector method. The altitudinal distributions of different land cover types were then investigated for both the northern and southern slopes of the Mt. Qomolangma region by using the above three division methods along with ArcGIS and MATLAB tools. The results indicate that the land cover in the study region was characterized by obviously vertical zonation with the south-six and north-four pattern of vertical spectrum that reflected both the natural vertical structure of vegetation and the effects of human activities. From low to high elevation, the main land cover types were forests, grasslands, sparse vegetation, bare land, and glacier/snow cover. The compositions and distributions of land cover types differed significantly between the northern and southern slopes; the southern slope exhibited more complex land cover distributions with wider elevation ranges than the northern slope. The area proportion of each land cover type also varied with elevation. Accordingly, the vertical distribution patterns of different land cover types on the southern and northern slopes could be divided into four categories, with glaciers/snow cover, sparse vegetation, and grasslands conforming to unimodal distributions. The distribution of bare land followed a unimodal pattern on the southern slope but a bimodal pattern on the northern slope. Finally, the use of different slope division methods produced similar vertical belt structures on the southern slope but different ones on the northern slope. Among the three division methods, the sector method was better to reflect the natural distribution pattern of land cover.",land cover,altitudinal zonation,central Himalayas,Mt,Qomolangma,Mt,Makalu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mt,Cho Oyu,,,,,,,,,,

However, running high-resolution simulations requires a higher-detail mapping of landforms, land use, and land cover. Often, higher-resolution data have limited coverage or availability. This paper presents the feasibility of using CORINE Land Cover (CLC) land use and land cover data and alternative high-resolution global coverage land use/land cover (LULC) data from Copernicus Global Land Service Land Cover Map (CGLS-LC100) V2.0 in high-resolution WRF simulations (100 x 100 m). Global LULC data with a resolution of 100 m are particularly relevant for areas not covered by CLC. This paper presents the method developed by the authors for reclassifying land cover data from CGLS-LC100 to MODIS land use classes with defined parameters in the WRF model and describes the procedure for their implementation into the model. The obtained simulation results of the basic meteorological parameters from the WRF simulation using CLC, CGLS-LC100 and default geographical data from MODIS were compared to observations from 13 meteorological stations in the Warsaw area. The research has indicated noticeable changes in the forecasts of temperature, relative humidity wind speed, and direction after using higher-resolution LULC data. The verification results show a significant difference in weather predictions in terms of CLC and CGLS-LC100 LULC data implementation. Due to the fact that better results were obtained for CLC simulations than for CGLS-LC100, it is suggested that CLC data are first used for simulations in numerical weather prediction models and to use CGLS-LC100 data when the area is outside of CLC coverage.",land use,land cover,CLC,CGLS-LC100,SRTM,GIS,WRF,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,meteorological forecasts,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the country's designation of forest regions as protected areas to conserve their valuable resources, deforestation and forest conversion remained unabated. Fashiakhali Wildlife Sanctuary (FKWS), a protected area in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, and its surrounding forested impact area have experienced considerable changes over the years, yet are deficient in extensive assessment. This study evaluated the land use land cover (LULC) changes in the FKWS impact area over almost 3 decades (1994-2021) using multispectral remotely sensed data. The Landsat images of 1994, 2001, 2010, and 2021 were classified using a maximum likelihood algorithm and analyzed for change detection. The comparative potential of vegetation indices, including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), in forest cover assessment, and the relationship between Land Surface Temperature (LST) and NDVI was also assessed. A significant forest cover loss of around 1117.17 ha (16%) was recorded in the FKWS impact area between 1994 and 2021, with the hugest proportion of 867.78 ha (12.24%) deforested in the first period (1994-2001). Agricultural land also declined by 593.73 ha (8.37%) within the entire period, despite its initial increase of 392.04 ha (5.53%) between 2001 and 2010, being the primary driver of earlier deforestation. However, in the recent decade (2010-2021), settlement expansion of 963.90 ha (13.59%) due to massive human migration in the area contributed to the most remarkable overall land cover change of 1731.51 ha (24.42%). Furthermore, NDVI provided a better and more accurate forest cover assessment than SAVI and was recommended to aid in the quick evaluation and monitoring of the future impacts of agriculture, settlement, and other sorts of land use on the forest cover. In tandem with the widely acknowledged issue of increased temperature due to climate change, an absolute negative correlation was found between the NDVI and LST, confirming the negative impact of climate change on forest loss in the FKWS impact area.",Land use land cover (LULC),Landsat,Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI),Soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI),Land surface temperature (LST),,,"Biswas, Jayanta","Abdullah, S.

The study utilized observed (1985 and 2010) and predicted (2030 and 2050) LULC datasets and ecosystem service value coefficients obtained from publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals. The results indicated that the total ecosystem service value of Abaya-Chamo basin was 12.13 billion USD in 1985 and 12.45 billion USD in 2010. The value is predicted to increase to 12.47 billion USD by the year 2050, which is 2.84% (344.5 million USD) higher than the total value of ecosystem services of the basin in 1985. Although the total ecosystem service value of the basin showed a slight increase over the study period, it was observed that the total value of services obtained from natural ecosystems is expected to decline by 36.24% between 1985 and 2050. The losses of services obtained from natural ecosystems, such as water regulation and erosion control, are major concern as the consequence has already been reported in the basin in the form of reduced water quality and productivity of the lakes due to an increased soil erosion and sediment transport in the basin. Therefore, special attention should be given to the rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems and the protection of remaining natural vegetation and water bodies to enhance natural capital and ecosystem services in the basin.

The segmentation results are capable of influencing the subsequent process effects. An image can be partitioned into a number of disjoint segments which is used to represent the image structures. It is found that it is more compact to represent an image and the low level and high structures can be combined. There are different types of methods to segment an image namely, threshold-based, edge-based and region-based. Region growing approach is image segmentation methods in which the neighboring pixels are examined and merged with the class region in case of no edges are detected. The iteration is done for every pixel boundary. Unlike gradient and Laplacian methods, the edges of the region are found by the region growing and it is perfectly their region. The images are determined by the LANDSAT TM satellite data. The remote sensing technique is used for collecting information about the Coimbatore district. The sensed data is a key to many diverse applications. The contribution of this work for Coimbatore district is to find the change of the Land used and Land covered in the entire region and also to find the changes in the green lands, vegetation and Land surface utilized for urban area. The neighboring regions are taken into account and the similarities are checked in the growing process. No single region is allowed to dominate the entire proceedings. A certain number of regions are allowed to grow at a time. Comparable regions will gradually combine into expanding regions. The Control of these methods may be quite complicated but efficient methods have been developed. The directions of growing pixels are easy and efficient to implement on parallel computers. The threshold-based segmentation is completely depending on the gray level images which regards the reflectivity of the featured images.

Comparing these coverage with the data of 2007, show a clear shift among residential areas, olive groves and forest terrain. It was found that the agricultural areas, particularly along the shoreline, were converted into resort houses and that the olive groves (the dominant land use) shifted from lower regions to its upper sectors.

Therefore, it is particularly important to quantitatively grasp the spatiotemporal pattern of LULC to formulate and implement land use planning. This study extracted LULC by the combination of supervised classification and manual visual interpretation and quantitatively analyzed the spatiotemporal changes in LULC. Finally, the land use situation was simulated, and the driving forces affecting LULC changes were analyzed with the logistic regression-cellular automata-Markov chain (LR-CA-Markov) and FLUS models. The results showed that the ecological environment underwent more noticeable changes in approximately the year 2000. Relatively speaking, LULC changes were the most dramatic during 1987-1997. With the implementation of the Grain for Green Project (GFGP) in 1999, the ecological environment began to develop towards a positive trend, but built-up land area has also grown rapidly. The economy was the main factor influencing the change in LULC. The simulation results showed that the simulation accuracy and kappa coefficient of the LR-CA-Markov and FLUS models were both greater than 0.85, and the prediction results of the same land-type change trend were basically the same. On this basis, the land use scenario in 2027-2047 was predicted. The results showed that the LULC would change dramatically over the next 30 years (likely due to urban expansion). Therefore, LULC research in arid regions can provide theoretical guidance for protecting the ecological environment, rationally planning land use, and realizing the sustainable development of arid zones, such as the economy, society, and ecological environment.",LULC,Logistic regression,CA-Markov,FLUS,Land use simulation,,,"Luo, Haiping","Tan, Zhe","Ma, Yunrui",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Assessments of surface urban heat island (UHI) usually focused on using remote sensing and land cover data to quantify UHI intensity and spatial distribution within a certain period. However, the mechanisms and complex interactions in landscape dynamics and land surface thermal features are still being assessed. In this study, we developed and implemented a novel approach to characterize landscape thermal conditions by focusing on UHI intensity and its spatiotemporal variation using the recently available time series of Landsat land surface temperature and land cover change products. We analyzed land surface temperature changes in urban and surrounding non-urban lands to quantify the UHI intensity and landscape thermal conditions in the Atlanta and Minneapolis metropolitan areas of the United States. Our results revealed that UHI intensities had averages of 3.4 degrees C and 3.3 degrees C in the Atlanta and Minneapolis metropolitan areas, respectively. The dominant land cover type in rural areas and urban imperviousness cover determines the UHI intensity. Increasing trends of 0.04 degrees C/year and 0.01 degrees C/year in UHI intensity between 1985 and 2018 were found in Atlanta and Minneapolis, respectively. The UHI intensity variations in 1985 and 2018 suggest that the magnitudes and temporal variations of UHI intensity averaged from all urban land cover classes are close to the UHI intensity estimated from the low intensity urban area only while the UHI intensities are more than 2 degrees C larger in medium to high and high intensity urban areas. The UHI intensities estimated from the maximum temperature that have statistically significant increasing trends suggest that the maximum temperature is a good element for measuring UHI effect. Urban land cover dynamics play an important role in controlling temporal variation of UHI and the UHI hotspots. Our findings support the scientific value of implementing the prototype approach as an objective framework to quantify and monitor UHI intensity at a large geographic extent.",Land surface temperature,Time series,Urban,Land cover,Landsat,,,"Auch, Roger","Gallo, Kevin","Wu, Zhuoting","Kolian, Michael",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, in this paper, we try to explore the use of facade from the oblique images to enhance the accuracy of land-cover classification. Firstly, we locate the facades by finding the elevation changes and the corresponding above-ground objects. Then, the facade images are cropped from oblique images and the color and Haar-like features are extracted as facade features. Finally, following the object-based land-cover classification, super-pixels are generated and used as the basic unit for the feature extraction and classification.

Yet land abandonment is an understudied aspect of land use change in social-ecological systems. Here we provide more information on this phenomenon by exploring cropland abandonment during 1950-2010 in four former South African 'homelands'-part of the 'Apartheid' era racially-based land allocation programs-characterized by rural, smallholder farmers. Cropland abandonment 1950-2010 was widespread in all surveyed sites (KwaZulu: 0.08% year(-1), Transkei: 0.13% year(-1), Lebowa: 0.23% year(-1), Venda: 0.28% year(-1)), with rates peaking between 1970 and 1990, with concomitant increases (up to 0.16% year(-1)) of woody vegetation cover at the expense of grassland cover. Active and past farmers attributed cropland abandonment to a lack of draught power, rainfall variability and droughts, and a more modernized youth disinclined to living a marginal agrarian lifestyle. We discuss the potential social and ecological implications of abandoned croplands at the local and regional scales, as the deagrarianization trend is unlikely to abate considering the failure of current South African national agricultural incentives.",agricultural land abandonment,bush encroachment,deagrarianization,homelands,old fields,social-ecological systems,rural farmers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the influence of land use and land cover change and other causative factors on landslide susceptibility is evaluated in the Lower Mekong Basin. Frequency ratio analysis is performed to quantify the relationship between LULC change and susceptibility. Detailed landslide inventory maps are used for analysis with yearly LULC maps. The LULC change is used as a contributing variable in a logistic regression-based susceptibility model with other variables including distance to roads, slope, aspect, forest loss, and soil properties. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and Area Under the Curve are estimated for the model trained by each landslide inventory. The models show good performance, with AUC values ranging from 0.697 to 0.958 and an average AUC equal to 0.820. Both the Frequency Ratio analysis and the Logistic Regression models indicate LULC change from agricultural land to forest has a positive correlation with landslide occurrence. The most significant factors in the models are found to be distance to roads, slope, and aspect. A better understanding of the effects of LULC on landslide susceptibility can be useful for local land and disaster management and for the implementation of LULC as a factor in future susceptibility models.

However, the integration of the system dynamic (SD) and the cellular automata (CA) model have been rarely employed in LULCC simulations, although it allows for combining the advantages of each approach and therefore improving the simulation accuracy. In this study, we integrated an SD model and a CA model to predict LULCC under three future development scenarios in Northern Shanxi province of China, a typical agro-pastoral transitional zone. The results indicated that our integrated approach represented the impacts of natural and socioeconomic factors on LULCC well, and could accurately simulate the magnitude and spatial pattern of LULCC. The modeling scenarios illustrated that different development pathways would lead to various LULCC patterns. This study demonstrated the advantages of the integration approach for simulating LULCC and suggests that LULCC is affected to a large degree by natural and socioeconomic factors.

Using the USGS land-cover data set (2006) and aerial photographs (1940), we assessed the current and historical percent land cover (urban, agriculture, and forests) at local and landscape scales for each sampling site. Using percent land cover as predictors and diversity indices (species richness, Simpson's index, and relative abundance) as response variables, we developed a stepwise multiple regression model and a redundancy analysis. Both analyses indicated the negative impacts of historical land uses, particularly row-crop agriculture, on stream salamander diversity and community structure rendering streams unsuitable for all but the most tolerant species. Legacy effects were prominent in the Piedmont where protected areas with agricultural history were species-deprived (70% decline) compared with stream habitats that had sustained a continuous forest cover through time.

Forests contribute to the sustainability of the planet by controlling soil erosion in agricultural areas and by moderating the effects of climate change. However, Ethiopia's forest resources have been under intense pressure because of the increased demand for wood products and agricultural conversion. As one of the potential solutions, the PFM programme was implemented in 1990. This study set out to investigate the effects of the PFM programme on land use and land cover (LULC) in the Alle district of southwest Ethiopia, as well as the variables influencing community involvement and the obstacles to PFM implementation and community involvement.

As an important step, feature normalization techniques have been studied by the areas of pattern recognition. Nevertheless, because of the totally different imaging mechanisms of optical and SAR sensors, most of the existing normalization approaches are not suitable for optical and SAR data fusion. Moreover, whether normalization is a significant step remains unclear regarding optical and SAR fusion. Taking the Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT-5) and the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS)/Phased Array type L-band SAR (PALSAR) (HH and HV polarizations) as the optical and SAR data, this letter aims to evaluate the impact of feature normalization. Experimental results indicated that feature normalization is not necessarily significant depending on fusion methods. For instance, distribution-dependent classifiers (e.g., a maximum likelihood classifier) are independent of feature normalization; thus, it has no impact on the results when using these classifiers. Moreover, advanced classifiers (e.g., a support vector machine) with built-in normalization are also not influenced by feature normalization. In contrast, a minimum distance classifier and an artificial neural network (ANN) depend on the input values of optical and SAR features and thus can be influenced by feature normalization. However, our experiments showed a fluctuation in classification accuracy using an ANN with normalized features. Therefore, more experiments are required to investigate the optimal normalization approaches for the optical and SAR images when using an ANN as the fusion method.",Land use/land cover (LULC),normalization,optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data fusion,polarimetric SAR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, deforestation and land degradation can lead to soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, and greenhouse gas emissions, affecting the quality of soil, air, and water resources. The present research examined changes in (LU/LC) within the underdeveloped regions of Balochistan and Sindh provinces, which are situated in Pakistan. In order to monitor temporal variations of LU/LC, we employed Geographic Information System (GIS) technique, to conduct an analysis of satellite imagery obtained from the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) during the time period spanning from 2013 to 2023. In order to obtain an accurate LU/LC classification, we used principal component analysis (PCA) and a supervised classification approach using the maximum likelihood algorithm (MLC). According to the results of our study, there was a decrease in the extent of water bodies (- 593.24 km2) and vegetation (- 68.50 km2) by - 3.43% and - 0.40% respectively. In contrast, the area occupied by settlements in the investigated region had a 2.23% rise, reaching a total of 385.66 square kilometers. Similarly, the extent of barren land also expanded by 1.60%, encompassing a total area of 276.04 square kilometers, during the course of the last decade. The overall accuracy (94.25% and 95.75%) and K value (91.75% and 93.50%) were achieved during the year 2013 and 2023 respectively. The enhancement of agricultural output in Pakistan is of utmost importance in order to improve the income of farmers, mitigate food scarcity, stimulate economic growth, and facilitate the expansion of exports. To enhance agricultural productivity, it is recommended that the government undertake targeted initiatives that aimed at enhancing water infrastructure and optimizing land use to foster a sustainable ecological framework. Integrating the sustainable ecological framework provides a foundation for informed decision-making and effective resource management. By identifying areas of urban expansion, agricultural intensification, or alterations in natural LU/LC, stakeholders can design targeted conservation strategies, mitigating potential environmental degradation and promoting biodiversity conservation.

These two land-use frameworks were used to explore how the large scale plantation of cellulosic biofuels to meet global energy demand impacts the future climate. The land cover of the Community Atmospheric Model Version 3.0 (CAM3.0) was manipulated to reflect these four different land use and energy scenarios (i.e. PCCR and OLSR with and without biofuels). CAM3.0 was run to equilibrium, under 1990 and 2050 climate conditions, in order to assess the impact these land cover changes have on the atmospheric state. For the 2050 climate conditions, CAM was prescribed with concentrations of radiatively active trace gases (a.k.a. greenhouse gases) that result from a moderate stabilization target by the end of the 21st century.Overall in the extratropics, the intensification and deforestation scenarios increase the land-surface reflectivity over many areas of the globe, indicating that biofuel cropland is replacing darker land-vegetation types, decreasing absorption of solar radiation, which leads to a cooling effect. These patterns are strongest in the northern hemisphere, and occur to a greater extent in the PCCR scenarios. Moreover, the cooling is strongest when a biofuel policy is implemented. These temperature changes are for the most part overwhelmed by the trace-gas forcing (i.e. anthropogenic warming). However, in some regions, land surface changes in the PCCR case can counteract or notably lessen the warming.In much of the Amazonian and African tropics, however, the PCCR deforestation leads to a decrease in evaporative fraction, and an increase in sensible heat flux, leading to a warming effects over regions where biofuels have replaced tropical forests. These local, land-use induced changes in surface heat fluxes have non-local impacts on cloudiness and precipitation, the majority of which occur over oceans. The majority of the precipitation results show patterns which counteract those due to trace-gas forcing. We conclude that the implementation of a future energy policy where biofuels play a significant part, as well as the way we price land and the constraints placed on deforestation, both have a statistically significant impact on climate in 2050, and the land use change which led to the largest replacement of forested lands with biofuel cropland had the largest latitudinally-dependent impact on temperatures around the world.",land use,land cover,biofuels,modeling,climate change,,,"Sokolov, Andrei","Kicklighter, David","Melillo, Jerry","Cai, Yongxia","Reilly, John","Gurgel, Angelo","Felzer, Ben","Paltsev, Sergey",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,19TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION (MODSIM2011),,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerical modeling to predict and estimate hurricane surge flooding is currently widely used for research, planning, decision making, and emergency response. Land cover plays an important role in hurricane surge numerical modeling because of its impacts on the forcing (changes in wind momentum transfer to water column) and dissipation (bottom friction) mechanisms of storm surge. In this study, the hydrodynamic model ADCIRC was used to investigate predicted surge response in bays on the central and lower Texas coast using different land cover data sets: (1) Coastal Change Analysis Program for 1996, 2001, and 2006; (2) the National Land Cover Dataset for 1992, 2001, and 2006; and (3) the National Wetlands Inventory for 1993. Hypothetical storms were simulated with varying the storm track, forward speed, central pressure, and radius to maximum wind, totaling 140 simulations. Data set choice impacts the mean of maximum surges throughout the study area, and variability in the surge prediction due to land cover data set choice strongly depends on storm characteristics and geographical location of the bay in relation to storm track. Errors in surge estimation due to land cover choice are approximately 7% of the surge value, with change in surge prediction varying by as much as 1 m, depending on location and storm condition. Finally, the impact of land cover choice on the accuracy of simulating surges for Hurricane Bret in 1999 is evaluated.",hurricanes,storm surge,land cover,bottom friction,model uncertainty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From 1950 to about 1980, Austria mainly strove to achieve self-sufficiency as an agricultural producer. This goal was met in the 1970s, largely through agricultural intensification. Since then, the primary focus of Austrian agricultural policy has been to reduce agricultural overproduction, to preserve the existing farm structure, as well as to keep as large an agricultural area under cultivation as is possible. As a consequence, since the 1980s, yields rose slowly and subsidized fallow covered substantial parts of cropland area. Austria joined the European Union in 1995, after which agricultural policy was, to a large extent, determined by the EU Common Agricultural Policy. From 1950 to 1995 we observe a continuous trend of declining cropland and grassland areas, increases in the areas of built-up and infrastructure land, and a slow increase in forested areas. The segregation of cropland cultivation and livestock husbandry leads to a concentration of cropland in fertile lowlands and of grasslands in the lower alpine regions from which crops are retreating. As a result of livestock being fed increasing amounts of cropland produce and imported protein feedstuffs, there was a disintegration of local nutrient cycles and a rising input of mineral fertilizer. We interpret these changes as a consequence of the massive input of fossil energy into Austria's agricultural system, which allowed a surge in the intensification of transport. We analyze these trends using GIS maps based upon statistic data. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In the present study, Remote Sensing, Geographic Information System (GIS) and statistical techniques are used to understand the LULC dynamics and possible driving forces in a thickly populated Yamuna river basin of India. The National Capital Territory of Delhi, one of the world's largest urban agglomerations, occurs in this river basin. The LULC maps on 1: 250,000 scales prepared at decadal interval (1985, 1995 and 2005) using satellite images are used for studying the LULC dynamics. The major LULC changes observed during the study period are increase in cropland (65.7% to 67.9%) and built-up (0.9% to 1.9%) and decrease in forest (17.1% to 16.4%) and water bodies (2.3% to 1.9%). The dominant processes of the LULC changes include transitions from forest, grassland, shrub land, water bodies and wasteland to cropland; transitions from cropland, shrub land, wasteland, grassland and forest to built-up; conversion of forest to cropland, shrub land, plantation and built-up; and transitions from water bodies to cropland, shrub land and wasteland. Most of the transitions are reversible in nature. The statistical analysis (logistic regression) between decadal LULC maps and drivers indicates that LULC changes are driven by a multitude of factors in different combinations and with different importance. Socioeconomic, demographic and proximity drivers mainly influence the LULC change processes in the study area in decreasing order of importance. The insights gained are important for simulating future LULC scenarios as input for land management policy making.",land use and land cover (LULC),remote sensing,geographic information system,logistic regression,drivers of LULC change,Yamuna basin,,"Krishnamurthy, Y.

We mapped a suite of land-use classes based on the seasonal phenology of double- and single season cropping regimes; pasture; and bare soil cropland (fallow). Analyses focus specifically on the Corredor Bioceanico, which bisects some of the most sensitive and poorly understood ecosystems in the world and indirectly creating one of the most important agricultural region-deforestation hotspots in South America at the present time. Training data to predict class membership were based on MODIS NDVI annual mean, maximum, minimum, and amplitude derived from field observations, semi-structured interviews, and aerial videography. Results show that over 8,000 km(2) of forest was lost during the 14-year study period. In the first years of cultivation, pasture is the dominant land use, but quickly gives way to cropland. The main findings according to forest type is that transitional forest types on deep and poorly drained soils of alluvial plains have lost the most in terms of percentage area cleared. The resulting transition pathways can potentially provide decision-makers with more detailed insight as to the proximate causes or driving forces of land change in addition to the most threatened forests remaining in the Tierras Bajas and those most likely to be cleared in the Brazilian Shield and Pantanal.

Recognizing the urgency of this issue, the government of Ethiopia introduced Participatory Forest Management (PFM) and devolved forest management responsibilities to enhance forest conservation. Therefore, this assessment examines the impacts of PFM on forest cover based on an analysis of the Land Use/Land Cover Change (LULCC) over the last 23 years in Adaba-Dodola, and its implications for REDD+ implementation. The study involved determining the LULCC of the Adaba-Dodola forest after the introduction of PFM from 2000 to 2023. Landsat images of 2000, 2012, and 2023 were analyzed to detect LULCC. The study result showed that the Adaba-Dodola forest cover increased by 1.83% since the PFM was introduced. The decreased agricultural land by 0.87% was the main factor attributed to the increase in shrub cover, while shrubland attributed to the rise in forest cover. Net areas of about 148 ha/year of shrublands were converted into forest land owing to significant forest regeneration, while shrublands had a net gain of 110.5 ha/year from agriculture and grasslands between 2000 and 2023. The increase in forest cover is attributed to the effectiveness of PFM in halting deforestation and promoting forest conservation. Thus, the PFM approach is a tool for preserving forest ecosystems and mitigating the adverse effects of deforestation and forest degradation, therefore would be used as an umbrella for implementing REDD+.",Community forest,Deforestation,Change detection,Land use/land cover,REDD plus,,,"Marquardt, Kristina",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quantitative assessment of LULC impacts on runoff generations is vital for water resources development. The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model was used to study the effect of LULC change on streamflows. In addition to this, the present study proposed a newly developed flow-routing model called runoff coefficient routing model (RCRM). This new model is simple and requires limited data, such as precipitation, LULC and streamflows as compared to other models, which require meteorological and many more input data. The Nethravathi River basin was selected for testing the RCRM model with the SWAT model to study land use-land cover change on streamflows. The SWAT model and RCRM model have been calibrated for 2001-2005 and validated for 2006-2009 daily data. Results have shown that the simulated streams are well correlated with observed streamflows with a coefficient of correlation (R2) equal to 0.82 in calibration and 0.68 in validation period. Whereas, the RCRM model results have shown R2 of 0.81 and 0.66 in the calibration and validation period. Finally, the SWAT and RCRM results were compared. It is observed that the results of the RCRM model have shown a good agreement with SWAT model results of R2 equal to 0.99 and 0.98, respectively, in the calibration and validation period. The sensitivity analysis was also carried out based on Latin hypercube one factor-at-a-time (LH-OAT) method using the SWAT model and found 11 sensitive parameters out of 28 parameters. Model performance was carried out using the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE) and found 0.81 for calibration and 0.62 for the validation period in the SWAT model. RCRM has NSE of 0.79 and 0.63. The response of the streamflows for the year 2013 was simulated from the calibrated model. The results showed that the observed streamflows have shown good correlation with simulated streamflows with R2 values of 0.86 and NSE of 0.81. From the results, it is concluded that the runoff shows early response in the year 2013 compared to the year 2003. This is mainly due to changes in LULC, which shows the conversion of forest to agricultural area and increase in built-up area from 2003 to 2013. The effect of LULC change on the hydrological model parameters were calculated and observed a decrease in evapotranspiration (ET) of about 4.5%, an increase in runoff of about 0.9%, and an increase in groundwater of about 1.12%. In conclusion, the proposed RCRM in the present study simulates streamflows at par with the SWAT model with only few input data. Hence, the newly developed RCRM model would be used to study streamflows responses to LULC changes.",Land use land cover,Nethravathi river basin,Runoff,Streamflows response,Soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model,Sensitivity analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study aims to estimate future LULC and seasonal (summer and winter) LST scenarios in one of the fastest-growing megacities and the business capital of Bangladesh, named as Chattogram. Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and Landsat thermal bands were used to retrieve LULC and LST changing patterns for 1999, 2009 and 2019, respectively. The Cellular Automata (CA) and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) machine learning algorithms were applied to simulate the LULC and seasonal LST scenarios for 2029 and 2039. The CA and ANN model were validated using simulated and estimated LULC and LST data for 2019. The CA model demonstrated an excellent accuracy with an overall kappa value of 0.82. Mean Square Error (MSE) and Correlation coefficient (R) values were used for ANN model validation, which also produced excellent results with 0.523 and 0.796 in summer and 0.6023 and 0.831 in winter season, respectively. Simulated LULC revealed a substantial increase in the urban built-up areas by 9.23% (2029) and 13.59% (2039), compared with the year 2019. Simulated summer LST demonstrates that 31.30% and 35.02% area will likely to face surface temperature more than 36 degrees C, followed by 1.28% and 29.53% area in winter season for year 2029 and 2039, respectively.

Firstly, the analysis of the TM Remote Sensing images in 1995 and 2008 and other related data in Three Gorges Reservoir Region was made, then the area value of different land use/land cover type in 1995 and 2008 was extracted, the change law of different type was obtained. On the other hand, the change law of different environment parameters in 1995 and 2008 was made by querying the Statistical Data. The relationship between the Land Use/Land Cover Changes and Environment changes and the reason of the relationship were discussed at last. The Remote Sensing (RS) method provides abundant and real-time information, and Geographic Information System (GIS) has powerful functions in data processing and spatial analysis. The combination of RS and GIS has inestimable advantages compared with the traditional methods, and is highly effective in analyzing the relationship between the land use/land cover changes and environment changes in Three Gorges Reservoir Region.",Three Gorges Reservoir Region,Land Use/Land Cover Changes,Environment changes,Remote Sensing (RS),Geographic Information System (GIS),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2009 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING, VOLS 1-9",,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the high spatial heterogeneity of site conditions and the similarities in spectral reflectance and shapes among different vegetation types, land cover mapping accuracy is often low in mixed regions with multiple vegetation types. In addition to traditional factors such as spectral characteristics, topography, and commonly used features, we present a novel land cover mapping framework that incorporates evapotranspiration, which exhibits significant variations among vegetation types. The proposed land cover mapping framework consists of the following steps: 1) estimating year-round actual evapotranspiration using the remote sensing SEABL model; 2) training a classifier to classify land cover based on integrated factors, including spectral bands, spectral indices, topography, night light data, and evapotranspiration; 3) generating land use and land cover mapping using evapotranspiration (ETLULC); and 4) comparing and evaluating the accuracy and variability of results against different input schemes and existing products. In a typical mixed region with multiple vegetation types, the ETLULC framework demonstrates impressive performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 93%. The classification accuracy for all land cover types exceeds 90%. Compared to traditional methodologies that do not incorporate evapotranspiration as an input, ETLULC significantly improves the recognition accuracy for cropland, forest, and grassland by 5.4%-15.3%, 0%-15.7%, and 3.0%-20.4%, respectively. Moreover, ETLULC exhibits strong agreement with existing products applied in the Ordos Basin, particularly for cropland (54.7%-82.3%), forest (32.2%-71.7%), and grassland (56.4%-94.3%). The performance of ETLULC underscores the effectiveness of this innovative land cover mapping framework. This study introduces a novel approach by leveraging the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation characterized by evapotranspiration to enhance the accuracy of land cover mapping. This method holds significant practical value and has broad applicability in identifying effective feature combinations for vegetation recognition in extensively distributed mixed vegetation regions.",Vegetation mapping,Land surface,Remote sensing,Spatial resolution,Meteorology,Grasslands,Meters,"Zhang, Jianyun","Wang, Guoqing","Liu, Cuishan","Wu, Houfa",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Evapotranspiration,land cover classification,,,,,,remote sensing,vegetation,,,

However, it is challenging to distinguish agricultural abandonment from transitional classes such as fallow land at high spatial resolutions due to the complexity of change process. To date, no robust approach exists to detect when agricultural land abandonment occurred based on 30-m Landsat images. Our goal here was to develop a new approach to detect the extent and the exact timing of agricultural land abandonment using spatial and temporal segments derived from Landsat time series. We tested our approach for one Landsat footprint in the Caucasus, covering parts of Russia and Georgia, where agricultural land abandonment is widespread. First, we generated agricultural land image objects from multi-date Landsat imagery using a multi resolution segmentation approach. Second, we estimated the probability for each object that agricultural land was used each year based on Landsat temporal-spectral metrics and a random forest model. Third, we applied temporal segmentation of the resulting agricultural land probability time series to identify change classes and detect when abandonment occurred. We found that our approach was able to accurately separate agricultural abandonment from active agricultural lands, fallow land, and re-cultivation. Our spatial and temporal segmentation approach captured the changes at the object level well (overall mapping accuracy = 97 +/- 1%), and performed substantially better than pixel-level change detection (overall accuracy = 82 +/- 3%). We found strong spatial and temporal variations in agricultural land abandonment rates in our study area, likely a consequence of regional wars after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In summary, the combination of spatial and temporal segmentation approaches of time-series is a robust method to track agricultural land abandonment and may be relevant for other land-use changes as well.",Change detection,Agricultural land abandonment,Landsat,Land-use change,Land-cover probability,Segmentation,LandTrendr,"Bleyhl, Benjamin","Buchner, Johanna","Radeloff, Volker C.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Trajectory-based approach,Europe,,,,,,Caucasus,,,,

The use of supervised classification with maximum likelihood algorithm in QGIS was employed to generate LULC maps of 1991, 2001, 2011, and 2021. Molusce Plugin in QGIS was applied to predict probabilities of LULC changes in 10 years (2021-2031). The results showed that high-density forest has disappeared from 1991 to 2021 while built-up has increased and remained the most dominant LULC from 2011 to 2021. There is a continual decline in the number of plant and animal species in and around the Owabi catchment. This can be attributed to the decline of high-density forests and increased built-up in the study area through human actions. The study identified the influence of human activities as the key forces of LULC change to biodiversity loss. This problem stemmed from the taste for housing and trading activities in the Kumasi Metropolitan Area which has resulted in an increasing demand for settlement because of its closeness to Kumasi and its environs. The study recommends that stringent preventive measures should be developed and enforced by various stakeholders including the Forestry Commission, Ghana Water Company Limited, Environmental Protection Agency, as well as the District/Municipal Assemblies to safeguard the forest from human activities.

Ecological quality is a comprehensive spatial and temporal measure of an ecosystem's elements, structure and function, reflecting the ecological state under external pressures. However, how land use/land cover change affects the ecological quality during urbanization has rarely been explored. In this study, Jinan, a megacity in the lower Yellow River basin, was taken as a typical region, and the response of ecological quality to the land use/land cover change in 2000, 2010 and 2020 was retrieved using the remote sensing ecological index. For the mixed land use/land cover change types, a type-decomposition and spatial heterogeneity quantification method based on the abundance index was proposed, and the impact mechanisms of the land use/land cover change on the ecological quality were revealed by coupling with GeoDetector. The results show that: (1) Farmland and built-up areas, as the dominant land use/land cover types, were the primary factors controlling the spatial pattern of ecological quality. (2) Urban expansion and farmland protection policies resulted in the transfer of farmland and woodland to built-up areas as well as the transfer of woodland and grassland to farmland, which intensified the degradation of ecological quality. (3) Ecological protection policies prompted the transfer of farmland and grassland to woodland and the transfer of farmland to grassland as the main cause for the improvement of ecological quality. (4) Although ecological protection and urban development were implemented in parallel, uneven land use/land cover changes resulted in a 1.4 times expanded area of poorer ecological quality with increasingly serious spatial agglomeration effects.

The ecosystem service value (ESV) was assessed, and the ecological effect was analyzed based on LUCC. The results showed that the spatial distribution of land types in the Weihe River UEZ changed significantly from 2014 to 2020. The construction land gathered to the southeast. Especially, the vegetative land (i.e., forestland, grassland and other green land) and water body showed a slightly increasing trend since the official establishment of the UEZ in 2018. The cultivated land area gradually reduced, and the vegetative land area tended to be concentrated as well as expanded. Through the interpretation of GF-2 remote sensing data, the ESV at the Weihe River UEZ showed a downward trend in general. The high-value areas were mainly distributed in the Weihe River and its surrounding beach areas, which were greatly affected by river water scope. Construction land normally had low ESV, and it was affected by human activities obviously.

Results show that in general, the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and the Land Change Monitoring, Assessment and Projection (LCMAP) outperform other multi-class products, both in terms of higher individual class accuracy and with accuracy variability across classes. More specifically, F1 accuracy comparisons between the best performing USGS and non-USGS products indicate: (i) similar performance for the water class, (ii) USGS product outperformance in the developed (+1.3%), grass/shrub (+3.2%) and tree cover (+4.2%) classes, and (iii) non-USGS product (WorldCover) gains in the cropland (+5.1%) class. The NLCD and LCMAP also outperformed specialized single-class products, such as the Hansen Global Forest Change, the Cropland Data Layer and the Global Artificial Impervious Areas, while offering comparable results to the Global Surface Water Dynamics product. Spatial visualizations also allowed accuracy comparisons across different geographic areas. In general, the NLCD and LCMAP have disagreements mainly in the middle and southeastern part of conterminous U.S. while Esri, WorldCover and Dynamic World have most errors in the western U.S. Comparisons were also undertaken on a subset of the reference data, called spatial edge samples, that identifies samples surrounded by neighboring samples of different class labels, thus excluding easy-to-classify homogenous areas. There, the WorldCover product offers higher accuracies for the highly dynamic grass/shrub (+4.4%) and cropland (+8.1%) classes when compared to the NLCD and LCMAP products.

Karst environments are extremely fragile because of thin soil and small soil water holding capacity. A marked intensification of agricultural land use and deforestation due to increase of population and thus expansion of agricultural areas has made the karst environment even more delicate. In this study, the soil moisture contents (SMC) and hydraulic conductivities (K) along four karst hillslopes were measured in situ by time domain reflectometry and the Guelph Permeameter, respectively, at test plots, each of which has a different vegetative cover, landform, land surface slope, soil property and content of rock fragment. The statistical results from the measurements show that land cover changes strongly affect the distribution of soil moisture and hydraulic properties. Compared with SMC in the bare soil areas, SMC values are 30.5, 20.1 and 10.2% greater in the forest, shrub and grass areas, respectively. Vegetation roots significantly increase permeability of low-layer silt soils. Measured K values were 0.8, 0.6 and 0.01 cm/min for the forest, agriculture and bare soil areas, respectively. When the forest was destroyed by fire or cut to become an agricultural area or bare soils, SMC would be reduced by 13.1 and 32.1%, respectively. If deforestation leads to strong rock desertification, SMC was reduced by 70%. Bedrock fractures significantly reduce the SMC in the overlying layer, but increase K values. SMC values of 30 -45% would be reduced to 17-30% for the soil layer embedding rocks with and without fractures, respectively. K values could be increased from 1.0 to 8.5 cm/min.

In this research, the upper basin of Miyun Reservoir in northern Beijing was chosen as study area because of its importance to ecological security of Beijing, the Capital City of China. The equivalent factor method was used to evaluate the ESV, and the responses of spatial and temporal variations of ESV to LULC transformations were explored by gridding and spatial autocorrelation analysis during years 1990-2020. The results indicate that the total ESV increase from 19.367 billion Yuan to 20.419 billion Yuan during 1990-2020.

Climate warming created the potential environment for the conversion of grassland and swampland into cropland. Land resources policy made by central and provincial governments of China affected the pattern and intensity of land use. Land use/cover changes accompanied by climatic variation brought out a series of environmental consequences, such as sand desertification of land, land salinization and alkalinization, grassland degradation, and more frequent floods.

However, reduced classification accuracy of dryland cities often occurs in global land cover data. Although many advanced classification techniques (i.e., convolutional neural networks (CNN)) have been intensively applied to classify urban land cover because of their excellent performance, specific classification models focusing on typical dryland cities are still scarce. This is mainly attributed to the similar features between urban and non-urban areas, as well as the insufficient training samples in this specific region. To fill this gap, this study trained a CNN model to improve the urban land classification accuracy for seven dryland cities based on rigorous training sample selection. The assessment showed that our proposed model performed with higher overall accuracy (92.63%) than several emerging land cover products, including Esri 2020 Land Cover (75.55%), GlobeLand30 (73.24%), GLC_FCS30-2020 (69.68%), ESA WorldCover2020 (64.38%), and FROM-GLC 2017v1 (61.13%). In addition, the classification accuracy of the dominant land types in the CNN-classified data exceeded the selected products.

Improved land management capacity is critically dependent on real-time or near real-time monitoring of land-use/land cover change (LUCC) to the extent to which solutions to a whole host of urban/rural interface development issues may be well managed promptly. Yet previous processing with LULC methods is often time-consuming, laborious, and tedious making the outputs unavailable within the required time window. This paper presents a new image classification approach based on a novel neural computing technique that is applied to identify the LULC patterns in a fast growing urban region with the aid of 2.5-meter resolution SPOT-5 image products. The classifier was constructed based on the partial Lanczos extreme learning machine (PL-ELM), which is a novel machine learning algorithm with fast learning speed and outstanding generalization performance. Since some different classes of LULC may be linked with similar spectral characteristics, texture features and vegetation indexes were extracted and included during the classification process to enhance the discernability. A validation procedure based on ground truth data and comparisons with some classic classifiers prove the credibility of the proposed PL-ELM classification approach in terms of the classification accuracy as well as the processing speed. A case study in Dalian Development Area (DDA) with the aid of the SPOT-5 satellite images collected in the year of 2003 and 2007 and PL-ELM fully supports the monitoring needs and aids in the rapid change detection with respect to both urban expansion and coastal land reclamations.",land use and land cover,computational intelligence,image processing,SPOT-5,PL-ELM,,,"Chen, Liang-Chien","Xu, Shiguo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One main cause is that most of land use/land cover change applications require multi-temporal acquisitions over the same area, that introduces the need for accurate pre-processing of the dataset, in both geo-referencing and radiometry. Moreover, single multi-spectral images can be hundred of megabytes in size and therefore image time series are even more difficult to be handled and processed in real time. The approach here proposed foresees the use of a robust land cover classification system named SOIL MAPPER (R) to reduce input data size by assigning a semantic meaning (in the land cover domain) to each pixel of a single image. Land cover transitions and land use maps can be expressed as evolutions of land cover classes (features) on temporal domain. This permits to define 'trajectories' in the features - time space, that define specific transition or periodic behaviour. The target system, named Land Classification System, provides fully automatic and real time land use/land cover change analysis and includes fundamental sub-systems for accurate radiometric calibration, accurate geo-referencing (with geolocation within the pixel size) and accurate remapping onto an Earth fixed grid. The characteristics of the selected pre-classification system and Earth fixed grid allow general application across different sensors.

To investigate the rates, causes, and spatial and temporal patterns of forest harvest on private tracts throughout the Cascade Mountains, we relied on a new generation of annual land-use/land-cover (LULC) products created from the application of the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm to Landsat satellite imagery collected from 1985 to 2014. We calculated metrics of landscape pattern using patches of intact and harvested forest in each annual layer to identify changes throughout the time series. Patch dynamics revealed four distinct eras of logging trends that align with prevailing regulations and economic conditions. We used multiple logistic regression to determine the biophysical and anthropogenic factors that influence fine-scale selection of harvest stands in each time period. Results show that private lands forest cover became significantly reduced and more fragmented from 1985 to 2014.

The main objective of this study is to evaluate land use/land cover changes for the time period of 1991-2022 and predict future changes using the CA-ANN model in the Upper Omo-Gibe River basin. Landsat-5 TM for 1991, 1997, and 2004, Landsat-7 ETM+ for 2010, and Landsat-8 (OLI) for 2016 and 2022 were downloaded from the USGS Earth Explorer Data Center. A random forest machine learning algorithm was employed for LULC classification. The LULC classification result was evaluated using an accuracy assessment technique to assure the correctness of the classification method employing the kappa coefficient. Kappa coefficient values of the classification indicate that there was strong agreement between the classified and reference data. Using the MOLUSCE plugin of QGIS and the CA-ANN model, future LULC changes were predicted. Artificial neural network (ANN) and cellular automata (CA) machine learning methods were made available for LULC change modeling and prediction via the QGIS MOLUSCE plugin. Transition potential modeling was computed, and future LULC changes were predicted using the CA-ANN model. An overall accuracy of 86.53% and an overall kappa value of 0.82 were obtained by comparing the actual data of 2022 with the simulated LULC data from the same year. The study findings revealed that between 2022 and 2037, agricultural land (63.09%) and shrubland (5.74%) showed significant increases, and forest (-48.10%) and grassland (-0.31%) decreased.

Despite some of the methodological limitations (like the minimum surface change), the Corine Land Cover turned out to be a powerful tool and it allowed us to detect an intense correlation between the socioeconomic and the structural trends in land use, in specific spatial contexts. The artificial surfaces are constantly increasing and this trend is rather visible as a distance function to the major Romanian cities. The most interesting changes occurred in the case of the agricultural polygons. The main trend emphasized by our analysis regards the redeployment of large farms in areas of agronomic and environmental territorial optimum.

LULC classification based on satellite images taken by Landsat data in summer dates of 1991, 1997, 2005 and 2016, were classified into four LULC types: built up area; vegetation area; barren land; and surface water.

The results show that the built up area was approximately 30% in 1991, then, it was sharply increasing to approximately 55% of the total area in 2016. The changing trends of LST tend to be increasing while the value of NDVI with dense vegetation meaning tend to be declining over the study period.

With the increased demand for land, the general trend has been the loss of forest land to agriculture and set-tlements. These changes have altered the water balance components through enhanced or reduced evaporation, peak flow, flooding, and river morphology. The aim of this review paper is to provide a meta-analysis on the effects of spatiotemporal changes in climate and LULC on river hydro-morphology in the tropics. Following a systematic search, 60 case studies were identified, of which the majority (68%) experienced forest loss due to agricultural and urban expansion, resulting in increased streamflow, surface flow, and total water yield and decreased ET and groundwater recharge. 12% of the case studies showed the impacts of LULCC on channel morphology features through sediment transport and riverbank erosion. Results from this study show limited correlation between LULCC and hydrological variables, indicating that there are likely other factors controlling hydrological processes. Catchment heterogeneity including soil and topography play an important role. Based on studies that project these changes into the future, similar trends are expected over the next decades, with dif-ferences based on LU and climate scenarios.

The study analyzes the subtle variability in ecosystem services offered by the various LULC biomes, including riverine wetland, built-up, cropland, forest, sandbar, and unused land. LULC classification is carried out using Landsat satellite imagery 5 and 8 for the years 2000, 2010, and 2020, using the random forest method. The spatiotemporal changing pattern of ESVs is assessed utilizing the value transfer method with two distinct value coefficients: global value coefficients (C14) for a worldwide perspective and modified local value coefficients X08 for a more specific local context. The results show a significant increase in built-up and unused land, with a corresponding decrease in wetlands and forests from 2000 to 2020.

Using field, Ikonos and Landsat data at three sites in northern Canada, we evaluate a physical unmixing method against two modeling approaches to map five land cover fractions that include bare, grass, deciduous shrub, conifer, and water along an 1100 km north-south transect crossing the tree-line of northern Canada. Error analyses are presented to assess factors that affect fractional mapping results, including modeling method (linear least squares inversion (LLSI) vs. linear regression vs. regression trees), number of Landsat spectral bands (3 vs. 5), local and distant fraction estimation using locally and globally calibrated models, and spatial resolution (30 m vs. 90 m). The ultimate purpose of this study is to determine if reliable land cover fractions can be obtained for biophysical modeling over northern Canada from a three band, resampled 90 m Landsat ETM+ mosaic north of the tree-line. Of the three modeling methods tested, linear regression and regression trees with five spectral bands produced the best local fraction estimates, while LLSI produced comparable results when unmixing was sufficiently determined. However, distant fraction estimation using both locally and globally calibrated models was most accurate using the three spectral bands available in the Landsat mosaic of northern Canada at 30 m resolution, and only slightly worse at 90 m resolution. While local calibrations produced more accurate fractions than global calibrations, application of local calibration models requires stratification of areas where local endmembers and models are representative. In the absence of such information, globally calibrated linear regression and regression trees to estimate separate fractions is an acceptable alternative, producing similar root mean square error, and an average absolute bias of less than 2%.

These projections are characterized by a high uncertainty in terms of quantity and allocation of projected changes, which can severely impact the results of environmental assessments. In this study, we identify hotspots of uncertainty, based on 43 simulations from 11 global-scale LULC change models representing a wide range of assumptions of future biophysical and socioeconomic conditions. We attribute components of uncertainty to input data, model structure, scenario storyline and a residual term, based on a regression analysis and analysis of variance. From this diverse set of models and scenarios, we find that the uncertainty varies, depending on the region and the LULC type under consideration. Hotspots of uncertainty appear mainly at the edges of globally important biomes (e.g., boreal and tropical forests). Our results indicate that an important source of uncertainty in forest and pasture areas originates from different input data applied in the models. Cropland, in contrast, is more consistent among the starting conditions, while variation in the projections gradually increases over time due to diverse scenario assumptions and different modeling approaches. Comparisons at the grid cell level indicate that disagreement is mainly related to LULC type definitions and the individual model allocation schemes. We conclude that improving the quality and consistency of observational data utilized in the modeling process and improving the allocation mechanisms of LULC change models remain important challenges. Current LULC representation in environmental assessments might miss the uncertainty arising from the diversity of LULC change modeling approaches, and many studies ignore the uncertainty in LULC projections in assessments of LULC change impacts on climate, water resources or biodiversity.",land-use allocation,land-use change,land-use model uncertainty,map comparison,model intercomparison,model variation,,"Arneth, Almut","Calvin, Katherine","Doelman, Jonathan","Eitelberg, David A.","Engstrom, Kerstin","Fujimori, Shinichiro","Hasegawa, Tomoko","Havlik, Petr","Humpenoeder, Florian","Jain, Atul K.","Krisztin, Tamas","Kyle, Page","Meiyappan, Prasanth","Popp, Alexander","Sands, Ronald D.","Schaldach, Ruediger","Schuengel, Jan","Stehfest, Elke","Tabeau, Andrzej","Van Meijl, Hans","Van Vliet, Jasper","Verburg, Peter H.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We detected major land cover changes over the 22-year study period. During this period, marshy land, mud, mud with small grass, and bare soil had decreased by 85%, 46%, 44%, and 24%, respectively, while agricultural land, medium forest, forest, and settlement had positive changes of 26%, 45%, 363%, and 59%, respectively. The primary drivers of such landscape change were erosion and accretion processes, human pressure, and the reforestation and land reclamation programs of the Bangladesh Government.

For this purpose, satellite images from 1984, 2002, and 2020 were classified at different levels by an object-based classification method. Accuracy assessments of the classified images were made and change detection analyses were performed using TerrSet software. The LULC changes were also estimated in different scenarios using a future land use simulation model (FLUS). The results show that natural and semi-natural areas are rapidly disappearing due to urban growth between 1984 and 2020. The results of the land use simulation show that by 2038, while the agricultural, pasture and water bodies will decrease, the built-up areas will increase.

Landsat images were used for evaluating LULC, LST, and HI for the years 1990, 2002, 2014, and 2018. Unsupervised and index-based classification approaches were used for mapping LULC. The mono-window algorithm was employed to identify the spatiotemporal variability of LST and HI. The analysis suggested that water bodies, forests, and bare land dwindled during these 28 years with an average of about 40%, 70%, and 45%, respectively. Agricultural land had been expanded from 1990 to 2002 and gradually stabilized in recent decades. Settlement areas increased alarmingly from 1990 to 2018. The water bodies, forests and bare lands were reduced due to the widening of agricultural land and rapid growth of urban area. The extents of the HI were found to be spreading out and became most extensive in 2018. LST had risen by around 5.5 degrees C from 1990 to 2018. The lower temperature zones prevailed in the water bodies, forests and agricultural lands whereas higher temperature zones were visible in the river sand bars and highly urbanized areas. The method used in this study is very successful in sparse built-up areas.

Accurate assessment of ET and its response to changing environments have important scientific and practical significance. In the context of global climate change, China has experienced tremendous land use/land cover change (LUCC) processes, leaving its ET dynamics and influencing factors still to be determined. Here, the interannual variation and spatial distribution characteristics of ET over China from 2005 to 2020 were analyzed based on the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) model. Then the separate contributions of climate change and LUCC to ET variation were quantified by controlling the LUCC scenario of the PT-JPL model. Results indicated that the PT-JPL model could accurately capture the variation of ET. The average annual ET over China from 2005 to 2020 was 464.52 mm, displaying a slightly increasing trend (0.46 mm.yr(-1)). The regions of ET increase were mainly concentrated in southern, central, and northeastern China. Separating the contributions of climate change and LUCC to ET revealed that climate change has a more significant effect on ET than LUCC. Among the five climatic factors, the contributions of relative humidity and precipitation to ET variation in dry basins were greater than those in humid or high-altitude basins, while temperature, net radiation, and wind speed showed an opposite performance. Net radiation and temperature were identified as the most critical factors affecting ET on the national scale. According to China's LUCC data from 2005 to 2020, the area conversion between forestlands, grasslands, and croplands was more significant than that between other land cover types. Wetlands and forestlands corresponded to higher ET values among all land cover types, and conversion to other land cover types would cause a decrease in ET.

For this purpose, using Corine Land Cover (1990, 2000, 2006, 2012, and 2018) dataset, the land cover of the area was determined in 5 different classes (artificial surface, agriculture, forest, water bodies, water), maps were produced, and tabular data were created. The changes in LC/LU between 1990 and 2018 were determined according to the Puyravaud land cover change rate and hot spot analysis methods. According to our findings, we determined that urbanization in Istanbul expanded the most in the east-west direction, and the agricultural and forest areas gradually decreased by 3.02% and 6.66% respectively; urban areas increased at the same rate of 9.69%. It is predicted that this change will continue increasing until 2030 when the forecasting method is applied in the field. It has been determined that the most important reasons for this situation are local government policies, population growth, and economic development initiatives applied in the area. As a result, it has emerged that measures should be taken based on sustainability and naturalness approaches to design urban development plans and to protect natural areas on a large scale, in order to limit possible LC/LU conversion from natural structure to urbanization in the area.",Natural areas,Land cover,Land use,Geographical information systems,Hot spot analysis,Urbanization,Istanbul,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used remote sensing image to research the LUCC, ecosystem service value (ESV), and ecological economic harmony (EEH) in eight main urban areas of Harbin in China from 1990 to 2015. The results show that, in the past 25 years, arable land-which is a part of ecological land-is the main source of construction land for urbanization, whereas the other ecological land is the main source of conversion to arable land. There is no significant change in the value ratio of ESV, however, it is also inclined to the southeast of the study area in spaces like the barycenter of LUCC. The EEH degree has risen from the potential crisis area to the medium coordination degree, and then dropped to the low coordination degree. This shows that although there has been limited change of LUCC, ESV, and EEH in eight main urban areas of Harbin in 25 years, there is a contradiction between the allocation of ecological land and non-ecological land.",land use,cover change,ecosystem service value,ecological economic harmony,Harbin,,,"Zhang, Jiquan","Wang, Aoyang",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under a GIS-approach, we used remote sensing techniques for LULC mapping, Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) for scenario building and carbon assessment, as well as the Sis software suite for forest growth and production simulation. All scenarios contributed to increasing carbon storage and sequestration and provided profitable economic opportunities. The introduction of Eucalyptus trees in livestock and agricultural production systems is an alternative for diversification and income increase, contributing to the balance of greenhouse gases (GHG) from livestock activity and adding value to production.

However, uncertainties in global land cover data and their impacts on ESV estimation have not been fully recognized. Considerably inflated estimates of land cover change and ESV change could be derived using a direct map comparison approach when classification uncertainties are not explicitly taken into account. This study collected all available global land cover datasets and applied an ensemble approach to derive the range and central tendency of terrestrial ESV estimates. Different input data caused ESV estimate varying between 35.0 and 56.5 trillion Ind/year. Wetland classes, albeit having the highest per unit value, were the most uncertain classes mapped using satellite data. To reduce uncertainty, a spatial data harmonization procedure was developed, which resulted in an improved ESV estimate at 49.4 trillion Ind/year. The study further illustrated the quantification of changes in forest ESV using a high-resolution global forest cover change dataset. An ESV loss of 716.0 billion Ind/year was estimated between 2000 and 2012 a result representing one fifth of previous estimates. These findings highlighted the importance of improving the characterization and monitoring of land cover for global ESV and change estimation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Land use changes can increase C loss rates which are extremely difficult to reverse, in the short term, opposite to organic carbon (OC) which accumulates in soil in the long-term. The aim of this research is to improve and test methodologies to assess land cover change (LCC) dynamics and temporal and spatial variability in C stored in vegetation at a wide scale. LCCs between 1956 and 2007 in Andalusia (Southern Spain) were selected for this pilot study, assessed by comparison of spatial data from 1956 to 2007 and were reclassified following land cover flows (LCFs) reported in major areas in Europe. Carbon vegetation densities were related to land cover, and C vegetation stocks for 1956 and 2007 were calculated by multiplying C density for each land cover class with land cover areas. The study area has supported important changes during the studied period with significant consequences for vegetation C stocks, mainly due to afforestation and intensification of agriculture, resulting in a total vegetation C stock of 156.08 Tg in 2007, with an increase of 17.24 Tg since 1956. This study demonstrates the importance of LCC for C sequestration in vegetation from Mediterranean areas, highlighting possible directions for management policies in order to mitigate climate change as well as promoting land conservation.

In this work, the Yearly Land Cover Dynamics (YLCD) approach, which is based on annual behavior of LST and NDVI, has been used to classify an agricultural area into crop types. To this end, a time series of Landsat-5 images for year 2009 of the Barrax (Spain) area has been processed: georeferenciation, destriping and atmospheric correction have been carried out to estimate NDVI and LST time series for year 2009, from which YLCD parameters were estimated. Then, a maximum likelihood classification was carried out on these parameters based on a training dataset obtained from a crop census. This classification has an accuracy of 87% (kappa = 0.85) when crops are subdivided in irrigated and non-irrigated fields, and when cereal crops are aggregated in a single crop, and performs better than a similar classification from Landsat bands only. These results show that a good crop differentiation can be obtained although detailed crop separation may be difficult between similar crops (barley, wheat and oat) due to similar annual NDVI and LST behavior. Therefore, the YLCD approach is suited for vegetation classification at local scale. As regards the assessment of the YLCD approach for classification at regional and global scale, it will be carried out in a further study. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
